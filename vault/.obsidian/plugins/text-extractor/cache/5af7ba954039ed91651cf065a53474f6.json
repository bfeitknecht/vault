Proof: (using Lemma 3.15.(ii): The relation ⪰ is transitive: A ⪰ B ∧ B ⪰ C ⟹ A ⪰ C ) (using Definition 3.42.(iii): A set A is called countable if A ⪰ N , and uncountable otherwise) N ⪰ A ∧ A ⪰ B ⟹ N ⪰ B ■ b ) Prove: The set S = { f u n c t io n s  { 0 , 1 } → { 0 , 1 } ∞ } is uncountable. Proof: W e will prove this using contradiction. Let's assume the set S is countable, so S ∼ N . This means, that there is a one to one mapping onto each unique value (bijection) between functions f n to N . Let us define f n as follows: f n d e f = β n , 0 , β n , 1 , β n , 2 , β n , 3 , . . . For some n ∈ N Let β n , i be the i-th bit in the n-th sequence f n where for convenience we begin numbering the bits with i = 0 . Let – b be the complement of a bit b ∈ { 0 , 1 } . W e define a new semi-infinite binary sequence α as follows: α d e f = β n , 0 , β n , 1 , β n , 2 , β n , 3 , . . . Obviously , α ∈ { 0 , 1 } ∞ but there is no n ∈ N such that α = f n since α is constructed so as to disagree in at least one bit (actually the i-th bit) with every sequence f n for n ∈ N . This shows that there cannot be an bijection from f n to N , which concludes the proof. W e have shown that N ⪰ S and S is thus uncountable using Cantor's diagonalization argument. ■ ––––","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
