Prove that F ≡ G by providing a sequence of equivalence transformations with at most 9 steps. Solution Let’s prove that G ≡ F by a sequence of equivalence transformations. G ≡ ((¬A ∨ ¬B) → (A ∧ ¬B)) ∧ (C ∨ A) ≡ ((¬(A ∧ B) → (A ∧ ¬B)) ∧ (C ∨ A)) 1st Step (de Morgan’s rule) ≡ ((¬¬(A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ ¬B)) ∧ (C ∨ A)) 2nd Step (A → B ≡ ¬A ∨ B) ≡ ((A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ ¬B)) ∧ (C ∨ A) 3rd Step (double negation) ≡ (A ∨ (B ∧ ¬B)) ∧ (C ∨ A)) 4th Step (first distributive law) ≡ (A ∨ ⊥) ∧ (C ∨ A)) 5th Step (B ∧ ¬B ≡ ⊥) ≡ (A ∨ ⊥) ∧ (A ∨ C)) 6th Step (associativity) ≡ (A ∨ (⊥ ∧ C)) 7th Step (second distributive law) ≡ (A ∨ ⊥) 8th Step (⊥ ∧ C ≡ ⊥) ≡ A 9th Step (A ∧ ⊥ ≡ A) Thus the formula G |= A. ■ 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
