The solution to these exercises must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 7.1 The Greatest Common Divisor (⋆) If d = gcd(a, b) then one can write d as a linear combination of a and b (Corollary 4.5). In this exercise we show that when d = 1 the converse is also true. More formally, prove that for all a, b, u, v ∈ Z \\ {0} such that ua + vb = 1, we have gcd(a, b) = 1. 7.2 Geometric Interpretation of the Greatest Common Divisor (⋆ ⋆) Let a, b ∈ N. In the cartesian plane, consider the segment with endpoints (0, 0) and (a, b). Show that the number of points with integer coordinates on this segment is gcd(a, b) + 1. 7.3 Properties of Greatest Common Divisors (⋆) (8 Points) Prove that for all positive integers a, b, c gcd(a, lcm(b, c)) = lcm(gcd(a, b), gcd(a, c)). Hint: use expressions from section 4.3.3. 7.4 Congruences a) (⋆) Prove that for all m, n ∈ N, if m ≡4 n, then 123m ≡10 33n. b) (⋆) Prove that for all a, b, c, d, m ∈ Z such that m > 0, if a ≡m b and c ≡m d, then ac ≡m bd. c) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Prove that there do not exist m, n ∈ Z, such that n5 + 7 = m2. 7.5 Modular Arithmetic (⋆) a) Prove that 7 | (13n + 6) for every even integer n ≥ 0. b) Prove that for any a, e, m, n ∈ N \\ {0}, if Rm(ae) = 1, then Rm(an) = Rm(aRe(n)). c) Using the above fact and the fact that R13(212) = 1, compute R13(22023). 7.6 Multiplicative Inverses a) (⋆) Let a, m ∈ N with m > 0. Show how given any u and v such that ua + vm = 1, one can compute the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. b) (⋆ ⋆) Compute the multiplicative inverse of 142 modulo 553. Hint: Use Lemma 4.2 to ﬁnd gcd(142, 553), and, at the same time, u and v, such that gcd(142, 553) = 142u + 553v. 7.7 Solution of a Congruence Equation (⋆ ⋆) Prove that for all a, b, m ∈ Z such that m > 0, the equation ax ≡m b has a solution x ∈ Z if and only if gcd(a, m) | b. 7.8 The Chinese Remainder Theorem (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) a) Show that for all a, b ∈ Z and n, m ∈ N \\ {0} such that gcd(n, m) = 1 we have a ≡nm b ⇐⇒ a ≡n b ∧ a ≡m b b) Let a, b, c be pairwise relatively prime integers. For n = ab, m = ac and integers y1, y2 such that 0 ≤ y1 < n and 0 ≤ y2 < m, consider the following system of congruence equations: x ≡n y1 x ≡m y2 How many solutions 0 ≤ x < nm does the above system of equations have, depend- ing on a, b, c and y1, y2?
