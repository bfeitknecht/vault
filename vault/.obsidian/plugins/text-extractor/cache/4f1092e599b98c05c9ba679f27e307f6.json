December 2023 Prof. Ueli Maurer Giovanni Deligios Diskrete Mathematik Exercise 12 Exercise 12.5 gives bonus points, which can increase the ﬁnal grade. The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 12.1 CNF and DNF (⋆) a) Let F = (¬(A → C)) ↔ (A → B). Using the method of function tables, construct a formula in CNF that is equivalent to F and a formula in DNF that is equivalent to F . b) Let G = (A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (¬A ∧ (C ∧ D)). Using the equivalences from Lemma 6.1, con- struct a formula in CNF that is equivalent to G. In each step write which equivalence you use. 12.2 Free Variables (⋆) Determine all occurrences of free variables in the following formulas: i) ∀x∀y (P (x, y) ∨ P (x, z)) ii) ∀x (∃x P (x) ∧ P (x)) ∨ P (x) iii) ∀x (∃y P (y, x) ∨ ∃z Q(x, f (z)) ) 12.3 Interpretations (⋆) a) Which of the interpretations i), ii) and iii) are models for the following formula? Justify your answers. (The symbol | denotes the divisibility relation.) F = ∀x∀y∀z (P (f (x, y), x) ∧ P (f (x, y), y) ∧ (¬P (x, y) → ¬P (x, f (y, z)) )) i) U A = N \\ {0}, f A(x, y) = x · y, P A(x, y) = 1 ⇐⇒ y | x ii) U A = N \\ {0}, f A(x, y) = xy, P A(x, y) = 1 ⇐⇒ y | x iii) U A = P(N), f A(A, B) = A ∩ B, P A(A, B) = 1 ⇐⇒ A ⊆ B b) Let G = (∀x ∃y P (x, y)) ∧ (∀y ∃x P (x, y)) ∧ (∀x ∀y (P (x, y) → ¬P (y, x)) ). Find an interpretation with a ﬁnite universe that is i) not suitable for G. ii) suitable but not a model for G. iii) suitable and a model for G. 12.4 Predicate Logic with Equality (⋆) We extend the syntax and the semantics of predicate logic as follows: Syntax: If t1 and t2 are terms, then (t1 = t2) is a formula. Semantics: If F is of the form (t1 = t2) for terms t1 and t2, then A(F ) = 1 if and only if A(t1) = A(t2). a) Let F = ∀x∀y (x = y). Find the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for an interpreta- tion A to be a model for F . Justify your answer. b) Let G = ∃x∃y ¬(x = y). Find the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for an interpre- tation A to be a model for G. Justify your answer. c) Find a formula with equality H, such that for any interpretation A suitable for H, we have A(H) = 1 ⇐⇒ |U A| ≥ 3. 12.5 A New Quantiﬁer ⃝ (⋆) (8 Points) We extend predicate logic with a new quantiﬁer ⃝ (read: for many) as follows: Syntax: If F is a formula, then for any variable symbol xi, ⃝xi F is a formula. Semantics: A(⃝xi F ) = 1 if and only if {u ∈ U A | A[xi→u](F ) = 1 } ∼ U A.1 Using the semantics of predicate logic extended in this way, prove or disprove the follow- ing statements, where F is an arbitrary formula. a) The formula (⃝x F ) ∧ (⃝x ¬F ) is unsatisﬁable. b) ⃝x F |= ∃x F . c) ∀x⃝yF |= ⃝y∀xF . Expectation: If the statement is true, your proof should use the deﬁnitions of the semantics. In each step, at most one deﬁnition (e.g., the semantics of ⃝) should be applied. If the statement is not true, you should provide a counterexample: make sure to deﬁne everything needed for a suitable interpretation. 12.6 Statements About Formulas (⋆ ⋆) Prove or disprove each of the following statements. Do not use any theorems or lemmas from the lecture notes. Note that x may appear free in F , G or both. a) For any formulas F and G, we have ∀x (F ∧ G) |= (∀x F ) ∧ G. b) For any formulas F and G, we have ∃x (F ∧ G) |= (∃x F ) ∧ G. 1The symbol ∼ for equinumerous was introduced in Deﬁnition 3.42-(i). For sets A and B we have A ∼ B if and only if there exists a bijection f : A → B. Due by 14. December 2023. Exercise 12.5 is graded.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
