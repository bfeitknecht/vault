November 2023 Prof. Ueli Maurer Giovanni Deligios Diskrete Mathematik Exercise 10 Exercise 10.5 gives bonus points, which can increase the ﬁnal grade. The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 10.1 Warm-Up (⋆) a) What is the deﬁnition of a ﬁeld? b) What is the deﬁnition of a root of a polynomial a(x) ∈ R[x]? c) Is the polynomial b(x) = x2 + 2 ∈ GF(3)[x] irreducible? If not, give its factorization. 10.2 Integral Domains and Fields a) (⋆) Recall an example of an integral domain that is not a ﬁeld. b) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Prove that every ﬁnite integral domain D is a ﬁeld. Hint: For an a ∈ D \\ {0}, consider the function fa(x) = a · x. 10.3 Polynomials over a Field (⋆) a) Divide x5 + 6x2 + 5 by 5x2 + 2x + 1 over Z7 with remainders. b) Determine all irreducible polynomials of degree 4 over GF(2). 10.4 The Ring F [x]m(x) (⋆ ⋆) a) Find all zero-divisors in the ring GF(3)[x]x2+2x. b) Determine all elements of GF(3)[x]x2+2 and of the multiplicative group GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2. c) Compute the inverse of the polynomial x in GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2. 10.5 Extension Fields (⋆) (8 Points) Let F = Z5[x]x2+4x+1. a) Prove that F is a ﬁeld. b) Prove that F ∗ = ⟨x + 3⟩. Show your work. c) Write a(y) = (2x + 3)y2 + (2x + 1)y + 1 ∈ F [y] as a product of irreducible polynomials. Hint: 2x + 1 ≡x2+4x+1 2(x + 3) in Z5[x]. 10.6 Secret Sharing (⋆ ⋆) We ﬁnd ourselves on a lonely island, where the ballistic missile system can be activated with a secret key s ∈ GF(q) (where q is a prime). This key is distributed among n < q generals G1, . . . , Gn as follows: random coefﬁcients a1, . . . , at−1 ∈ GF(q) are chosen, such that a(x) def = at−1xt−1 + . . . + a1x + s. Each general Gi receives a share si = a(αi), where α1, . . . , αn are publicly known and pair- wise distinct values from GF(q) \\ {0}. a) All except t generals die on a ﬁshing trip. Show that the key is not lost, because it can be determined uniquely from t shares. b) Mario (one of the generals) wants to resolve a dispute with his neighbor by using a ballistic missile. In order to determine the key s, he has collected a total of t − 1 shares (including her own share). How many values from GF(q) are still possible for the key, given t − 1 shares? Prove your answer. 10.7 Structure of Multiplicative Groups of Finite Fields (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) In this exercise we break down the proof of Theorem 5.40 from the lecture notes in smaller steps. Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld and let n = |F ∗|. a) Let a, b ∈ Z. Prove that gcd(a, b) = d ⇐⇒ d | a and d | b and gcd ( a d , b d ) = 1. b) For d | n deﬁne A(d) = {k ∈ {1, . . . , n} | gcd(k, n) = d}. Use subtask a) to prove that |A(d)| = ϕ ( n d ). c) Use subtask b) to prove that ∑ d|n ϕ ( n d ) = n. d) Use subtask c) to prove n = ∑ d|n ϕ(n). e) Let B(d) = {k ∈ F ∗ | ord(k) = d}. Show that |B(d)| ∈ {0, ϕ(d)}. Hint: consider the polynomial xd − 1 ∈ F [x]. f) Use subtasks d) and e) to show that if d | n then |B(d)| = ϕ(d). g) Use subtask f) to conclude that F ∗ is cyclic.
