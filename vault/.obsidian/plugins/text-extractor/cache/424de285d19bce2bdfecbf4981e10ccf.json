The counterex- ample is the following: 2 ⋆ (0 ⋆ 0) = 2 ⋆ 0 = 4 ̸= 16 = 4 ⋆ 0 = (2 ⋆ 0) ⋆ 0 b) ⟨P(X); ∪⟩ is a commutative monoid but not a group. Associativity and commutativity of ∪ follow directly from Theorem 3.4. The neutral element is ∅, because (1) A ∪ ∅ = ∅ ∪ A = A for all A and (2) ∅ ∈ P(X), since ∅ ⊆ X for any X. To prove that it is not a group, we give a counterexample to G3. Since X ̸= ∅, there exists an x ∈ X. Therefore, {x} ∈ P(X). Assume for contradiction that there exists an inverse element of {x}, that is, assume that there exists an A ∈ P(X) such that {x} ∪ A = ∅. But since x ∈ {x} ∪ A, this is a contradiction. c) It is a group. zWe prove the three properties separately. • G1 (associativity). Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f ) ∈ S be arbitrary. We have ((a, b) ∗ (c, d)) ∗ (e, f ) = (ac, ad + b) ∗ (e, f ) = (ace, acf + ad + b). Moreover, we have (a, b) ∗ ((c, d) ∗ (e, f )) = (a, b) ∗ (ce, cf + d) = (ace, a(cf + d) + b) = (ace, acf + ad + b). • G2 (neutral element). The neutral element is e = (1, 0). This is because for any (a, b) ∈ S we have (a, b) ∗ e = (a, b) ∗ (1, 0) = (a · 1, a · 0 + b) = (a, b) and e ∗ (a, b) = (1, 0) ∗ (a, b) = (1 · a, 1 · b + 0) = (a, b). • G3 (inverse). Let (a, b) ∈ S be arbitrary. Using that a ̸= 0, let (x, y) = ( 1 a , −b a ). Observe that (a, b) ∗ (x, y) = (a, b) ∗ ( 1 a , −b a ) = (a · 1 a , a · −b a + b ) = (1, 0) = e. Thus, (x, y) ∈ S is a right inverse of (a, b). As shown in the lecture notes (see Section 5.2.4), this implies that (x, y) is also a left inverse of (a, b). 8.2 Facts About Groups a) We have to show that e is also a left neutral element. For any a ∈ G, we have e ∗ a G3 = (a ∗ ̂a) ∗ a G1 = a ∗ (̂a ∗ a) G3 = a ∗ e G2’ = a b) We have to show that ̂b ∗ ̂a is the right inverse of a ∗ b, that is, that (a ∗ b) ∗ (̂b ∗ ̂a) = e (as proved in the lecture notes, this implies that (̂b ∗ ̂a) ∗ (a ∗ b) = e). (a ∗ b) ∗ (̂b ∗ ̂a) G1 = a ∗ (b ∗ (̂b ∗ ̂a) ) G1 = a ∗ ((b ∗ ̂b) ∗ ̂a ) G3 = a ∗ (e ∗ ̂a) G2 = a ∗ ̂a G3 = e c) For any a, b, c ∈ G, we have a ∗ b = a ∗ c G3 =⇒ ̂a ∗ (a ∗ b) = ̂a ∗ (a ∗ c) G1 =⇒ (̂a ∗ a) ∗ b = (̂a ∗ a) ∗ c G3 =⇒ e ∗ b = e ∗ c G2 =⇒ b = c 8.3 Group Structure induced by Bijections a) We prove that associativity axiom G1 is satisﬁed (for ⟨S, ⋆⟩). Let x, y, z, ∈ S. (x ⋆ y) ⋆ z = f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1(y)) ⋆ z (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) = f (f −1 (f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1(y) ) ) ∗ f −1(z) ) (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) = f ((f −1(x) ∗ f −1(y)) ∗ f −1(z) ) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (f −1(x) ∗ (f −1(y) ∗ f −1(z) )) (G1 for G) = f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1 (f (f −1(y) ∗ f −1(z)))) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1(y ⋆ z) ) (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) = x ⋆ (y ⋆ z). (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) b) Now, we prove that the neutral element axiom G2’ is satisﬁed (for ⟨S, ⋆⟩). Let x ∈ S. x ⋆ f (e) = f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1 (f (e)) ) (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) = f (f −1(x) ∗ e) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (f −1(x)) (G2 for G) = x (f ◦ f −1 = idH ) Finally, we prove that the inverse axiom G3’ is satisﬁed (for ⟨S, ⋆⟩). Let x ∈ S. x ⋆ ̃x = x ⋆ f ( ̂f −1(x)) (Deﬁnition of ̃ ) = f (f −1(x) ∗ f −1 (f ( ̂f −1(x) ))) (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) = f (f −1(x) ∗ ̂f −1(x) ) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (e) (G3 for G) From the lecture notes and Task 8.2 we know that axioms G1, G2’, and G3’ imply G2 and G3. c) We prove that f is a group homomorphism. Let a, b ∈ G. f (a ∗ b) = f (f −1(f (a)) ∗ b ) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (f −1(f (a)) ∗ f −1(f (b)) ) (f −1 ◦ f = idG) = f (a) ⋆ f (b) (Deﬁnition of ⋆ ) Since f is bijective by assumption, then f is a group isomorphism. d) Let A be a non-empty countable set. By Theorem 3.17 we know that either A is ﬁnite, or A ∼ N. We treat these two cases separately. - (A is ﬁnite) Then there is a ﬁnite M ⊆ N and a bijection g : M → A. Let k = |M |. Since N is well-ordered, we can order the elements of M as m1 < m2 < . . . mk. Now, consider the function h : Zk → M deﬁned as i 7→ mi. This map is easily veriﬁed to be a bijection, so that g ◦ h is a bijection from Zk to A. The claim follows from subtask a), by observing that ⟨Zk, ⊕⟩ is a group. - (A ∼ N) Then there exists a bijection g : N → A. Since Z is countable, there exists a bijection h : Z → N. Therefore, the composition g ◦ h is a bijection Z → A, and the claim follows from subtask a), by observing that ⟨Z, +⟩ is a group. 8.4 Structure of Groups a) There are 6 subgroups: {(0, 0)}, {0, 2} × {0}, Z4 × {0}, {0} × Z5, {0, 2} × Z5, Z4 × Z5 You are not required to formally justify why these are all subgroups. b) Take arbitrary a, b ∈ G. Since a ∗ a = e and b ∗ b = e, we have a = ̂a, b = ̂b and a ∗ b = da ∗ b. Hence, a ∗ b = da ∗ b Lemma 5.3 = ̂b ∗ ̂a = b ∗ a. c) Let ⟨G; ∗,̂, e⟩ be an abelian group. Let a, b ∈ G and deﬁne n = ord(a) and m = ord(b). We show that if nm = |G| and ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e} then G ≃ Zn × Zm. Consider the subset S ⊆ G deﬁned as S = {ax ∗ by | x ∈ Zn and y ∈ Zm}. Clearly S is a subgroup of G. Since ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩ = {e} we have |S| ≥ nm = |G| so that S = G. Now, consider the map ϕ : G → Zn × Zm, a x ∗ b y 7→ (x, y). The map ϕ is a group homomorphism: ϕ(g ∗ h) = ϕ ((ax ∗ b y) ∗ (a x′ ∗ b y′)) (S = G) = ϕ (a x+x′ ∗ b y+y′) (Commutativity of ∗) = (x ⊕ x′, y ⊕ y′) (Deﬁnition of ϕ) = (x, y) ⊕ (x ′, y′) (Deﬁnition of direct product) = ϕ(a x ∗ b y) ⊕ ϕ (ax′ ∗ b y′) (Deﬁnition of ϕ) = ϕ(g) ⊕ ϕ(h) (S = G). Furthermore, the map ϕ is surjective, and since |Zn × Zm| = nm = |G| then we conclude it is bijective, and a group isomorphism. Now, consider ⟨Z ∗ 15, ⊙15⟩ = ⟨{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}, ⊙15⟩, Direct computation shows ord(2) = 4 and ord(11) = 2. Since |Z∗ 15| = ϕ(15) = 8, we have ord(2) ord(11) = |Z∗ 15|. Again, direct computation shows that ⟨2⟩ ∩ ⟨11⟩ = {1}. Therefore, by the argument above, we have Z∗ 15 ≃ Z4 × Z2. Consider ⟨Z ∗ 16, ⊙16⟩ = ⟨{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}, ⊙16⟩. Direct computation shows ord(3) = 4 and ord(7) = 2. Since |Z∗ 16| = ϕ(16) = 8, we have ord(3) ord(7) = |Z∗ 16|. Again, direct computation shows that ⟨3⟩ ∩ ⟨7⟩ = {1}. Therefore, by the argument above, we have Z∗ 16 ≃ Z4 × Z2. This shows Z∗ 16 ≃ Z4 × Z2 ≃ Z∗ 15. 8.5 A Binary Operation From a Group Homomorphism First, observe that for any x, y, z ∈ G we have: x · (y · z) = ψ(x) ∗ ψ(y · z) (def. ·) = ψ(x) ∗ ψ(ψ(y) ∗ ψ(z)) (def. ·) = ψ(x) ∗ (ψ(ψ(y)) ∗ ψ(ψ(z))) (ψ homomorphism) Moreover, we have (x · y) · z = ψ(x · y) ∗ ψ(z) (def. ·) = ψ(ψ(x) ∗ ψ(y)) ∗ ψ(z) (def. ·) = (ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ ψ(ψ(y))) ∗ ψ(z) (ψ homomorphism) We prove each direction (=⇒ and ⇐=) of the claim separately. • =⇒: Assume that · is associative. Let x ∈ G be arbitrary. We have x · (e · e) = ψ(x) ∗ (ψ(ψ(e)) ∗ ψ(ψ(e))) (above) = ψ(x) ∗ (ψ(e) ∗ ψ(e)) (L5.5 (i)) = ψ(x) ∗ (e ∗ e) (L5.5 (i)) = ψ(x) ∗ e (G2) = ψ(x) (G2) Analogously, we have (x · e) · e = (ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ ψ(ψ(e))) ∗ ψ(e) (above) = (ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ ψ(e)) ∗ e (L5.5 (i)) = (ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ e) ∗ e (L5.5 (i)) = ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ e (G2) = ψ(ψ(x)) (G2) Since · is associative, we must have x · (e · e) = (x · e) · e. Hence, ψ(x) = ψ(ψ(x)). • ⇐=: Assume that ψ is idempotent. Then, we have for any x, y, z ∈ G: x · (y · z) = ψ(x) ∗ (ψ(ψ(y)) ∗ ψ(ψ(z))) (above) = ψ(x) ∗ (ψ(ψ(y)) ∗ ψ(z)) (ψ idemp.) = ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ (ψ(ψ(y)) ∗ ψ(z)) (ψ idemp.) = (ψ(ψ(x)) ∗ ψ(ψ(y))) ∗ ψ(z) (G1) = (x · y) · z (above) 8.6 Isomorphisms Map Generators to Generators Take an arbitrary h ∈ H and let a = ψ−1(h) (the inverse of ψ exists, because ψ is bijective). Since g is a generator, there exists an m ∈ Z such that a = gm. • If m = 0, then by Lemma 5.5 (i), h = ψ(g0) = ψ(e) = e′ = ψ(g)0, where e and e′ are the neutral elements of G and H, respectively. • If m > 0, then h = ψ(gm) = ψ(g)m, where the last step is trivial for m = 1 and otherwise follows from applying the deﬁnition of a homomorphism m − 1 times. • If m < 0, then h = ψ(gm) = ψ((̂g)|m|) = ψ(̂g)|m| = ( gψ(g))|m| = ψ(g)m, where the third step is justiﬁed as above, and the fourth step follows from Lemma 5.5 (ii). 8.7 Rotations of a Cube a) First of all, one has to decide which corner of the sofa coincides with the corner of the room. For this, there are 8 possibilities. Once this corner is set, there are 3 edges coming out of this corner (one of them going up) and, hence, 3 possibilities to place the sofa. Once the corner and the edge going up are ﬁxed, the position of the sofa is fully deﬁned. Hence, there are 3 · 8 = 24 possibilities overall. b) Let us ﬁrst determine |R|. Assume that the sofa stands in the corner in a certain (ar- bitrary) position. After a rotation b, it may end up in one of the 24 possible positions (this follows from Subtask a) ). Therefore, we can distinguish 24 different rotations and |R| = 24. It is possible to describe each element of R as a rotation around single axis. To see this, consider all possible different rotations of a cube around an axis: • Identity. • Rotation around the centers of two opposite faces. There are 3 pairs of opposite faces and for each pair there are 3 possible rotations: by 90, 180 and 270 degrees. Together, this gives 9 rotations. • Rotation around two opposite vertices. There are 4 pairs of opposite vertices and for each pair there are 2 possible rotations: by 120 and 240 degrees. Together, this gives 8 rotations • Rotation around the centers of two opposite edges. There are 6 pairs of oppo- site edges and for each pair there is only one possible rotation: by 180 degrees. Together, this gives 6 rotations. One can see (for example by drawing the cube after each rotation) that no two of the above rotations end up with the cube being in the same position. Since together we described 24 rotations and |R| = 24, each element of R corresponds to exactly one rotation. c) ⟨R; ◦⟩ is a group. Since function composition is associative, ◦ is associative as well (this is because every rotation corresponds to a permutation of vertices). The neutral element is the identity. Furthermore, every element has an inverse, namely a rotation around the same axis by 360 degrees minus the original angle. d) The operation ◦ is not commutative. Figure 1 illustrates that there exist rotations, which do not commute. 0 1 23 4 5 67 ⇒ 3 0 12 7 4 56 ⇒ 7 3 26 4 0 15 0 1 23 4 5 67 ⇒ 4 0 37 5 1 26 ⇒ 7 4 03 6 5 12 Figure 1: ⟨R; ◦⟩ is not commutative.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
