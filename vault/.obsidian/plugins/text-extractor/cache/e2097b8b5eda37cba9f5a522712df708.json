We want to prove that P (k) = 1 for all k ≥ 1. We proceed by induction. Basis Step. The statement P (1) is proven to be true in Lemma 2.7. Induction Step. Assume that P (k) = 1. We want to show that P (k + 1) = 1. Suppose that a certain truth assignment of the propositional symbols A1, . . . , Ak+1, B makes the formula (A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak+1) ∧ (A1 → B) ∧ · · · ∧ (Ak+1 → B) true. This means that (Ai → B) is true for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k + 1} and (A0 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak+1) is true. Since (A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak+1) is true, then Ai must be true for some i ∈ {1, . . . , k + 1}. We distinguish two cases: • Case 1: Ak+1 is true. Since Ak+1 → B is true, then B must be true under the given truth assignment (modus ponens). • Case 2: Ak+1 is false. Since (A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak+1) is true, then Ai must be true for some i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Since by induction hypothesis we know that P (k) = 1, this means that B is true under the given truth assignment. The case distinction is sound because under a given truth assignment Ak+1 is true or false. This shows that P (k) = 1 ⇒ P (k + 1) = 1 for all k ≥ 1. By induction, we conclude that P (k) = 1 for all k ≥ 1. 4.2 Element or Subset i) A ∈ B and A ̸⊆ B ii) A ∈ B and A ⊆ B iii) A /∈ B and A ⊆ B iv) A ∈ B and A ⊆ B 4.3 Operations on Sets The following sets fulﬁll the conditions: a) A = {∅} For x = ∅ we have x ∈ A. Also, the empty set is the subset of any other set, so x ⊆ A. This is not the only solution. For example, A = {7, {7}} also fulﬁlls the given condition. b) A = {∅, 1} We have P(A) = {∅, {∅}, {1}, {∅, 1}}. Since 1 ̸∈ P(A), it holds that A ̸⊆ P(A). Also, for x = ∅ we have x ∈ A and x ⊆ P(A) (since the empty set is the subset of any set). c) A = ∅ We have ∅ ⊆ P(A). The second requirement is trivially fulﬁlled, since A has no elements. 4.4 Cardinality First, notice that A = {∅, {∅}}. With that said, we give the solutions to individual sub- tasks: i) A ∪ B = {∅, {∅}, {{∅}}, {∅, {∅}}}, |A ∪ B| = 4 ii) A ∩ B = {{∅}}, |A ∩ B| = 1 iii) ∅ × A = ∅, |∅ × A| = 0 iv) {0} × {3, 1} = {(0, 3), (0, 1)}, |{0} × {3, 1}| = 2 v) {{1, 2}} × {3} = {({1, 2}, 3)}, |{{1, 2}} × {3}| = 1 vi) P({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}, |P({∅})| = 2 4.5 Proving/Disproving Set Properties a) We show both inclusions at once. x ∈ A \\ (B \\ C) · ⇐⇒ x ∈ A ∧ ¬(x ∈ B \\ C) (Deﬁnition of X \\ Y ) · ⇐⇒ x ∈ A ∧ ¬(x ∈ B ∧ ¬(x ∈ C)) (Deﬁnition of X \\ Y ) · ⇐⇒ x ∈ A ∧ (¬(x ∈ B) ∨ ¬¬(x ∈ C)) (De Morgan’s rule) · ⇐⇒ x ∈ A ∧ (¬(x ∈ B) ∨ x ∈ C) (Double Negation) · ⇐⇒ (x ∈ A ∧ ¬(x ∈ B)) ∨ (x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ C) (Distributivity) · ⇐⇒ (x ∈ A \\ B) ∨ (x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ C) (Deﬁnition of X \\ Y ) · ⇐⇒ (x ∈ A \\ B) ∨ (x ∈ A ∩ C) (Deﬁnition of ∩) · ⇐⇒ x ∈ (A \\ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) (Deﬁnition of ∪) b) We have 2 =|P(A) ∩ P(B)| (Assumption) =|P(A ∩ B)| (Proof as in Exercise 4.6 a)) =2 |A∩B| (Lecture Notes 3.2.8) Therefore 2 = 2|A∩B| · ⇐⇒ |A ∩ B| = 1. c) We disprove the statement by providing a counterexample. Let A = {1, 2}, let B = {1}, and let C = {1, 3}. We have B ⊆ A because 1 ∈ A. Furthermore B ∩ C = {1} ̸= ∅. However, C ⊈ A because 3 ∈ C but 3 /∈ A. 4.6 Relating Two Power Sets a) For any C, we have C ∈ P(A ∩ B) · ⇐⇒ C ⊆ A ∩ B (deﬁnition of P) · ⇐⇒ ∀c (c ∈ C → c ∈ A ∩ B) (deﬁnition of ⊆) · ⇐⇒ ∀c (c ∈ C → (c ∈ A ∧ c ∈ B) ) (deﬁnition of ∩) · ⇐⇒ ∀c ((c ∈ C → c ∈ A) ∧ (c ∈ C → c ∈ B) ) (∗) · ⇐⇒ ∀c (c ∈ C → c ∈ A) ∧ ∀c (c ∈ C → c ∈ B) (∗∗) · ⇐⇒ C ⊆ A ∧ C ⊆ B (deﬁnition of ⊆) · ⇐⇒ C ∈ P(A) ∧ C ∈ P(B) (deﬁnition of P) · ⇐⇒ C ∈ P(A) ∩ P(B) (deﬁnition of ∩) (∗) We use the fact that for any formulas A1, A2 and A3, we have A1 → (A2 ∧ A3) ≡ ¬A1 ∨ (A2 ∧ A3) ≡ (¬A1 ∨ A2) ∧ (¬A1 ∨ A3) ≡ (A1 → A2) ∧ (A1 → A3). (This follows from Lemma 2.1.) (∗∗) We use the fact that ∀xP (x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) ≡ ∀x(P (x) ∧ Q(x)) for any predicates P and Q (see Chapter 2.4.8 of the lecture notes). b) To prove that the statement is false, we show a counterexample. Let A = {1} and B = {2}. We have P(A) ∪ P(B) = {∅, {1}} ∪ {∅, {2}} = {∅, {1}, {2}}. On the other hand, P(A ∪ B) = P({1, 2}) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}. c) We will prove the implication in both directions separately. A ⊆ B =⇒ P(A) ⊆ P(B): Let B be any set and let A be any subset of B. What we have to show is that each element of P(A) is also an element of P(B). Let S be any element of P(A). Then, by Deﬁnition 3.7, S ⊆ A. By the assumption that A ⊆ B and by the transitivity of ⊆, it follows that S ⊆ B. This means that S is an element of P(B). P(A) ⊆ P(B) =⇒ A ⊆ B: Let A, B be any sets and assume that P(A) ⊆ P(B). Since A ∈ P(A) (which holds for any set A) and, by assumption, P(A) ⊆ P(B), we have that A ∈ P(B). By Deﬁnition 3.7, this means that A ⊆ B. 4.7 Special Families of Sets a) We prove that the statement is true by checking that all the required properties hold for A = P(X). • P(X) ⊆ P(X) trivially holds. • Since X ̸= ∅ then P(X) ̸= ∅. • Let A, B ∈ P(X). We have A ∪ B ∈ P(X) · ⇐⇒ A ∪ B ⊆ X (Deﬁnition of P) · ⇐⇒ ∀x (x ∈ A ∪ B → x ∈ X) (Deﬁnition of ⊆) · ⇐⇒ ∀x ((x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B) → x ∈ X) (Deﬁnition of ∪) · ⇐⇒ ∀x ((x ∈ A → x ∈ X) ∧ (x ∈ B → x ∈ X)) (∗) · ⇐⇒ ∀x (x ∈ A → x ∈ X) ∧ ∀x (x ∈ B → x ∈ X) (∗∗) · ⇐⇒ A ⊆ X ∧ B ⊆ X (Deﬁnition of ⊆ twice) · ⇐⇒ ⊤ (By Assumption) (∗) We use the fact that (F ∨ G) → H ≡ ¬(F ∨ G) ∨ H ≡ (¬F ∧ ¬G) ∨ H ≡ (¬F ∨ H) ∧ (¬G ∨ H) ≡ (F → H) ∧ (G → H). See Lemma 2.1. (∗∗) We use the fact that ∀xP (x) ∧ ∀xQ(x) ≡ ∀x(P (x) ∧ Q(x)) for any predicates P and Q (see Chapter 2.4.8 of the lecture notes). • Let A, B ∈ P(X), that is A, B ⊆ X. We have x ∈ A ∩ B · ⇐⇒ x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B (Deﬁnition of ∩) · =⇒ x ∈ X ∧ x ∈ X (Deﬁnition of ⊆ twice) · =⇒ x ∈ X (A ∧ A ≡ A) • Let A ∈ P(X), that is A ⊆ X. We have x ∈ X \\ A · ⇐⇒ x ∈ X ∧ x /∈ A · =⇒ x ∈ X which shows that X \\ A ⊆ X, that is X \\ A ∈ P(X). b) The statement is false. Notice that X ∈ {X}, but X \\ X = ∅ /∈ {X}. Therefore, the last property does not hold, and QX ({X}) = 0. c) The statement is true. Suppose that QX (A) = 1. This means (by the second property) that A ̸= ∅. Let A ∈ A. We have (by the last property) that X \\ A ∈ A. Therefore (by the third property) we have X = (X \\ A) ∪ A ∈ A. d) The statement is false: we provide a counterexample. Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let A = {∅, {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}} and let B = {∅, {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}. It is straight- forward to check that all the properties of QX hold for A and B, so that QX (A) = 1 and QX (B) = 1. However, consider A∪B = {∅, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}. While {1, 2}, {1, 3} ∈ A ∪ B, we have {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2} ∪ {1, 3} /∈ A ∪ B. This shows QX (A ∪ B) = 0, because the third property does not hold. e) We prove that the statement is true by checking all the properties of QX hold for A ∩ B. • For the ﬁrst property, we have A ∈ A ∩ B · ⇐⇒ A ∈ A ∧ A ∈ B (Deﬁnition of ∩) · ⇐⇒ A ∈ P(X) ∧ A ∈ P(X) (QX (A) = 1 and QX (B) = 1, Property 1) · ⇐⇒ A ∈ P(X) (A ∧ A ≡ A) • To prove the second property, we remember that from above, we know X ∈ A and X ∈ B so that X ∈ A ∩ B. This shows the intersection is not empty. • Let A, B ∈ A ∩ B. Then A, B ∈ A and A, B ∈ B by deﬁnition of intersection. Since QX (A) = 1 and QX (B) = 1, using property 3 we conclude that A ∪ B ∈ A and A ∪ B ∈ B. By deﬁnition of intersection we get A ∪ B ∈ A ∩ B. This proves property 3. • Let A, B ∈ A ∩ B. Then A, B ∈ A and A, B ∈ B by deﬁnition of intersection. Since QX (A) = 1 and QX (B) = 1, using property 4 we conclude that A ∩ B ∈ A and A ∩ B ∈ B. By deﬁnition of intersection we get A ∩ B ∈ A ∩ B. This proves property 4. • Let A ∈ A ∩ B. Then A ∈ A and A ∈ B by deﬁnition of intersection. Since QX (A) = 1 and QX (B) = 1, using property 5 we conclude that X \\ A ∈ A and X \\ A ∈ B. By deﬁnition of intersection we get X \\ A ∈ A ∩ B. This proves property 5.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
