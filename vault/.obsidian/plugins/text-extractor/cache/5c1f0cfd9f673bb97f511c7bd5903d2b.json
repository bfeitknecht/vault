Semantics: A ( ◯ x i F ) = 1 ⟺ { u ∈ U A  | A [x i → u ] ( F ) = 1 } ∼ U A . Using the semantics of predicate logic extended in this way , prove or disprove the following statements, where F is an arbitrary formula. a) The formula ( ◯ x F ) ∧ ( ◯ x ¬ F ) is unsatisfiable. b) ◯ x F ⊨ ∃ x F c) ∀ x ◯ y F ⊨ ◯ y ∀ x F Expectation: If the statement is true, your proof should use the definitions of the semantics. In each step, at most one definition (e.g., the semantics of ◯ ) should be applied. If the statement is not true, you should provide a counterexample: make sure to define everything needed for a suitable interpretation. a) The formula ( ◯ x F ) ∧ ( ◯ x ¬ F ) is unsatisfiable. Disproven by counterexample. W e want to show that there exists an interpretation A such that ( ◯ x F ∧ ( ◯ x ¬ F ) = 1 , making the formula satisfiable. Let F be the formula P ( x ) Let A = ( U , ϕ , ψ , ξ ) be a suitable interpretation for the formula. Let U A = N ∗ Let ϕ = ∅ (there are no functions in our formula) Let ψ = { P A ( x ) = 1 ⟺ x ≡ 2 0 ,  i.e . P A ( x ) = 1  if a n d o n ly if x is e v e n } Let ξ = ∅ (there are no free variables in our formula) All that remains is to show is that { u ∈ N ∣ u is e v e n ) } ∼ N and { u ∈ N ∣ u is n o t e v e n } ∼ N . W e define two sets S = { u ∈ N ∣ u  is e v e n } and T = { u ∈ N ∣ u  is n o t e v e n } and construct a bijection between them and N ∗ Let f : N → S be defined as f ( x ) = 2 ⋅ x . It's easy to see that, for every x ∈ N , f ( x ) ∈ S . Let g : N → T be defined as g ( x ) = 2 ⋅ x + 1 . Since, for every x ∈ N , f ( x ) ∈ T as f ( x ) ≡ 2 1 for all x ∈ N . Thus both parts are satisfiable under some interpretation A , disproving the statement. □ b) ◯ x F ⊨ ∃ x F W e proof this by showing that any interpretation that's suitable for both sides of the formula and is a model for ◯ x F is also a model for ∃ x F . Since any U A (where A is a model for the LHS) is equinumerous to the set { u ∈ U A  | A [x i → u ] ( F ) = 1 } and no U A can be empty (as per Definition 6.34.), that same A is also a model for ∃ x F , by definition 6.36.

Let F be the formula P ( x , y ) Let A = ( U , ϕ , ψ , ξ ) be a suitable interpretation for the formula. Let U A = N ∗ Let ϕ = ∅ (there are no functions in our formula) Let ψ = { P A ( x ) = 1 ⟺ y > x ,  i.e . P A ( x ) = 1  if a n d o n ly if y is g r e a t e r t h a n x } Let ξ = ∅ (there are no free variables in our formula) What this is saying in words is, that our chosen interpretation A is a model for the LHS (since, for all natural numbers x ∈ N ∗ , there is a set of numbers y i ∈ N ∗ equinumerous to the set of natural nubers ( { y i ∈ N ∗ } ∼ N ∗ ) that is larger than than x ) but not a model for the RHS (since, not for every number x i ∈ N all numbers y i ∈ N are larger than that number). W e have shown there exists some interpretation A that is suitable for both sides of the formula and is a model for ∀ x ◯ y F but not for ◯ y ∀ x F . □ A ( ◯ x i F ) = 1 ⋅ ⟹ { u ∈ U A  | A [x i → u ] ( F ) = 1 } ∼ U A  a n d  U A ≠ ∅ ( S e m a n t ic s o f  ◯ x i , D e f in it io n 6 .3 4 . U ≠ ∅ ) ⋅ ⟹ A [x → u ] ( F ) = 1  f o r s o m e  u ∈ U D e f in it io n 6 .3 6 . A ( ∃ x F ) ⋅ ⟹ A ( ∃ x F ) = 1 A ( ∀ x ◯ y F ) ⊨ A ( ◯ y ∀ x F ) ⋅ ⟹ A ( ∀ x ◯ y P ( x , y ) ) ⊨ A ( ◯ y ∀ x P ( x , y ) ) ( 1 ) ⋅ ⟹ A [x → u ] ( ◯ y P ( x , y ) ) = 1  f o r a ll u ∈ U A ⊨ A ( ◯ y ∀ x P ( x , y ) ) ( 2 ) ⋅ ⟹ A [x → u ] ( ◯ y P ( x , y ) ) = 1  f o r a ll u ∈ U A ⊨ { u ∈ U A ∣ { A [x → u ] ( ∀ x P ( x , y ) ) = 1 } ∼ U A ( 3 ) ⋅ ⟹ A [x → u ] ( { u ∈ U A ∣ A [y → v ] ( P ( x , y ) = 1 } ∼ U A ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ⊨ { u ∈ U A ∣ { A [y → v ] ( ∀ x P ( x , y ) ) = 1 } ∼ U A ( 4 ) ⋅ ⟹ A [x → u ] ( { u ∈ U A ∣ A [y → v ] ( P ( x , y ) = 1 } ∼ U A ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ⊨ { u ∈ U A ∣ { A [y → v ] ( A [x → u ] ( P ( x , y ) ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ) = 1 } ∼ U A ( 5 ) ⋅ ⟹ A ( { u ∈ U A ∣ A [y → v ] ( P ( y , u ) = 1 } ∼ U A ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ⊨ { u ∈ U A ∣ { A [y → u ] ( A ( P ( u , y ) ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ) = 1 } ∼ U A ( 6 ) ⋅ ⟹ A ( { u ∈ U A ∣ A ( P ( v , u ) = 1 } ∼ U A ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ⊨ { u ∈ U A ∣ { A ( A ( P ( u , v ) ) = 1  f o r a ll v ∈ U A ) = 1 } ∼ U A ( 7 ) ( 1 ) ( D e f in it io n o f  F ) ( 2 ) ( D e f in it io n 6 .3 6 . ∀ x F ) ( 3 ) ( S e m a n t ic s o f  ◯ x F ) ( 4 ) ( S e m a n t ic s o f  ◯ x F ) ( 5 ) ( D e f in it io n 6 .3 6 . ∀ x F ) ( 6 ) [x → u ] ( 7 ) [y → v ]","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
