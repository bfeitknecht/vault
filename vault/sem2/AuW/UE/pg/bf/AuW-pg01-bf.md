#### a)
We use Prim's algorithm to find the MST of $G$. Starting it on the node $A$ results in the nodes being visited in the following order, with the associated weights.

1. $D, w = 2$
2. $B, w= 3$
3. $C, w = 4$
4. $G, w = 3$
5. $F, w = 5$
6. $E, w = 4$

Thus $T$ contains the following edges:

$E_{T} = \{ \{A, D\}, \{A, B\}, \{B, C\}, \{C, G\}, \{G, F\}, \{F, E\} \}$

#### b)
We construct $Z$ as follows:

$E_Z = \{ \{A, D\}, \{D, E\}, \{E, F\}, \{F, G\}, \{G, C\}, \{C, B\}, \{B, A\} \}, \Â C_Z = 21$.

In particular, we add one edge, $e_Z = \{D, E\}, w(e_Z) = 5$. Since the rest of the edges are the ones already in the MST $T$, and $w(e_Z) < C_Z$, thus follows:

$C_Z + w(e_Z) < 2C_Z$

#### c)
The MST $T$ is, per definition, the walk of minimum length to visit every node. In order for any closed walk $Z$ on $G$ that visits all nodes to be closed, we must add an edge $e_x$ to $T$ to "close" the walk. Since $w(e_x) \geq \min(w(e_T) \ \forall e_T \in E_T$,
