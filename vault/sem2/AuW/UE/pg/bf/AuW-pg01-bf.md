a)
We use Prim's algorithm to find the MST of $G$. Starting it on the node $A$ results in the nodes being visited in the following order, with the associated weights.

1. $D, w = 2$
2. $B, w= 3$
3. $C, w = 4$
4. $G, w = 3$
5. $F, w = 5$
6. $E, w = 4$

Thus $T$ contains the following edges:

$E_{T} = \{ \{A, D\}, \{A, B\}, \{B, C\}, \{C, G\}, \{G, F\}, \{F, E\} \}$
