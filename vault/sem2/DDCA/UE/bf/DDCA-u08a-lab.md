All Mips instructions that store something back into the register wonâ€™t work anymore. 
In the controlUnit we can see all affected operations listed:
`OP_RTYPE`, `OP_LW` and `OP_ADDI`

 A 6-bit address can represent $2^6 = 64$ distinct values. In both the `DataMemory` and `InstructionMemory` modules, the memory arrays are declared as `reg [31:0] DataArr [63:0]` and `reg [31:0] InsArr [63:0]`. Thus 6 bits are enough to uniquely address each data and instruction in memory.

>[!info] `snake_pattern.asm`
>This counter keeps track of the position in the loop of snake patterns. Making it go faster, loops through the pattern faster.

>[!info] `clock_div.v`
This counter is responsible for slowing down the frequency of the processor. It is incremented on every tick of the hardware clock and every x ticks, it sends a *divided* clock output.
>```
// Instantiate an internal clock divider that will
// take the 50 MHz FPGA clock and divide it by 5 so that
// We will have a simple 10 MHz clock internally
>```

>[!info] `DispCount`, `top.v`
>This counter determines, which seven segment display to turn on (send logical 0), i.e. it controls the update frequency of an AN segment.
