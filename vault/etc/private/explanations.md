even though i feel like i'm picking at a mountain with a toothpick, i'll keep at it. once begun, halfway done. it's difficult for me to give you understanding of the situation. i can give you elaborations, i can give you reasoning, but in the end it's not solely up to me to accept myself. we need to do this together.

if only i could understand myself. i want to give myself fully to you. 

it is now my responsibility to compile what's happened and why to give you a chance at closure.
i take this very seriously. i will thoroughly search my chat histories with different people, consult the voice recordings of my talks with some of my friends regarding the time period of us starting to get closer.

i think a lot of our mutual frustration stems from a lack of complete and precise documentation. to be able to deliver just that is my goal.





as a kid, i was 10 or 11 years old, i remember sitting on the toilet when i was overcome with a sudden wave of sadness. i felt so alone. i felt like there was no one i could relate to and reveal myself to. my mother heard me crying and entered, asking what was wrong. i told her only to be met with attempts at convincing me otherwise. i didn't feel heard, but being comforted helped.



all throughout primary school i felt above everyone else, yet, paradoxically, at the same time below everyone else. i mean i was much shorter.

my first crush was tsomo. i wrote her a love letter with the help of my then babysitter (her name was meret, her brother's name also basil). she encouraged me to do it and what to write. it said, that i think she is very pretty and i would like to hold her hand. you know what happened there.

i never had any courage at all to get close to anyone all throughout primary school. i would have really fatty hair. i wasn't showering, i was only taking baths. often time shared with dimitri. one time he pooped in the bath tub. sometimes, i'd get the rest water from lukas or barbara. my nails were never neatly cut because i didn't like the feeling and it was let slide. one time my guitar teacher cut them for me, forcefully. i hated going to guitar lessons. i expressed my disgust for that teacher and his way of teaching many times. it was often sweeped under the rug.

the kids i associated myself with were mean to me a lot. they made fun of my height. to be appreciated and accepted i lied to them, that i'd had sex (i over dramaticed that time our neighbour's daughter showed me her pussy), i told them my dad was a cop or that i could speak russian. i think they were on to me. two years before we had any english i told them i could sing up in the sky perfectly (we had it in music class), they wanted to hear me sing it almost every day. their admiration must have been hidden ridicule in hindsight.

despite not feeling well placed among them, i was really scared to go to the kanti. it would mean that i'd no longer have them. i'd be truly alone. i'm glad my parents made me at least try to do the entrance exams. i studied only a couple of times.

in the kanti i met nico and jan and flurin. we bonded especially well during the autumn hike. we talked the whole time. i remember before befriending them, i'd talk with a bit of a weird fake albanian accent sometime. a thing i picked up in primary school.




it is my own responsibility to be better, to be at terms with myself and accept who and what i am and was.

i won't stop being nice to you. i will only love you harder and stronger. i will take accountability for my wrongdoings and mistakes. 

when we started to get to know each other better, i didn't think how much i'd treasure you. 

i get sick when i think about how you must feel. it's so hard to express how i feel about this situation, but you must understand, it didn't happen intentionally?
