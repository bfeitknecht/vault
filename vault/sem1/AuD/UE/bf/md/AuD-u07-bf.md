```java
int[] A;
int n = A.length;
int b;
boolean[][] dp = new boolean [n+1][b+1];

// base cases; 0 can always sum up to zero
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {dp[i][0] = true;}

for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { //loop through rows (1-n)
	for(int j = 1; j <= b; j++) { //loop through columns (1-b)
		// guard arm for cases where A[i] can be reached already
		dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
		
		if (j >= A[i-1]) {
			// using A[i] once, i.e. base cases
			dp[i][j] |= dp[i-1][j - A[i-1]];
			
			// using A[i] three times
			dp[i][j] |= dp[i-1][j - 3 * A[i-1]];
		}
	}
}
return dp[n][b]

```




1. Dimensions of the DP table: What are the dimensions of the DP table?
   The dimensions are n+1 by b+1, that is one row for every element in A and one row for all numbers to b, plus one row and column for zero. 
   
2. Subproblems: What is the meaning of each entry?
   Each entry represents the possibility of achieving the j with the subset A\[1, i] or the addition of j or 3\*j.
   
3. Recursion: How can an entry of the table be computed from previous entries? Justify why your recurrence relation is correct. Specify the base cases of the recursion, i.e., the cases that do not depend on others.
   If j can be reached with A\[i] or 3\*A\[i], the cell is set to true. These are the base cases.   
   
4. Calculation order: In which order can entries be computed so that values needed for each entry have been determined in previous steps?
   Each entry is calculated, row after row. All entries are either trivial (A\[i] or 3\*A\[i]) or a combination of previous entries.
   
5. Extracting the solution: How can the solution be extracted once the table has been filled?
   The value of dp\[n]\[b] will tell if there exists a subset $\mathbb{I}$, such that $\sum_{i\in \mathbb{I}}c_i*A[i]$, where $c_i= \{1,\,3\}$.
   
6. Running time: What is the running time of your solution?
   The running time is O(n\*b) since
   a. The outer loop runs from 1 to n, and the inner loop runs from 1 to b. Each iteration of the inner loop involves constant time operations.
   
   b. Inside the inner loop, there are constant-time operations for checking conditions and updating the DP table.

```java
int[][][] DP = new int[n + 1][k + 1][2];

// Base cases
for (int l = 0; l <= 1; l++) {
	DP[1][0][l] = 1;
}

// Filling the DP table
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
		for (int l = 0; l <= 1; l++) {
			DP[i][j][l] = DP[i - 1][j][0] + DP[i - 1][j][1];
			if (j > 0) { DP[i][j][l] += DP[i - 1][j - 1][l];
			}
		}
	}
}
// Summing up the possibilities for the last character
int result = DP[n][k][0] + DP[n][k][1];
return result;
```

1.
- `i` represents the length of the binary string.
- `j` represents the number of occurrences of "11" in the string.
- `l` represents the last digit of the string (either 0 or 1).

2.
The entry `DP[i][j][l]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` with `j` occurrences of "11" that end in `l`.

3.
The recurrence relation is given by:
`DP[i][j][l] = DP[i-1][j][0] + DP[i-1][j][1] + DP[i-1][j-1][l]`
This relation considers the possibilities of appending a 0 or a 1 to the existing strings and accounts for the occurrence of "11." The base cases are:
- `DP[1][0][0] = 1`
- `DP[1][0][1] = 1`

4.
The entries can be computed in a bottom-up manner. The outer loop iterates over the length of the string (`i`), the middle loop over the number of occurrences (`j`), and the inner loop over the last digit (`l`).

5.
Once the DP table is filled, the solution is obtained by summing up the possibilities for the last character of the string:
`result = DP[n][k][0] + DP[n][k][1];`

6.
The running time of the solution is O(nk). This is because the algorithm involves a triple-nested loop structure, where each loop can iterate up to `n`, `k`, and 2 respectively. The filling of the DP table and the final computation of the result both have a time complexity of O(nk).
