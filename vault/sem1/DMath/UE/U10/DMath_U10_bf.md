Let $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$

___

(a) Prove that $F$ is a field.

**Proof:**
$\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a field, since $5$ is prime. (Theorem 5.23.)   
Now, since we have shown $\mathbb{Z}_5$ to be a field, it remains to show that the polynomial $x^2 +4x +1$ on $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is irreducible (Theorem 5.37.). To do this, we must prove that $x^2 +4x +1$ has no roots in $\mathbb{Z}_5$. 
Since
$$\mathbb{Z}_5 =\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$$
we do this:
$$
\begin{align}
&x= 0 \implies 0^2 + 4(0) + 1 \not\equiv_5 0 \\
&x = 1 \implies 1^2 + 4(1) + 1 \not\equiv_5 0 \\
&x= 2 \implies 2^2 + 4(2) + 1 \not\equiv_5 0 \\
&x= 3 \implies 3^2 + 4(3) + 1 \not\equiv_5 0 \\
&x= 4 \implies 4^2 + 4(4) + 1 \not\equiv_5 0 \\
\end{align}
$$
which concludes the proof, as the polynomial $x^2 + 4x + 1$ is congruent to zero over no element in the field $\mathbb{Z}$.

(b) Prove that $F^* = \langle x + 3 \rangle$

**Proof:**
To prove that $F^âˆ—=\langle x+3\rangle$, we need to show two things:


1. $F^* \subseteq \langle x + 3 \rangle$
Every nonzero element in $F$ can be represented as $a(x + 3) + b$, where $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_5$, and $a$ is not congruent to 0. This is because $x^2 + 4x + 1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$. Let $f(x) = a(x + 3) + b$ be an arbitrary nonzero element in $F^*$. We need to show that $f(x)$ can be generated by $\langle x + 3 \rangle$. Consider the polynomial $g(x) = x + 3$. Notice that $g(x)$ generates the ideal $\langle x + 3 \rangle$. Therefore, any multiple of $g(x)$ is in $\langle x + 3 \rangle$. Since $f(x)$ is a multiple of $g(x)$, we can conclude that $f(x) \in \langle x + 3 \rangle$, and thus, $F^* \subseteq \langle x + 3 \rangle$.


2. $\langle x + 3 \rangle \subseteq F^*$
Consider an arbitrary element $h(x) = c(x + 3)$ where $c \in \mathbb{Z}_5$ and $c$ is not congruent to 0. This element is in $\langle x + 3 \rangle$. Since $x^2 + 4x + 1$ is irreducible, $c(x + 3)$ is nonzero, and thus, $h(x) \in F^*$. This is because every nonzero element in $F$ can be expressed as $a(x + 3) + b$. Therefore, $\langle x + 3 \rangle \subseteq F^*$.


Combining both steps, we can conclude that $F^* = \langle x + 3 \rangle$, and we have shown that every nonzero element in $F$ can be generated by $\langle x + 3 \rangle$.
$\square$

(c) Write $a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 +(2x+1)y +1 \in F [y]$ as a  product of irreducible polynomials.
Hint: $2x + 1 \equiv_{x2+4x+1} 2(x + 3) \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.



deg(polynom) = 1 => irreduzibel



Let $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$

Write $a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 +(2x+1)y +1 \in F [y]$ as a  product of irreducible polynomials.
Hint: $2x + 1 \equiv_{x2+4x+1} 2(x + 3) \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.



Let \( F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1} \).

Write \( a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 + (2x+1)y + 1 \) in \( F[y] \) as a product of irreducible polynomials.

Hint: \( 2x + 1 \equiv_{x^2+4x+1} 2(x + 3) \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x] \).



The given polynomial is $a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 + (2x+1)y + 1$

Using the hint, we substitute $( 2x + 1 )$ with $( 2(x + 3) )$:

$a(y) = (2(x+3))y^2 + (2(x+3))y + 1$

Factoring out the common factor $( 2(x+3) )$:

$a(y) = 2(x+3)(y^2 + y) + 1$

Factoring the quadratic $( y^2 + y )$ over $\mathbb{Z}_5$:
\[ y^2 + y = y(y+1)$

Substituting this back into the expression:
\[ a(y) = 2(x+3)y(y+1) + 1 \]

So, the irreducible factorization of \( a(y) \) in \( F[y] \) is:
\[ a(y) = \left(2(x+3)\right) \cdot y \cdot (y+1) + 1 \]

The irreducible polynomials are \( 2(x+3) \), \( y \), and \( y+1 \).
