Let $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x2+4x+1}$



(a) Prove that $F$ is a field.

Theorem 5.23. 

___


(b) $F^* = \langle x + 3 \rangle$

$|F^*| = |F \backslash \{0\} | = 5^2 -1 =24$
...

___


(c) Write $a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 +(2x+1)y +1 \in F [y]$ as a  product of irreducible polynomials.
Hint: $2x + 1 \equiv_{x2+4x+1} 2(x + 3) \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.



deg(polynom) = 1 => irreduzibel
