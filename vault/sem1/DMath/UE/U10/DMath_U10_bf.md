Let $F = \mathbb{Z}_5[x]_{x^2+4x+1}$

(a) Prove that $F$ is a field.

**Proof:**
$\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a field, since $5$ is prime. (Theorem 5.23.)   
Now, since we have shown $\mathbb{Z}_5$ to be a field, it remains to show that the polynomial $x^2 +4x +1$ on $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is irreducible (Theorem 5.37.).

(b) $F^* = \langle x + 3 \rangle$

$|F^*| = |F \backslash \{0\} | = 5^2 -1 =24$

(c) Write $a(y) = (2x+3)y^2 +(2x+1)y +1 \in F [y]$ as a  product of irreducible polynomials.
Hint: $2x + 1 \equiv_{x2+4x+1} 2(x + 3) \in \mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.



deg(polynom) = 1 => irreduzibel
