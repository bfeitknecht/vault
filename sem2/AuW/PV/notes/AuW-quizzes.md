# This could be a title

## This is the front #card    
This is the back of the card.

This line will not be part of it, because there is an empty line above.

### This is a normal and reversed card #card-reverse
Which means that two cards will be generated on Anki.

### Also reverse #card/reverse
But this time it uses Obsidian hierarchical tags.

### This could be another question #card
But this time without the heading.

## This is another way to define the front
#card 
This style is usefull to avoid the hashtags when referencing in Obsidian


# This could be a title

All of these works:
My question::My answer
My question:: My answer
My question ::My Answer
My question :: My answer

You can even use it in lists:
- My question:: My answer



abc::abc
