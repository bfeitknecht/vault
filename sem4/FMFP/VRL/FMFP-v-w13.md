# Info


# Topics
- model checking
- [[non-deterministic finite state machine (NFSM)]] from transition system
- $\omega$-regular language
- b√ºchi automaton


# Notes
- safety property is regular if its bad prefixes are described by a regular language over the alphabet $\mathcal{P}(\mathrm{AP})$
- construct product automaton from NFSM for transition system and regular safety property to check for bad prefix
