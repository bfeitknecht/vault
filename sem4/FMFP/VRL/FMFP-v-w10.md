# Info


# Topics
- structural operational semantics
- configuration


# Notes
- big-step semantics describe how the overall results of the executions are obtained
- small-step semantics describe how the individual steps of the computations take place
- execution of a statement terminates successfully if there exists a state with finite derivation sequence
	- these are ==properties of configurations== $\langle s, \sigma \rangle$, not statements alone!
