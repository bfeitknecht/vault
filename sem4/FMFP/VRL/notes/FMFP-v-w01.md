### Introduction to FP
- does programming language make a difference in computation power? NO!
- in imperative language (Java, C, etc.) functions modify state, i.e. update memory
- imperative `gcd`, correctness proved with hoare logic (tedious)
- functional `gcd`, recursive description of a function, algorithm if function execution is specified
- functions compute valuesaa
- function have ==no side effects!== this is called **referential transparency**
- recursion instead of iteration, flexible type system
- eager evaluation, immediately evaluate arguments first (call by value)
- lazy evaluation, only evaluate arguments when needed (call by need)


### Lambda Calculus
theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluations


### Haskell
- like a calculator
- lazy evaluation
- indentation matters!
- strong type system
