### Introduction to FP
- does programming language make a difference in computation power? NO!
- in functional programming, functions compute values
- in imperative language (Java, C, etc.) functions modify state, i.e. update memory
- imperative `gcd`, correctness proved with hoare logic (tedious)
- functional `gcd`, recursive description of a function, algorithm if function execution is specified
- function have ==no side effects!== this is called **referential transparency**
- recursion instead of iteration, flexible type system


### Lambda Calculus
theoretical framework for describing functions and their evaluations
