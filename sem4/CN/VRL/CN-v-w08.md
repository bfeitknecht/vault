# Info
- "It's okay that it's not so great."


# Topics
- switches
- error detection
- error correction
- physical layer


# Notes
- in order to avoid possible endless packet forwards, switches build spanning tree of the network topology
- bit stuffing has better worst case overhead than byte stuffing but pretty much same average
