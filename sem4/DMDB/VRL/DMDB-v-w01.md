# Info
Data is very important. Databases manage data as an abstraction for the programmer.

# Topics
- programming language `SQL`
- DBMS


# Notes
Implementation of`SQL` is not consistent across database providers.

DBMS avoids redundancy and inconsistency, facilitates synchronized access, etc. Declarative language says, how to make it! Traditional programming languages are imperative (tell computer what to do). Persistency and consistency are the attractive strong guarantees of DB.
