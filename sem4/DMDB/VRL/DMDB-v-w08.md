# Info
- interactive SQL session 02.06.25, BYOD (not exam relevant)


# Topics
- k-means
- clustering
- classification
- hashing
- hash table

# Notes
- notion of cluster can be ambiguous
- partitional clustering, every element is in exactly one cluster
- hierarchical clustering, nested clusters organized into hierarchy
- k-means clustering, define clusters based on minimal euclidian distance to centroids
- classification is learning target function that maps attribute set to a label
- locality sensitive hashing (LSH) divides data space into hyperplanes and assigns corresponding attribute bit
- treating database as vector space enables enhanced performance because of proximity approximation
