# joint distribution
The **joint distribution** of $n$ discrete [[random variable|random variables]] with $X_{i} \in W_{i}. \Pr[X_{i}] = 1$ for some $W_{i} \subset \mathbb{R}$ *finite* or *countable* is the collection $p = (p(x_{1}, \dots x_{n}))_{x_{i}\in W_{i}}$, where $p(x_{1}, \dots x_{n}) = \Pr[X_{1}=x_{1}, \dots X_{n} = x_{n}]$.


# likelihood
The **likelihood function** on a [[probability space]] $\Omega$ with parameter space $\Theta$ is defined in terms of the [[joint distribution]], based on the space's atomicity.
