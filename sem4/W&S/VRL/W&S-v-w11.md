- gamma function
- chi distribution
- t-distribution
- normal model


# Notes
- $\{ X_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\}_{m} \implies |(X_{i})_{m}| \sim \chi_{m}$, for a family of $m$ normal distributions, the length of the combined vector exhibits chi distribution in $m$
- $\frac{\chi_{m}}{\sqrt{ m }} \overset{m}{\to} 1$, as the number of dimensions in chi distribution increases, the normalized vector length approaches one
- let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $Y \sim \chi^{2}_{m}$ be independent, then $Z = \frac{X}{\sqrt{ \frac{Y}{m} }} \sim t_{m}$, i.e. as the number of dimension increases, the t-distribution converges to a normal distribution
