This video is great if you’d like to take a look at how BGP works in real life. IT takes a look at the recent Facebook outage and explains how it happened. Question 1: OSI Layers, IP, DHCP, ARP Question 1.1 A packet (i.e., a sequence of bytes sent over a network) is called differently depending on which OSI layer is occurs. Fill in the following table with the corresponding entries from the following list (note that some terms may be used in multiple layers and some terms may not be used at all): • netpacket • dataframe • segment • frame • datagram • message layer name of respective packet Application Transport (TCP) Transport (UDP) Network Datagram, Packet Link Physical This layer moves single bits so there is no notion of a packet Question 1.2 Which of the following informations are contained inside of the IPv4 header: • Sequence number • NAT translation table • TTL (time to live) • The DNS A-record for the corresponding hostname • checksum • used Transport protocol (TCP, UDP,. . . ) Question 1.3 What does the acronym DHCP stand for and what is its purpose? 1 • Dynamic host congestion protocol - is used to handle congestion issues • Dynamic host configuration protocol - is used to set IP configurations • Dynamic hamster cuddle protocol - is used to cuddle your favorite pet Question 1.4 How does a machine connected to a LAN learn about its own MAC address? Question 1.5 How does a machine connected to a LAN learn about the MAC addresses of other machines in the same LAN? Question 2: Distance-Vector Routing 2.1 Counting to Infinity In the Figure below, after the network is already stabilized, the link connecting nodes C and D breaks. 1. Show how nodes A, B and C might experience the count-to-infinity phe- nomenon for their distances to node D. Show at least two updates in the DV algorithm. For each of these updates, specify the distance-to-D that each node advertised to the neighbors. 2. Will the problem be resolved after some iterations? 2 Network Topology Question 3: Link-State Routing Your company just bought and installed some routers to create their own internal network. You are trying to set up the routing system so that the routers forward packets efficiently. You decide to use a Link-State routing protocol. Question 3.1 What are the two basic steps in each LS routing algorithm? Briefly explain. Question 3.2 All links in your network have a specific propagation delay and bandwidth. A reduced model of the network is given below. Each link is described by the tuple (X,Y) where X is the propagation delay in ms and Y is the Bandwidth in Mbps. However, we cannot run Dijkstra on tuples! 3 Network Model As you can see in the topology, D has dedicated low latency but low bandwidth links to all other nodes in the network, while there are high bandwidth but high latency links between the routers A, B, and C. Let’s assume you care about minimizing latency. Draw the sink tree of the network for router A (A is the sink) only considering the latency metric. Question 3.3 Assume you implement LS-Routing considering only the latency metric. 1. Will this always minimize the experienced latency in practice (i.e., consid- ering some traffic being sent through the network)? 2. What could be an issue there? Question 3.4 Propose a new routing metric to reduce the experienced latency in this case. 4","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
