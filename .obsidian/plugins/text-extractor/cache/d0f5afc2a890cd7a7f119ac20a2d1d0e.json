Question 2: Sliding window 1. A sliding window is used in a transport protocol to enable high throughput. Part of such a transport protocol is to negotiate the sender window size and receiver window size. Why is it a desirable property that sender window <= receiver window? 2. Consider the sliding window shown. This sliding window uses packets as its smallest, indivisible unit. The sliding window is maintained using two integer variables: SND.UNA, which is the lowest packet sequence number which is not acknowledged, and SND.NXT, which is the lowest packet sequence number that has not yet been sent out. Answer the following questions (without accounting for sequence number wrap-around) A sender sliding window. Operating Systems & Networks (252-0062-00L); Spring Semester 2019, Question 3c 1. What is the current window size (in other words, how many data packets are outstanding in the network)? 1. SND.NXT 2. SND.UNA 3. SND.NXT − SND.UNA 4. SND.UNA − SND.NXT 2. Let MAXWND be the maximum window size. Which invariant must hold? 1. SND.NXT ≤ SND.UNA + MAXWND 2. SND.NXT ≥ SND.UNA + MAXWND 3. SND.NXT ≤ MAXWND 4. SND.NXT ≥ MAXWND 1 Question 3: AIMD In this exercise, there are two machines, each having one flow going over the same link. Both machines use additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) to control their rates. Assume that the decreasing line (negative derivative) intersects the axes at a value for throughput that fully utilizes the link with the respective machine. 1. Label the two perpendicular lines that are drawn inside the graph (not the axes). 2. Point A shows the current bandwidth of machines 1 and 2. Which machine is using more bandwidth, and is the link saturated? 3. Following AIMD, draw the vector resulting from point A until the state of the algorithm changes. Do this one more time. Explain your reasoning. 4. Will AIMD convergence to fair sharing in this case? Fair sharing Question 4:MIAD In this exercise, there are two machines, each having one flow going over the same link. Both machines use multiplitive increase additive decrease (MIAD) to control their rates. 1. Following MIAD, draw the vector resulting from point A until the state of the algorithm changes. Do this one more time. Explain your reasoning. 2. Will MIAD converge to fair sharing in this case? What will happen? 3. If you compare the result of AIMD against MIAD, which one would be better in a real life application 2 Unfair sharing Question 5: Congestion signals (Previous Exam Question [1]) List three signals that warn about congestion in the network, and mention one advantage and one disadvantage of using each signal. [1] Operating Systems & Networks (252-0062-00L); Spring Semester 2016 (FS16). Question 9a. Question 6: Reliable transport protocol 1. Name five undesirable effects the network can have on individual pack- ets and/or a stream of packets when attempting to deliver them to the destination. 2. What are the four goals of reliable transfer? Describe them shortly. 3. What mechanism is used to detect corrupted packets in TCP/UDP? Shortly explain. 4. You already know that packets can get duplicated by the network i.e., multiple identical packets can arrive at the receiver. How would a reliable transport protocol detect duplicated packets? Question 7: Timeouts 1. In reliable transmission, what is the effect of setting a too short timeout, and conversely, what is the effect of setting a too long timeout? 2. RTT is a higher-level network property that is mainly used to decide what the re-transmission timeout should be set to. Which four network delays determine the RTT? 3 3. Of these four network delays, what changes in the network can you do (if any) to reduce the RTT? 4. When a timeout is triggered in the sender, can the sender be sure that the receiver has really not received the packet? If yes, how? Question 8: Go-Back-N You can find a nice animation of Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat here. For each of the following statements indicate for each if it is true or false. 1. Go-Back-N acknowledges only the last in-order packet it has received. 2. Go-Back-N senders maintain a timer for each packet sent out. 3. If a Go-Back-N receiver receives an out-of-order packet, it is possible to move the sliding receiver window along. 4","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
