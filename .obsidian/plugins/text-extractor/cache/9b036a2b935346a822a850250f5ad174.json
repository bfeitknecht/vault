You think about changing all the Internet to circuit-switching (instead of packet-switching). 1. Which application would mostly benefit from this change? Which wont? 2. You know from external sources that most of the transmitted traffic is video streaming. Would circuit switching be more beneficial in this case? 3. Can you think of applications that could benefit from a mixed (circuit and packet-switching) approach? Question 2: Cloud Services Making use of cloud services instead of own networking infrastructure has become increasingly popular, especially among small- to medium-sized companies not in the IT field (i.e., a company selling items online). Which problems would such a company have to face when trying to use their own infrastructure. Think about (a) handling peak usage, (b) providing global quality of service, and (c) maintenance. How do cloud services ameliorate these issues? Question 3. Provisioning Assume that N users share the same up-link to their Internet Service Provider. The link capacity is C Mbps. When online, a user will require U Mbps bandwidth. The probability of a user being online at any point in time is Ponline independent of other users. Question 3.1 In closed form, what is the probability Pinadequate that there is not enough available link capacity to fully satisfy the needs of the online users? Hint: Say X is the amount of users online. Think about the distribution of X Question 3.2 For N=5 users, C=20 Mbps, U=7 Mbps, and Ponline = 0.3: what is is the probability Pinadequate of the link being inadequate? Hint: You might use some of these values: Binomial probabilities Bin(i = 1;P = 0.3 , N = 5) = 0.36015 Bin(i = 2;P = 0.3 , N = 5) = 0.3087 Bin(i = 3;P = 0.3 , N = 5) = 0.1323 Bin(i = 4;P = 0.3 , N = 5) = 0.02835 1 Binomial probabilities Bin(i = 5;P = 0.3 , N = 5) = 0.00243 Question 3.3 Assume you are a network engineer at the Internet Service provider. Using a link with smaller capacity C is way cheaper and profitable for your company. You can probably get away without provisioning for peak usage (having enough bandwidth to handle all users at the same time, i.e. C = N · U ). However you want to keep the risk of the link being inadequate Pinadequate smaller than Pmax.risk. Given (N, U, Ponline, Pmax.risk) we want to know: what is the minimum C such that Pinadequate ≤ Pmax.risk? Complete the algorithm below that computes the minimum C: Algorithm template Question 3.4 (optional) Implement the algorithm of Q3.3 in a language of your choosing. For N = 130 users, U = 4 Mbps, and Ponline = 0.2: what is the minimum link capacity Cmin needed such that Pinadequate ≤ 0.01? Question 4: Queuing delay Suppose N packets are enqueued at a interface at the same time. Upon arrival of the packets, the queue is empty, and nothing is being transmitted currently. All packets are of size S and the transmission rate of the link is R. 1. What is the queueing delay for the first packet? 2. What is the queueing delay for the n-th packet? 3. What is the average queuing delay for the N packets? Question 5: Throughput in a Network In this exercise you will calculate the throughput in a network and the time it takes to send a file over this network. We will neglect any sort of delay and focus 2 solely on the transmission rates of links. We will further assume that the server and the client in the picture below are the only ones communicating on the network and therefore congestion (and therefore packet loss) is also irrelevant. Maximum flow answer template 1. The diagram below shows the capacities for each link in Mbps. Compute the throughput of this network also in Mbps. 2. Assuming this network is much larger and more complex, is there a way to systematically compute the throughput? 3. Given a file F of size 19 million bits. How long does it take to transmit the whole file (again, neglecting any delay except for transmission delay)? Question 6: DSL Still today many homes use a DSL connection to connect to the internet. 1. Short Questions: • Which infrastructure does DSL use? 1. television infrastructure 2. telephone infrastructure 3. its own infrastructure 4. other • Is the DSL connection symmetric (i.e., the upload and download stream have different bandwidths)? If not, briefly explain why. 1. Yes 2. No. The download connection has higher bandwidth 3. No. The upload connection has higher bandwidth 2. Assume you are running a business that provides a content service to your customers over the internet. Is making use of a DSL connection a good idea? Why or why not? 3 3. In recent years, fiber optic connections to the home (FTTH) have gained in popularity. FTTH can deliver up to Gbps rates. Name two reasons why this technology has not become the most prevalent yet. Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate: Assume a client transmits data with the following transmission rate over time. Give all results with respect to m and k Transmission rate over time 1. What is the peak rate P ? 2. What is the average rate A ? 3. Assume circuit switching. In order to transmit all of the data correctly without delays. What is the minimal bandwidth R that must be reserved? 4. What is the utilization of this connection? Hint: The utilization is defined as A/R 5. Given that the P/A is large (≫ 1). Which approach gives better perfor- mance?: • packet switching • circuit switching • both give the same performance 4","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
