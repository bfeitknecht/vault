With virtual sensing, each station keeps a logical record of when the channel is in use by tracking the NAV (Network Allocation Vector). Each frame carries a NAV field that specifies how long the sequence to which the frame belongs will take to complete. Note: The lecture states that nodes only wait after receiving a CTS. Node C reserved a NAV upon receiving a RTS which is the effect of an optimization in the implementation: Upon receiving an RTS the node waits for a potential following CTS finally reserving the whole transmission time if a CTS is received. In practice there are many more optimizations like this. Question 1.1 Can you say something about the distance of the stations from A? Is station C or D closer? Briefly explain. Question 1.2 Assume there are 4 wireless stations in a straight line, A through D, communi- cating using the Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA) protocol, as shown below. Every station is only in the range of its neighbors and vice versa. 1 Stations A-D in a straight line • Is it possible for two transmissions to take place simultaneously? Briefly explain. • What is the minimum number of stations in this scenario for two transmis- sions to take place simultaneously? Question 1.3 Now assume CSMA/CD (not CSMA/CA) for a wired network. If signal prop- agation speed in twin lead is 2.46 · 108 m/s and signal propagation speed in multimode fiber is 1.95 · 108 m/s, a) What is the minimum time a node must transmit such that to be sure that no other node started transmission without sensing its message for a 2 km twin-lead cable? b) What is the minimum time a node must transmit such that to be sure that no other node started transmission without sensing its message for a 40 km multimode fiber optic cable? Question 2: Wireless The following topology consists of 6 wireless nodes, A through F, illustrated by the corresponding dots: The circle around each node illustrates its transmission range. For example, A’s transmission area is shown by the shaded circle, and it cannot reach F. The transmissions of two nodes interfere if and only if they transmit at the same time and their transmission areas overlap. Question 2.1 For the transmission from A to B, list the potential hidden terminals from A and the exposed terminals. Question 2.2 Assume you are using an RTS/CTS protocol to reduce the hidden/exposed terminal problems. a) Explain what prevents a hidden terminal from interfering with a sender. 2 Figure 2: Network topology b) Explain how a terminal infers that it is exposed and can thus send to another destination. c) An exposed terminal in an RTS/CTS protocol may still be unsuccessful in sending. Explain how this is possible. 3","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
