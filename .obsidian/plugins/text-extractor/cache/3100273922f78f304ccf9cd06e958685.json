Thus we define an indicator variable for every edge e. Ye = { For every edge e the chance that the vertices are in dif ferent subsets (S, V ∖ S) is the chance that the second vertex is in a dif ferent vertex than the first one. Which is 1 2 as all subsets are equally likely . ∀e ∈ E : E[Ye] = 1 2 E[X] linearity of E = ∑e∈E E[Ye] = m ⋅ 1 2 = m 2 (b) For the weighted average to be m 2 there has to exist at least one value with magnitude at least m 2 . (→ Lecture) 2 P r[A|B] = P r[A∩B] P r[B] = P r[A] (i) To show that ¯A and B are independent it suffices to show that P r[ ¯A|B] = P r[ ¯A]. This proves the independence of ¯A and B (ii) Simply by swapping A and B we can show this independence analogous to (i). (iii) 1, e is an edge over (S, V ∖ S) 0, otherwise P r[ ¯A|B] = P r[ ¯A ∩ B] P r[B] (def. conditional prob.) = P r[B] − P r[A ∩ B] P r[B] (law of total prob. over B) = 1 − P r[A ∩ B] P r[B] = 1 − P r[A|B] (def. conditional prob.) = 1 − P r[A] (independence A and B) = P r[ ¯A] (def. of complement)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
