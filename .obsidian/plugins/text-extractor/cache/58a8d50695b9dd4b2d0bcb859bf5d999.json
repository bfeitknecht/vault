It is not sufficient to only give a number or a formula. • We recommend that you work on the exercises in small groups of up to three students and hand in one joint solution. Please legibly indicate your names, student numbers, and the exercise group (the weekday and room of the group or the name of the teaching assistant) on your solution sheets. • New exercise sheets and solutions are made available after the lecture on Friday on Moodle (https://moodle-app2.let.ethz.ch/course/view.php?id=23497). Task 1 (a) Let n ∈ N − {0}. How many words of length n over the alphabet Σ = {a, b, c} are there that contain each of the three letters at least once? (b) We consider the alphabet Σ = {0, 1} and a natural number n ∈ N. Determine the number of words from Σn that do not contain 11 as a subword. 10 points Task 2 Prove or disprove the following statements: (a) For every language L it holds that L 2 ⊆ L =⇒ L = ∅ or L = {λ} or L is infinite. (b) For arbitrary languages L1 and L2 it holds that L2 · (L2 − L1) = (L2)2 − L2 · L1. 10 points (please turn over) Task 3 Let k, l ∈ N − {0}. For each of the subtasks, give an alphabet Σ and two languages L1 and L2 over Σ satisfying the respective conditions. (a) |L1| = k and |L1L2| = k + 1, (b) |L1| = k and |L1L2| = k + 5, (c) |L1| = k, |L2| = l, and |L1L2| = k · l, (d) |L1| = k, |L2| = l, |Σ| = 1, and |L1L2| = k · l. 10 points Submission: On Friday, September 27, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
