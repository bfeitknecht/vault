(Qv) ⊤(Qw)= v⊤w ⟹ Q⊤ = Q−1 Assume the LHS of the implication for arbitrary vectors v, w ∈ Rm and square matrix Q ∈ Rm×m. Then rewrite (Qv)⊤(Qw) as v⊤Q⊤Qw, by deﬁnition of transpose and per associativity. Now we have v⊤Q⊤Qw = v⊤w. This implies that the innermost inner product must be equal to the m × m identity matrix, i.e. Q⊤Q = Im. It follows that Q⊤ = Q−1, the deﬁnition of an orthogonal matrix. Thus we have proven the statement above. □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
