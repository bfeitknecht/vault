 We want both fast and large  But, we cannot achieve both with a single level of memory  Idea: Have multiple levels of storage (progressively bigger and slower as the levels are farther from the processor) and ensure most of the data the processor needs is kept in the fast(er) level(s) 17 The Memory Hierarchy 18 fast small large but slow move what you use here back up everything here With good locality of reference, memory appears as fast as and as large asfaster per bytecheaper per byte Memory Hierarchy  Fundamental tradeoff  Fast memory: small  Large memory: slow  Idea: Memory hierarchy  Latency, cost, size, bandwidth 19 CPU Main Memory (DRAM)RF Cache Hard Disk Memory Hierarchy Example 20 Kim & Mutlu, “Memory Systems,” Computing Handbook, 2014 https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/memory-systems-introduction_computing-handbook14.pdf Locality  One’s recent past is a very good predictor of their near future  Temporal Locality: If you just did something, it is very likely that you will do the same thing again soon  since you are here today, there is a good chance you will be here again and again regularly  Spatial Locality: If you did something, it is very likely you will do something similar/related (in space)  every time I find you in this room, you are probably sitting close to the same people AND/OR in closeby seats 21 Memory Locality  A “typical” program has a lot of locality in memory references  typical programs are composed of “loops”  Temporal: A program tends to reference the same memory location many times and all within a small window of time  Spatial: A program tends to reference nearby memory locations within a window of time  most notable examples: 1. instruction memory references  mostly sequential/streaming 2. references to arrays/vectors  often streaming/strided 22 Caching Basics: Exploit Temporal Locality  Idea: Store recently accessed data in automatically-managed fast memory (called cache)  Anticipation: same mem. location will be accessed again soon  Temporal locality principle  Recently accessed data will be again accessed in the near future  This is what Maurice Wilkes had in mind:  Wilkes, “Slave Memories and Dynamic Storage Allocation,” IEEE Trans. On Electronic Computers, 1965.  “The use is discussed of a fast core memory of, say 32000 words as a slave to a slower core memory of, say, one million words in such a way that in practical cases the effective access time is nearer that of the fast memory than that of the slow memory.” 23 Caching Basics: Exploit Spatial Locality  Idea: Store data in addresses adjacent to the recently accessed one in automatically-managed fast memory  Logically divide memory into equal-size blocks  Fetch to cache the accessed block in its entirety  Anticipation: nearby memory locations will be accessed soon  Spatial locality principle  Nearby data in memory will be accessed in the near future  E.g., sequential instruction access, array traversal  This is what IBM 360/85 implemented  16 Kbyte cache with 64 byte blocks  Liptay, “Structural aspects of the System/360 Model 85 II: the cache,” IBM Systems Journal, 1968. 24 The Bookshelf Analogy  Book in your hand  Desk  Bookshelf  Boxes at home  Boxes in storage  Recently-used books tend to stay on desk  Comp Arch books, books for classes you are currently taking  Until the desk gets full  Adjacent books in the shelf needed around the same time  If I have organized/categorized my books well in the shelf 25 Caching in a Pipelined Design  The cache needs to be tightly integrated into the pipeline  Ideally, access in 1-cycle so that load-dependent operations do not stall  High frequency pipeline  Cannot make the cache large  But, we want a large cache AND a pipelined design  Idea: Cache hierarchy 26 CPU Main Memory (DRAM) RF Level1 Cache Level 2 Cache A Note on Manual vs. Automatic Management  Manual: Programmer manages data movement across levels -- too painful for programmers on substantial programs  “core” vs “drum” memory in the 1950s  done in embedded processors (on-chip scratchpad SRAM in lieu of a cache), GPUs (called “shared memory”), ML accelerators, …  Automatic: Hardware manages data movement across levels, transparently to the programmer ++ programmer’s life is easier  the average programmer doesn’t need to know about caches  You don’t need to know how big the cache is and how it works to write a “correct” program!

On Electronic Computers, 1965.  “By a slave memory I mean one which automatically accumulates to itself words that come from a slower main memory, and keeps them available for subsequent use without it being necessary for the penalty of main memory access to be incurred again.” 36 Historical Aside: Other Cache Papers  Fotheringham, “Dynamic Storage Allocation in the Atlas Computer, Including an Automatic Use of a Backing Store,” CACM 1961.  http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=366800  Bloom, Cohen, Porter, “Considerations in the Design of a Computer with High Logic-to-Memory Speed Ratio,” AIEE Gigacycle Computing Systems Winter Meeting, Jan. 1962. 37 Cache in 1962 (Bloom, Cohen, Porter) 38 Tag Store Data Store A Modern Memory Hierarchy 39 Register File 32 words, sub-nsec L1 cache ~10s of KB, ~nsec L2 cache 100s of KB ~ few MB, many nsec L3 cache, many MBs, even more nsec Main memory (DRAM), Many GBs, ~100 nsec Swap Disk ~100 GB or few TB, ~10s of usec-msec manual/compiler register spilling automatic demand paging automatic HW cache management Memory Abstraction Hierarchical Latency Analysis  A given memory hierarchy level i has intrinsic access time of ti  It also has perceived access time Ti that is longer than ti  Except for the outer-most hierarchy level, when looking for a given address there is  a chance (hit-rate hi) you “hit” and access time is ti  a chance (miss-rate mi) you “miss” and access time ti +Ti+1  hi + mi = 1  Thus Ti = hi·ti + mi·(ti + Ti+1) Ti = ti + mi ·Ti+1 hi and mi are defined to be the hit-rate and miss-rate of only the references that missed at Li-1 40 Hierarchy Design Considerations  Recursive latency equation Ti = ti + mi ·Ti+1  The goal: achieve desired T1 within allowed cost  Ti  ti is desirable  Keep mi low  increasing capacity Ci lowers mi, but beware of increasing ti  lower mi by smarter cache management (replacement::anticipate what you don’t need, prefetching::anticipate what you will need)  Keep Ti+1 low  faster outer hierarchy levels can help, but beware of increasing cost  introduce intermediate hierarchy levels as a compromise 41 Intel Pentium 4 Example Boggs et al., “The Microarchitecture of the Pentium 4 Processor,” Intel Technology Journal, 2004.

Subblocks?  Write policy: what do we do about writes?  Instructions/data: do we treat them separately? 50 Cache Abstraction and Metrics  Cache hit rate = (# hits) / (# hits + # misses) = (# hits) / (# accesses)  Average memory access time (AMAT) = ( hit-rate * hit-latency ) + ( miss-rate * miss-latency )  Important Aside: Is reducing AMAT always beneficial for performance? 51 Address Tag Store (is the address in the cache? + bookkeeping) Data Store (stores memory blocks) Hit/miss? Data A Basic Hardware Cache Design  We will start with a basic hardware cache design  Then, we will examine a multitude of ideas to make it better (i.e., higher performance) 52 Blocks and Addressing the Cache  Main memory logically divided into fixed-size chunks (blocks)  Cache can house only a limited number of blocks 53 Blocks and Addressing the Cache  Main memory logically divided into fixed-size chunks (blocks)  Cache can house only a limited number of blocks  Each block address maps to a potential location in the cache, determined by the index bits in the address  used to index into the tag and data stores  Cache access: 1) index into the tag and data stores with index bits in address 2) check valid bit in tag store 3) compare tag bits in address with the stored tag in tag store  If the stored tag is valid and matches the tag of the block, then the block is in the cache (cache hit) 54 8-bit address tag index byte in block 3 bits3 bits2b Let’s See A Toy Example  We will examine a direct-mapped cache first  Direct-mapped: A given main memory block can be placed in only one possible location in the cache  Toy example: 256-byte memory, 64-byte cache, 8-byte blocks 55Kim & Mutlu, “Memory Systems,” Computing Handbook, 2014 Direct-Mapped Cache: Placement and Access  Assume byte-addressable main memory: 256 bytes, 8-byte blocks  32 blocks in mem  Assume cache: 64 bytes, 8 blocks  Direct-mapped: A block can go to only one location  Blocks with same index contend for the same cache location  Cause conflict misses when accessed consecutively 56 Tag store Data store Address tag index byte in block 3 bits3 bits2b V tag =? MUX byte in block Hit? Data Block: 00000 Block: 00001 Block: 00010 Block: 00011 Block: 00100 Block: 00101 Block: 00110 Block: 00111 Block: 01000 Block: 01001 Block: 01010 Block: 01011 Block: 01100 Block: 01101 Block: 01110 Block: 01111 Block: 10000 Block: 10001 Block: 10010 Block: 10011 Block: 10100 Block: 10101 Block: 10110 Block: 10111 Block: 11000 Block: 11001 Block: 11010 Block: 11011 Block: 11100 Block: 11101 Block: 11110 Block: 11111 Main memory Direct-Mapped Caches  Direct-mapped cache: Two blocks in memory that map to the same index in the cache cannot be present in the cache at the same time  One index  one entry  Can lead to 0% hit rate if more than one block accessed in an interleaved manner map to the same index  Assume addresses A and B have the same index bits but different tag bits  A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, …  conflict in the cache index  All accesses are conflict misses 57  Problem: Addresses N and N+8 always conflict in direct mapped cache  Idea: enable blocks with the same index to map to > 1 cache location  Example: Instead of having one column of 8, have 2 columns of 4 blocks Set Associativity Tag store Data store V tag =? V tag =? Address tag index byte in block 3 bits2 bits3 bits Logic MUX MUX byte in block Key idea: Associative memory within the set + Accommodates conflicts better (fewer conflict misses) -- More complex, slower access, larger tag store SET Hit? 2-way set associative cache: Blocks with the same index can map to 2 locations Higher Associativity  4-way + Likelihood of conflict misses even lower -- More tag comparators and wider data mux; larger tag store Tag store Data store =?=? =?=? MUX MUX byte in block Logic Hit? Address tag index byte in block 3 bits1 b4 bits 4-way set associative cache: Blocks with the same index can map to 4 locations Full Associativity  Fully associative cache  A block can be placed in any cache location Tag store Data store =? =? =? =? =? =? =? =? MUX MUX byte in block Logic Hit? Address tag byte in block 3 bits5 bits Fully associative cache: Any block can map to any location in the cache Associativity (and Tradeoffs)  Degree of associativity: How many blocks can map to the same index (or set)?  Higher associativity ++ Higher hit rate -- Slower cache access time (hit latency and data access latency) -- More expensive hardware (more comparators)  Diminishing returns from higher associativity 61 associativity hit rate Issues in Set-Associative Caches  Think of each block in a set having a “priority”  Indicating how important it is to keep the block in the cache  Key issue: How do you determine/adjust block priorities?  There are three key decisions in a set:  Insertion, promotion, eviction (replacement)  Insertion: What happens to priorities on a cache fill?  Where to insert the incoming block; whether or not to insert the block  Promotion: What happens to priorities on a cache hit?  Whether and how to change block priority  Eviction/replacement: What happens to priorities on a cache miss?  Which block to evict and how to adjust priorities 62 Eviction/Replacement Policy  Which block in the set to replace on a cache miss?  Any invalid block first  If all are valid, consult the replacement policy  Random  FIFO  Least recently used (how to implement?)  Not most recently used  Least frequently used?  Least costly to re-fetch?  Why would memory accesses have different cost?  Hybrid replacement policies  Optimal replacement policy? 63 Implementing LRU  Idea: Evict the least recently accessed block  Problem: Need to keep track of access order of blocks  Question: 2-way set associative cache:  What do you minimally need to implement LRU perfectly?  Question: 4-way set associative cache:  What do you minimally need to implement LRU perfectly?  How many different access orders are possible for the 4 blocks in the set?  How many bits needed to encode the LRU order of a block?  What is the logic needed to determine the LRU victim?  Repeat for N-way set associative cache 64 Approximations of LRU  Most modern processors do not implement “true LRU” (also called “perfect LRU”) in highly-associative caches  Why?  True LRU is complex  LRU is an approximation to predict locality anyway (i.e., not the best possible cache management policy)  Examples:  Not MRU (not most recently used)  Hierarchical LRU: divide the N-way set into M “groups”, track the MRU group and the MRU way in each group  Victim-NextVictim Replacement: Only keep track of the victim and the next victim 65 Cache Replacement Policy: LRU or Random  LRU vs. Random: Which one is better?  Example: 4-way cache, cyclic references to A, B, C, D, E  0% hit rate with LRU policy  Set thrashing: When the “program working set” in a set is larger than set associativity  Random replacement policy is better when thrashing occurs  In practice:  Performance of replacement policy depends on workload  Average hit rate of LRU and Random are similar  Best of both Worlds: Hybrid of LRU and Random  How to choose between the two? Set sampling  See Qureshi et al., ”A Case for MLP-Aware Cache Replacement,” ISCA 2006. 66 What Is the Optimal Replacement Policy?  Belady’s OPT  Replace the block that is going to be referenced furthest in the future by the program  Belady, “A study of replacement algorithms for a virtual-storage computer,” IBM Systems Journal, 1966.  How do we implement this? Simulate?  Is this optimal for minimizing miss rate?  Is this optimal for minimizing execution time?  No. Cache miss latency/cost varies from block to block!  Two reasons: Where miss is serviced from and miss overlapping  Qureshi et al. “A Case for MLP-Aware Cache Replacement,\" ISCA 2006. 67 Recommended Reading  Key observation: Some misses more costly than others as their latency is exposed as stall time. Reducing miss rate is not always good for performance. Cache replacement should take into account cost of misses.  Moinuddin K. Qureshi, Daniel N. Lynch, Onur Mutlu, and Yale N.

Slides (ppt) 68 What’s In A Tag Store Entry?  Valid bit  Tag  Replacement policy bits  Dirty bit?  Write back vs. write through caches 69 Handling Writes (I)  When do we write the modified data in a cache to the next level?  Write through: At the time the write happens  Write back: When the block is evicted  Write-back cache + Can combine multiple writes to the same block before eviction  Potentially saves bandwidth between cache levels + saves energy -- Need a bit in the tag store indicating the block is “dirty/modified”  Write-through cache + Simpler design + All levels are up to date & consistent  Simpler cache coherence: no need to check close-to-processor caches’ tag stores for presence -- More bandwidth intensive; no combining of writes 70 Handling Writes (II)  Do we allocate a cache block on a write miss?  Allocate on write miss: Yes  No-allocate on write miss: No  Allocate on write miss + Can combine writes instead of writing each individually to next level + Simpler because write misses can be treated the same way as read misses -- Requires transfer of the whole cache block  No-allocate + Conserves cache space if locality of written blocks is low (potentially better cache hit rate) 71 Handling Writes (III)  What if the processor writes to an entire block over a small amount of time?  Is there any need to bring the block into the cache from memory in the first place?  Why do we not simply write to only a portion of the block, i.e., subblock?  E.g., 4 bytes out of 64 bytes  Problem: Valid and dirty bits are associated with the entire 64 bytes, not with each individual 4 bytes 72 Subblocked (Sectored) Caches  Idea: Divide a block into subblocks (or sectors)  Have separate valid and dirty bits for each subblock (sector)  Allocate only a subblock (or a subset of subblocks) on a request ++ No need to transfer the entire cache block into the cache (A write simply validates and updates a subblock) ++ More freedom in transferring subblocks into the cache (a cache block does not need to be in the cache fully) (How many subblocks do you transfer on a read?) -- More complex design; more valid and dirty bits -- May not exploit spatial locality fully 73 tagsubblockvsubblockv subblockvd d d Instruction vs. Data Caches  Separate or Unified?  Pros and Cons of Unified: + Dynamic sharing of cache space  better overall cache utilization: no overprovisioning that might happen with static partitioning of cache space (i.e., separate I and D caches) -- Instructions and data can evict/thrash each other (i.e., no guaranteed space for either) -- I and D are accessed in different places in the pipeline. Where do we place the unified cache for fast access?  First level caches are almost always split  Mainly for the last reason above – pipeline constraints  Outer level caches are almost always unified 74 Multi-level Cache Design & Management  Cache level greatly affects cache design & management  First-level caches (instruction and data)  Decisions very much affected by cycle time & pipeline structure  Small, lower associativity; latency is critical  Tag store and data store are usually accessed in parallel  Second-level caches  Decisions need to balance hit rate and access latency  Usually large and highly associative; latency not as important  Tag store and data store can be accessed serially  Further-level (larger) caches  Access energy is a larger problem due to cache sizes  Tag store and data store are usually accessed serially 75 Serial vs. Parallel Access of Cache Levels  Parallel: Next level cache accessed in parallel with the previous level  a form of speculative access + Faster access to data if previous level misses -- Unnecessary accesses to next level if previous level hits  Serial: Next level cache accessed only if previous-level misses -- Slower access to data if previous level misses + No wasted accesses to next level if previous level hits  Next level does not see the same accesses as the previous  Previous level acts as a filter (filters some temporal & spatial locality)  Management policies are different across cache levels 76 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 77Source: https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested Apple M1, 2021 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 78Source: https://twitter.com/Locuza_/status/1454152714930331652 Intel Alder Lake, 2021 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 79https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-zen-3-vermeer-undressed-high-res-die-shots-close-ups-pictured-detailed/ AMD Ryzen 5000, 2020 Core Count: 8 cores/16 threads L1 Caches: 32 KB per core L2 Caches: 512 KB per core L3 Cache: 32 MB shared AMD’s 3D Last Level Cache (2021) 80https://youtu.be/gqAYMx34euU https://www.tech-critter.com/amd-keynote-computex-2021/ https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/5 134/comparing-zen-3-to-zen-2 Additional 64 MB L3 cache die stacked on top of the processor die - Connected using Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) - Total of 96 MB L3 cache AMD increases the L3 size of their 8-core Zen 3 processors from 32 MB to 96 MB Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 81https://www.it-techblog.de/ibm-power10-prozessor-mehr-speicher-mehr-tempo-mehr-sicherheit/09/2020/ IBM POWER10, 2020 Cores: 15-16 cores, 8 threads/core L2 Caches: 2 MB per core L3 Cache: 120 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 82https://www.tomshardware.com/news/infrared-photographer-photos-nvidia-ga102-ampere-silicon Nvidia Ampere, 2020 Cores: 128 Streaming Multiprocessors L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 192KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad L2 Cache: 40 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 83https://wccftech.com/nvidia-hopper-gpus-featuring-mcm-technology-tape-out-soon-rumor/ Nvidia Hopper, 2022 L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 256KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad Cores: 144 Streaming Multiprocessors L2 Cache: 60 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 84https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/ Nvidia Hopper, 2022 L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 256KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad Cores: 144 Streaming Multiprocessors L2 Cache: 60 MB shared  Example of data movement between GPU global memory (DRAM) and GPU cores. NVIDIA V100 & A100 Memory Hierarchy A100 feature: Direct copy from L2 to scratchpad, bypassing L1 and register file. 85 https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/ en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-archit ecture-whitepaper. pdf NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU Architecture In-Depth 40 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU Architecture A100 improves SM bandwidth efficiency with a new load-global-store-shared asynchronous copy instruction that bypasses L1 cache and register file (RF). Additionally, A100’s more efficient Tensor Cores reduce shared memory (SMEM) loads. Figure 15. A100 SM Data Movement Efficiency New asynchronous barriers work together with the asynchronous copy instruction to enable efficient data fetch pipelines, and A100 increases maximum SMEM allocation per SM 1.7x to 164 KB (vs 96 KB on V100). With these improvements A100 SMs continuously data stream data to keep the L2 cache constantly utilized. L2 Cache and DRAM Bandwidth improvements - The NVIDIA A100 GPU’s increased number of SMs and more powerful Tensor Cores in turn increase the required data fetch rates from DRAM and L2 cache. To feed the Tensor Cores, A100 implements a 5-site HBM2 memory subsystem with bandwidth of 1555 GB/sec, over 1.7x faster than V100. A100 further provides 2.3x the L2 cache read bandwidth of V100. Alongside the raw data bandwidth improvements, A100 improves data fetch efficiency and reduces DRAM bandwidth demand with a 40 MB L2 cache that is almost 7x larger than that of Tesla V100. To fully exploit the L2 capacity A100 includes improved cache management controls. Optimized for neural network training and inferencing as well as general compute workloads, the new controls ensure that data in the cache is used more efficiently by minimizing writebacks to memory and keeping reused data in L2 to reduce redundant DRAM traffic.

Address tag byte in block 3 bits5 bits Classification of Cache Misses  Compulsory miss  first reference to an address (block) always results in a miss  subsequent references to the block should hit in cache unless the block is displaced from cache for the reasons below  Capacity miss  cache is too small to hold all needed data  defined as the misses that would occur even in a fully- associative cache (with optimal replacement) of the same capacity  Conflict miss  defined as any miss that is neither a compulsory nor a capacity miss 99 How to Reduce Each Miss Type  Compulsory  Caching (only accessed data) cannot help; larger blocks can  Prefetching helps: Anticipate which blocks will be needed soon  Conflict  More associativity  Other ways to get more associativity without making the cache associative  Victim cache  Better, randomized indexing into the cache  Software hints for eviction/replacement/promotion  Capacity  Utilize cache space better: keep blocks that will be referenced  Software management: divide working set and computation such that each “computation phase” fits in cache 100 How to Improve Cache Performance  Three fundamental goals  Reducing miss rate  Caveat: reducing miss rate can reduce performance if more costly-to-refetch blocks are evicted  Reducing miss latency or miss cost  Reducing hit latency or hit cost  The above three together affect performance 101 Improving Basic Cache Performance  Reducing miss rate  More associativity  Alternatives/enhancements to associativity  Victim caches, hashing, pseudo-associativity, skewed associativity  Better replacement/insertion policies  Software approaches  Reducing miss latency/cost  Multi-level caches  Critical word first  Subblocking/sectoring  Better replacement/insertion policies  Non-blocking caches (multiple cache misses in parallel)  Multiple accesses per cycle  Software approaches 102 Software Approaches for Higher Hit Rate  Restructuring data access patterns  Restructuring data layout  Loop interchange  Data structure separation/merging  Blocking  … 103 Restructuring Data Access Patterns (I)  Idea: Restructure data layout or data access patterns  Example: If column-major  x[i+1,j] follows x[i,j] in memory  x[i,j+1] is far away from x[i,j]  This is called loop interchange  Other optimizations can also increase hit rate  Loop fusion, array merging, … 104 Poor code for i = 1, rows for j = 1, columns sum = sum + x[i,j] Better code for j = 1, columns for i = 1, rows sum = sum + x[i,j] Improving Basic Cache Performance  Reducing miss rate  More associativity  Alternatives/enhancements to associativity  Victim caches, hashing, pseudo-associativity, skewed associativity  Better replacement/insertion policies  Software approaches  Reducing miss latency/cost  Multi-level caches  Critical word first  Subblocking/sectoring  Better replacement/insertion policies  Non-blocking caches (multiple cache misses in parallel)  Multiple accesses per cycle  Software approaches 105 Research Opportunities Research Opportunities  If you are interested in doing research in Computer Architecture, Security, Systems & Bioinformatics:  Email me and Prof. Mutlu with your interest  Take the seminar course and the “Computer Architecture” course  Do readings and assignments on your own & talk with us  There are many exciting projects and research positions, e.g.:  Novel memory/storage/computation/communication systems  New execution paradigms (e.g., in-memory computing)  Hardware security, safety, reliability, predictability  GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, PIM, heterogeneous systems, …  Security-architecture-reliability-energy-performance interactions  Architectures for genomics/proteomics/medical/health/AI/ML  A limited list is here: https://safari.ethz.ch/theses/ 107https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/projects.htm Bachelor’s Seminar in Computer Architecture  Fall 2024 (offered every Fall and Spring Semester)  2 credit units  Rigorous seminar on fundamental and cutting-edge topics in computer architecture  Critical paper presentation, review, and discussion of seminal and cutting-edge works in computer architecture  We will cover many ideas & issues, analyze their tradeoffs, perform critical thinking and brainstorming  Participation, presentation, synthesis report, lots of discussion  You can register for the course online  https://safari.ethz.ch/architecture_seminar 108 Bachelor’s Seminar in Computer Architecture 109 Bachelor’s Seminar in Computer Architecture 110 Research Opportunities  If you are interested in doing research in Computer Architecture, Security, Systems & Bioinformatics:  Email me and Prof. Mutlu with your interest  Take the seminar course and the “Computer Architecture” course  Do readings and assignments on your own & talk with us  There are many exciting projects and research positions, e.g.:  Novel memory/storage/computation/communication systems  New execution paradigms (e.g., in-memory computing)  Hardware security, safety, reliability, predictability  GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, PIM, heterogeneous systems, …  Security-architecture-reliability-energy-performance interactions  Architectures for genomics/proteomics/medical/health/AI/ML  A limited list is here: https://safari.ethz.ch/theses/ 111https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/projects.htmhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV2OuB2djEs SAFARI Introduction & Research Computer architecture, HW/SW, systems, bioinformatics, security, memory Digital Design & Computer Arch.

 Many decisions and questions  Shared vs. private caches  How to maximize performance of the entire system?  How to provide QoS & predictable perf. to different threads in a shared cache?  Should cache management algorithms be aware of threads?  How should space be allocated to threads in a shared cache?  Should we store data in compressed format in some caches?  How do we do better reuse prediction & management in caches? 135 Private vs. Shared Caches  Private cache: Cache belongs to one core (a shared block can be in multiple caches)  Shared cache: Cache is shared by multiple cores 136 CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 L2 CACHE L2 CACHE L2 CACHE DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE Resource Sharing Concept and Advantages  Idea: Instead of dedicating a hardware resource to a hardware context, allow multiple contexts to use it  Example resources: functional units, pipeline, caches, buses, memory, interconnects, storage  Why? + Resource sharing improves utilization/efficiency  throughput  When a resource is left idle by one thread, another thread can use it; no need to replicate shared data + Reduces communication latency  For example, data shared between multiple threads can be kept in the same cache in multithreaded processors + Compatible with the shared memory programming model 137 Resource Sharing Disadvantages  Resource sharing results in contention for resources  When the resource is not idle, another thread cannot use it  If space is occupied by one thread, another thread needs to re- occupy it - Sometimes reduces each or some thread’s performance - Thread performance can be worse than when it is run alone - Eliminates performance isolation  inconsistent performance across runs - Thread performance depends on co-executing threads - Uncontrolled (free-for-all) sharing degrades quality of service - Causes unfairness, starvation Need to efficiently and fairly utilize shared resources 138 Private vs. Shared Caches  Private cache: Cache belongs to one core (a shared block can be in multiple caches)  Shared cache: Cache is shared by multiple cores 139 CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 L2 CACHE L2 CACHE L2 CACHE DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE Shared Caches Between Cores  Advantages:  High effective capacity  Dynamic partitioning of available cache space  No fragmentation due to static partitioning  If one core does not utilize some space, another core can  Easier to maintain coherence (a cache block is in a single location)  Disadvantages  Slower access (cache not tightly coupled with the core)  Cores incur conflict misses due to other cores’ accesses  Misses due to inter-core interference  Some cores can destroy the hit rate of other cores  Guaranteeing a minimum level of service (or fairness) to each core is harder (how much space, how much bandwidth?) 140 Example: Problem with Shared Caches 141 L2 $ L1 $ …… Processor Core 1 L1 $ Processor Core 2←t1 Kim et al., “Fair Cache Sharing and Partitioning in a Chip Multiprocessor Architecture,” PACT 2004.

Resource Sharing vs. Partitioning  Sharing improves throughput  Better utilization of space  Partitioning provides performance isolation (predictable performance)  Dedicated space  Can we get the benefits of both?  Idea: Design shared resources such that they are efficiently utilized, controllable and partitionable  No wasted resource + QoS mechanisms for threads 144 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 145https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Tqlw8gxOU&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9OhoVQBXYFIZywZXCPl4M_&index=17 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 146https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9FhGRB3HoA&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk_d5dI-TM7&index=29 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 147https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siz86__PD4w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk_d5dI-TM7&index=30 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management  Computer Architecture, Fall 2018, Lecture 18b  Multi-Core Cache Management (ETH, Fall 2018)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9FhGRB3HoA&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQM hylk_d5dI-TM7&index=29  Computer Architecture, Fall 2018, Lecture 19a  Multi-Core Cache Management II (ETH, Fall 2018)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siz86__PD4w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQM hylk_d5dI-TM7&index=30  Computer Architecture, Fall 2017, Lecture 15  Multi-Core Cache Management (ETH, Fall 2017)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Tqlw8gxOU&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9OhoVQBXY FIZywZXCPl4M_&index=17 148https://www.youtube.com/onurmutlulectures Lectures on Memory Resource Management 149https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nnI807nCkc&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7xRPS-wisBN&index=21 Lectures on Memory Resource Management  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 11a  Memory Controllers (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeG773OgiMQ&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz 7xRPS-wisBN&index=20  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 11b  Memory Interference and QoS (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nnI807nCkc&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7 xRPS-wisBN&index=21  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 13  Memory Interference and QoS II (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axye9VqQT7w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxU z7xRPS-wisBN&index=26  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 2a  Memory Performance Attacks (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJzZbwgBfy8&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7 xRPS-wisBN&index=2 150https://www.youtube.com/onurmutlulectures Cache Coherence Cache Coherence  Basic question: If multiple processors cache the same block, how do they ensure they all see a consistent state? 152 P1 P2 x Interconnection Network Main Memory 1000 The Cache Coherence Problem 153 P1 P2 x Interconnection Network Main Memory ld r2, x 1000 1000 The Cache Coherence Problem 154 P1 P2 x Interconnection Network Main Memory ld r2, x ld r2, x 1000 1000 1000 The Cache Coherence Problem 155 P1 P2 x Interconnection Network Main Memory ld r2, x add r1, r2, r4 st x, r1 ld r2, x 1000 10002000 The Cache Coherence Problem 156 P1 P2 x Interconnection Network Main Memory ld r2, x add r1, r2, r4 st x, r1 ld r2, x 1000 10002000 ld r5, x Should NOT load 1000 Hardware Cache Coherence  Basic idea:  A processor/cache broadcasts its write/update to a memory location to all other processors  Another processor/cache that has the location either updates or invalidates its local copy 157 A Very Simple Coherence Scheme (VI)  Idea: All caches “snoop” (observe) each other’s write/read operations. If a processor writes to a block, all others invalidate the block.  A simple protocol: 158  Write-through, no- write-allocate cache  Actions of the local processor on the cache block: PrRd, PrWr,  Actions that are broadcast on the bus for the block: BusRd, BusWr PrWr / BusWr Valid BusWr Invalid PrWr / BusWr PrRd / BusRd PrRd/-- Lecture on Cache Coherence 159https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WlyezeaII&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7xRPS-wisBN&index=38 Lecture on Memory Ordering & Consistency 160https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suy09mzTbiQ&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7xRPS-wisBN&index=37 Lecture on Cache Coherence & Consistency  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 21  Cache Coherence (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WlyezeaII&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7 xRPS-wisBN&index=38  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 20  Memory Ordering & Consistency (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suy09mzTbiQ&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz 7xRPS-wisBN&index=37  Computer Architecture, Spring 2015, Lecture 28  Memory Consistency & Cache Coherence (CMU, Spring 2015)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfjT1a0vi4E&list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3JCL 1TWybTDtKq&index=32  Computer Architecture, Spring 2015, Lecture 29  Cache Coherence (CMU, Spring 2015)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6DZchnMYcw&list=PL5PHm2jkkXmi5CxxI7b3 JCL1TWybTDtKq&index=33 161https://www.youtube.com/onurmutlulectures Additional Slides: Cache Coherence 162 Two Cache Coherence Methods  How do we ensure that the proper caches are updated?  Snoopy Bus [Goodman ISCA 1983, Papamarcos+ ISCA 1984]  Bus-based, single point of serialization for all memory requests  Processors observe other processors’ actions  E.g.: P1 makes “read-exclusive” request for A on bus, P0 sees this and invalidates its own copy of A  Directory [Censier and Feautrier, IEEE ToC 1978]  Single point of serialization per block, distributed among nodes  Processors make explicit requests for blocks  Directory tracks which caches have each block  Directory coordinates invalidations and updates  E.g.: P1 asks directory for exclusive copy, directory asks P0 to invalidate, waits for ACK, then responds to P1 163 Directory Based Coherence  Idea: A logically-central directory keeps track of where the copies of each cache block reside. Caches consult this directory to ensure coherence.  An example mechanism:  For each cache block in memory, store P+1 bits in directory  One bit for each cache, indicating whether the block is in cache  Exclusive bit: indicates that a cache has the only copy of the block and can update it without notifying others  On a read: set the cache’s bit and arrange the supply of data  On a write: invalidate all caches that have the block and reset their bits  Have an “exclusive bit” associated with each block in each cache (so that the cache can update the exclusive block silently) 164 Directory Based Coherence Example (I) 165 Directory Based Coherence Example (I) 166 Maintaining Coherence  Need to guarantee that all processors see a consistent value (i.e., consistent updates) for the same memory location  Writes to location A by P0 should be seen by P1 (eventually), and all writes to A should appear in some order  Coherence needs to provide:  Write propagation: guarantee that updates will propagate  Write serialization: provide a consistent order seen by all processors for the same memory location  Need a global point of serialization for this write ordering 167 Coherence: Update vs. Invalidate  How can we safely update replicated data?  Option 1 (Update protocol): push an update to all copies  Option 2 (Invalidate protocol): ensure there is only one copy (local), update it  On a Read:  If local copy is Invalid, put out request  (If another node has a copy, it returns it, otherwise memory does) 168 Coherence: Update vs. Invalidate (II)  On a Write:  Read block into cache as before Update Protocol:  Write to block, and simultaneously broadcast written data and address to sharers  (Other nodes update the data in their caches if block is present) Invalidate Protocol:  Write to block, and simultaneously broadcast invalidation of address to sharers  (Other nodes invalidate block in their caches if block is present) 169 Update vs. Invalidate Tradeoffs  Which one is better? Update or invalidate?  Write frequency and sharing behavior are critical  Update + If sharer set is constant and updates are infrequent, avoids the cost of invalidate-reacquire (broadcast update pattern) - If data is rewritten without intervening reads by other cores, updates would be useless - Write-through cache policy  bus can become a bottleneck  Invalidate + After invalidation, core has exclusive access rights + Only cores that keep reading after each write retain a copy - If write contention is high, leads to ping-ponging (rapid invalidation-reacquire traffic from different processors) 170 Additional Slides: Memory Interference 171 Inter-Thread/Application Interference  Problem: Threads share the memory system, but memory system does not distinguish between threads’ requests  Existing memory systems  Free-for-all, shared based on demand  Control algorithms thread-unaware and thread-unfair  Aggressive threads can deny service to others  Do not try to reduce or control inter-thread interference 172 Unfair Slowdowns due to Interference (Core 0) (Core 1) Moscibroda and Mutlu, “Memory performance attacks: Denial of memory service in multi-core systems,” USENIX Security 2007. matlab (Core 1) gcc (Core 2) 173174 Uncontrolled Interference: An Example CORE 1 CORE 2 L2 CACHE L2 CACHE DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER DRAM Bank 0 DRAM Bank 1 DRAM Bank 2 Shared DRAM Memory System Multi-Core Chip unfairness INTERCONNECT stream random DRAM Bank 3 // initialize large arrays A, B for (j=0; j<N; j++) { index = rand(); A[index] = B[index]; … } 175 A Memory Performance Hog STREAM - Sequential memory access - Very high row buffer locality (96% hit rate) - Memory intensive RANDOM - Random memory access - Very low row buffer locality (3% hit rate) - Similarly memory intensive // initialize large arrays A, B for (j=0; j<N; j++) { index = j*linesize; A[index] = B[index]; … } streaming random Moscibroda and Mutlu, “Memory Performance Attacks,” USENIX Security 2007. 176 What Does the Memory Hog Do?

 Least recently used (LRU) replacement: the least recently used block in a set is evicted when the cache is full. 204 Types of Misses  Compulsory: first time data is accessed  Capacity: cache too small to hold all data of interest  Conflict: data of interest maps to same location in cache  Miss penalty: time it takes to retrieve a block from lower level of hierarchy 205 LRU Replacement # MIPS assembly lw $t0, 0x04($0) lw $t1, 0x24($0) lw $t2, 0x54($0) DataTagV DataTagVU DataTagV DataTagVU (a) (b) Set Number 3 (11) 2 (10) 1 (01) 0 (00) Set Number 3 (11) 2 (10) 1 (01) 0 (00) 206 LRU Replacement # MIPS assembly lw $t0, 0x04($0) lw $t1, 0x24($0) lw $t2, 0x54($0) DataTagV 0 DataTagV 0 0 0 0 0 U mem[0x00...04]1 00...000mem[0x00...24] 100...010 0 0 0 0 DataTagV 0 DataTagV 0 0 0 0 0 U mem[0x00...54]1 00...101mem[0x00...24] 100...010 0 0 0 1 (a) (b) Way 1 Way 0 Way 1 Way 0 Set 3 (11) Set 2 (10) Set 1 (01) Set 0 (00) Set 3 (11) Set 2 (10) Set 1 (01) Set 0 (00) 207 Slides for Future Lectures 208 Issues in Set-Associative Caches  Think of each block in a set having a “priority”  Indicating how important it is to keep the block in the cache  Key issue: How do you determine/adjust block priorities?  There are three key decisions in a set:  Insertion, promotion, eviction (replacement)  Insertion: What happens to priorities on a cache fill?  Where to insert the incoming block, whether or not to insert the block  Promotion: What happens to priorities on a cache hit?  Whether and how to change block priority  Eviction/replacement: What happens to priorities on a cache miss?  Which block to evict and how to adjust priorities 209 Eviction/Replacement Policy  Which block in the set to replace on a cache miss?  Any invalid block first  If all are valid, consult the replacement policy  Random  FIFO  Least recently used (how to implement?)  Not most recently used  Least frequently used?  Least costly to re-fetch?  Why would memory accesses have different cost?  Hybrid replacement policies  Optimal replacement policy? 210 Implementing LRU  Idea: Evict the least recently accessed block  Problem: Need to keep track of access ordering of blocks  Question: 2-way set associative cache:  What do you minimally need to implement LRU perfectly?  Question: 4-way set associative cache:  What do you minimally need to implement LRU perfectly?  How many different orderings possible for the 4 blocks in the set?  How many bits needed to encode the LRU order of a block?  What is the logic needed to determine the LRU victim?  Repeat for N-way set associative cache 211 Approximations of LRU  Most modern processors do not implement “true LRU” (also called “perfect LRU”) in highly-associative caches  Why?  True LRU is complex  LRU is an approximation to predict locality anyway (i.e., not the best possible cache management policy)  Examples:  Not MRU (not most recently used)  Hierarchical LRU: divide the N-way set into M “groups”, track the MRU group and the MRU way in each group  Victim-NextVictim Replacement: Only keep track of the victim and the next victim 212 Cache Replacement Policy: LRU or Random  LRU vs. Random: Which one is better?  Example: 4-way cache, cyclic references to A, B, C, D, E  0% hit rate with LRU policy  Set thrashing: When the “program working set” in a set is larger than set associativity  Random replacement policy is better when thrashing occurs  In practice:  Performance of replacement policy depends on workload  Average hit rate of LRU and Random are similar  Best of both Worlds: Hybrid of LRU and Random  How to choose between the two? Set sampling  See Qureshi et al., ”A Case for MLP-Aware Cache Replacement,” ISCA 2006. 213 What Is the Optimal Replacement Policy?  Belady’s OPT  Replace the block that is going to be referenced furthest in the future by the program  Belady, “A study of replacement algorithms for a virtual-storage computer,” IBM Systems Journal, 1966.  How do we implement this? Simulate?  Is this optimal for minimizing miss rate?  Is this optimal for minimizing execution time?  No. Cache miss latency/cost varies from block to block!  Two reasons: Where miss is serviced from and miss overlapping  Qureshi et al. “A Case for MLP-Aware Cache Replacement,\" ISCA 2006. 214 Recommended Reading  Key observation: Some misses more costly than others as their latency is exposed as stall time. Reducing miss rate is not always good for performance. Cache replacement should take into account cost of misses.  Moinuddin K. Qureshi, Daniel N. Lynch, Onur Mutlu, and Yale N.

Slides (ppt) 215 What’s In A Tag Store Entry?  Valid bit  Tag  Replacement policy bits  Dirty bit?  Write back vs. write through caches 216 Handling Writes (I)  When do we write the modified data in a cache to the next level?  Write through: At the time the write happens  Write back: When the block is evicted  Write-back + Can combine multiple writes to the same block before eviction  Potentially saves bandwidth between cache levels + saves energy -- Need a bit in the tag store indicating the block is “dirty/modified”  Write-through + Simpler design + All levels are up to date & consistent  Simpler cache coherence: no need to check close-to-processor caches’ tag stores for presence -- More bandwidth intensive; no combining of writes 217 Handling Writes (II)  Do we allocate a cache block on a write miss?  Allocate on write miss: Yes  No-allocate on write miss: No  Allocate on write miss + Can combine writes instead of writing each individually to next level + Simpler because write misses can be treated the same way as read misses -- Requires transfer of the whole cache block  No-allocate + Conserves cache space if locality of written blocks is low (potentially better cache hit rate) 218 Handling Writes (III)  What if the processor writes to an entire block over a small amount of time?  Is there any need to bring the block into the cache from memory in the first place?  Why do we not simply write to only a portion of the block, i.e., subblock  E.g., 4 bytes out of 64 bytes  Problem: Valid and dirty bits are associated with the entire 64 bytes, not with each individual 4 bytes 219 Subblocked (Sectored) Caches  Idea: Divide a block into subblocks (or sectors)  Have separate valid and dirty bits for each subblock (sector)  Allocate only a subblock (or a subset of subblocks) on a request ++ No need to transfer the entire cache block into the cache (A write simply validates and updates a subblock) ++ More freedom in transferring subblocks into the cache (a cache block does not need to be in the cache fully) (How many subblocks do you transfer on a read?) -- More complex design -- May not exploit spatial locality fully 220 tagsubblockvsubblockv subblockvd d d Instruction vs. Data Caches  Separate or Unified?  Pros and Cons of Unified: + Dynamic sharing of cache space: no overprovisioning that might happen with static partitioning (i.e., separate I and D caches) -- Instructions and data can evict/thrash each other (i.e., no guaranteed space for either) -- I and D are accessed in different places in the pipeline. Where do we place the unified cache for fast access?  First level caches are almost always split  Mainly for the last reason above – pipeline constraints  Outer level caches are almost always unified 221 Multi-level Caching in a Pipelined Design  First-level caches (instruction and data)  Decisions very much affected by cycle time & pipeline structure  Small, lower associativity; latency is critical  Tag store and data store usually accessed in parallel  Second- and third-level caches  Decisions need to balance hit rate and access latency  Usually large and highly associative; latency not as important  Tag store and data store can be accessed serially  Serial vs. Parallel access of levels  Serial: Second level cache accessed only if first-level misses  Second level does not see the same accesses as the first  First level acts as a filter (filters some temporal and spatial locality)  Management policies are therefore different 222 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 223Source: https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested Apple M1, 2021 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 224Source: https://twitter.com/Locuza_/status/1454152714930331652 Intel Alder Lake, 2021 Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 225https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-5000-zen-3-vermeer-undressed-high-res-die-shots-close-ups-pictured-detailed/ AMD Ryzen 5000, 2020 Core Count: 8 cores/16 threads L1 Caches: 32 KB per core L2 Caches: 512 KB per core L3 Cache: 32 MB shared AMD’s 3D Last Level Cache (2021) 226https://youtu.be/gqAYMx34euU https://www.tech-critter.com/amd-keynote-computex-2021/ https://community.microcenter.com/discussion/5 134/comparing-zen-3-to-zen-2 Additional 64 MB L3 cache die stacked on top of the processor die - Connected using Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) - Total of 96 MB L3 cache AMD increases the L3 size of their 8-core Zen 3 processors from 32 MB to 96 MB Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 227https://www.it-techblog.de/ibm-power10-prozessor-mehr-speicher-mehr-tempo-mehr-sicherheit/09/2020/ IBM POWER10, 2020 Cores: 15-16 cores, 8 threads/core L2 Caches: 2 MB per core L3 Cache: 120 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 228https://www.tomshardware.com/news/infrared-photographer-photos-nvidia-ga102-ampere-silicon Nvidia Ampere, 2020 Cores: 128 Streaming Multiprocessors L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 192KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad L2 Cache: 40 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 229https://wccftech.com/nvidia-hopper-gpus-featuring-mcm-technology-tape-out-soon-rumor/ Nvidia Hopper, 2022 L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 256KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad Cores: 144 Streaming Multiprocessors L2 Cache: 60 MB shared Deeper and Larger Cache Hierarchies 230https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/ Nvidia Hopper, 2022 L1 Cache or Scratchpad: 256KB per SM Can be used as L1 Cache and/or Scratchpad Cores: 144 Streaming Multiprocessors L2 Cache: 60 MB shared  Example of data movement between GPU global memory (DRAM) and GPU cores. NVIDIA V100 & A100 Memory Hierarchy A100 feature: Direct copy from L2 to scratchpad, bypassing L1 and register file. 231https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/ en-zz/Solutions/data-center/nvidia-ampere-archit ecture-whitepaper. pdf NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU Architecture In-Depth 40 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU Architecture A100 improves SM bandwidth efficiency with a new load-global-store-shared asynchronous copy instruction that bypasses L1 cache and register file (RF). Additionally, A100’s more efficient Tensor Cores reduce shared memory (SMEM) loads. Figure 15. A100 SM Data Movement Efficiency New asynchronous barriers work together with the asynchronous copy instruction to enable efficient data fetch pipelines, and A100 increases maximum SMEM allocation per SM 1.7x to 164 KB (vs 96 KB on V100). With these improvements A100 SMs continuously data stream data to keep the L2 cache constantly utilized. L2 Cache and DRAM Bandwidth improvements - The NVIDIA A100 GPU’s increased number of SMs and more powerful Tensor Cores in turn increase the required data fetch rates from DRAM and L2 cache. To feed the Tensor Cores, A100 implements a 5-site HBM2 memory subsystem with bandwidth of 1555 GB/sec, over 1.7x faster than V100. A100 further provides 2.3x the L2 cache read bandwidth of V100. Alongside the raw data bandwidth improvements, A100 improves data fetch efficiency and reduces DRAM bandwidth demand with a 40 MB L2 cache that is almost 7x larger than that of Tesla V100. To fully exploit the L2 capacity A100 includes improved cache management controls. Optimized for neural network training and inferencing as well as general compute workloads, the new controls ensure that data in the cache is used more efficiently by minimizing writebacks to memory and keeping reused data in L2 to reduce redundant DRAM traffic.

+ Resource sharing improves utilization/efficiency  throughput  When a resource is left idle by one thread, another thread can use it; no need to replicate shared data + Reduces communication latency  For example, data shared between multiple threads can be kept in the same cache in multithreaded processors + Compatible with the shared memory programming model 285 Resource Sharing Disadvantages  Resource sharing results in contention for resources  When the resource is not idle, another thread cannot use it  If space is occupied by one thread, another thread needs to re- occupy it - Sometimes reduces each or some thread’s performance - Thread performance can be worse than when it is run alone - Eliminates performance isolation  inconsistent performance across runs - Thread performance depends on co-executing threads - Uncontrolled (free-for-all) sharing degrades QoS - Causes unfairness, starvation Need to efficiently and fairly utilize shared resources 286 Private vs. Shared Caches  Private cache: Cache belongs to one core (a shared block can be in multiple caches)  Shared cache: Cache is shared by multiple cores 287 CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 L2 CACHE L2 CACHE L2 CACHE DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE CORE 0 CORE 1 CORE 2 CORE 3 DRAM MEMORY CONTROLLER L2 CACHE Shared Caches Between Cores  Advantages:  High effective capacity  Dynamic partitioning of available cache space  No fragmentation due to static partitioning  If one core does not utilize some space, another core can  Easier to maintain coherence (a cache block is in a single location)  Disadvantages  Slower access (cache not tightly coupled with the core)  Cores incur conflict misses due to other cores’ accesses  Misses due to inter-core interference  Some cores can destroy the hit rate of other cores  Guaranteeing a minimum level of service (or fairness) to each core is harder (how much space, how much bandwidth?) 288 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 289https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Tqlw8gxOU&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9OhoVQBXYFIZywZXCPl4M_&index=17 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 290https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9FhGRB3HoA&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk_d5dI-TM7&index=29 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management 291https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siz86__PD4w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk_d5dI-TM7&index=30 Lectures on Multi-Core Cache Management  Computer Architecture, Fall 2018, Lecture 18b  Multi-Core Cache Management (ETH, Fall 2018)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9FhGRB3HoA&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQM hylk_d5dI-TM7&index=29  Computer Architecture, Fall 2018, Lecture 19a  Multi-Core Cache Management II (ETH, Fall 2018)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Siz86__PD4w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQM hylk_d5dI-TM7&index=30  Computer Architecture, Fall 2017, Lecture 15  Multi-Core Cache Management (ETH, Fall 2017)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Tqlw8gxOU&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9OhoVQBXY FIZywZXCPl4M_&index=17 292https://www.youtube.com/onurmutlulectures Lectures on Memory Resource Management 293https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nnI807nCkc&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7xRPS-wisBN&index=21 Lectures on Memory Resource Management  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 11a  Memory Controllers (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeG773OgiMQ&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz 7xRPS-wisBN&index=20  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 11b  Memory Interference and QoS (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nnI807nCkc&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7 xRPS-wisBN&index=21  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 13  Memory Interference and QoS II (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axye9VqQT7w&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxU z7xRPS-wisBN&index=26  Computer Architecture, Fall 2020, Lecture 2a  Memory Performance Attacks (ETH, Fall 2020)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJzZbwgBfy8&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9xidyIgBxUz7 xRPS-wisBN&index=2 294https://www.youtube.com/onurmutlulectures Cache Coherence Cache Coherence  Basic question: If multiple processors cache the same block, how do they ensure they all see a consistent state?
