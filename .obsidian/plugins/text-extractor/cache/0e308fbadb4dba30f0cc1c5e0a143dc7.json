(a) (2 points) For the following four numbers given in decimal or hexadecimal nota- tion, write the corresponding binary number using the indicated format. (−6)10 using 6-bit sign magnitude: (10 0110)2 (37)10 using 6-bit unsigned: (10 0101)2 (−28)10 using 6-bit two’s complement: (10 0100)2 (2B)16 using 6-bit unsigned: (10 1011)2 (b) (3 points) State whether the following statements about the binary representation of numbers are true or false. Give brief explanations for the statements that are false. • Both two’s complement and sign/magnitude representation can be used to rep- resent negative numbers in binary. Solution: True, however it is more diﬃcult to design arithmetic circuits that work with sign/magnitude format. Still they are used. • Using N bits it is possible to represent 2N diﬀerent numbers when an unsigned number system is used. Solution: True. • While there are methods to represent both positive and negative integers, it is not possible to represent fractions or real numbers using binary numbers. Solution: False, ﬁxed and ﬂoating point number systems can be used to represent such numbers. Second Session Exam Page 2 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 2. Consider the following state diagram of an FSM with 1-bit input (I) and 1-bit output (Z). A Z=1 B Z=0 D Z=0 C Z=1 E Z=0 F Z=1 I=0 I=0 I=0 I=1 I=1 I=1 I=0 I=1 Reset The state has been coded using a 3-bit vector S = S2 S1 S0 according to the following table: State name S2 S1 S0 A 0 0 0 B 0 0 1 C 0 1 0 D 0 1 1 E 1 0 0 F 1 0 1 (a) (1 point) Is this a Moore or Mealy type FSM? Brieﬂy explain. Solution: Moore, outputs depend only on the present state and nothing else. Second Session Exam Page 3 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (b) (6 points) Fill in the following state transition table that determines the next state vector N = N2 N1 N0 based on the current state S and the input I. State Input Next State name S2 S1 S0 I name N2 N1 N0 A 0 0 0 X B 0 0 1 B 0 0 1 0 C 0 1 0 B 0 0 1 1 E 1 0 0 C 0 1 0 0 D 0 1 1 C 0 1 0 1 A 0 0 0 D 0 1 1 0 D 0 1 1 D 0 1 1 1 A 0 0 0 E 1 0 0 X F 1 0 1 F 1 0 1 0 E 1 0 0 F 1 0 1 1 C 0 1 0 Note that there are diﬀerent ways of writing this table to represent the same result. (c) (3 points) Write the Next State Equations from the table you have ﬁlled above using either Product of Sums (POS) or Sum of Products (SOP) form. Do not spend time minimizing the equations, this will be next question. Solution: N0 = S2 S1 S0 + S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 N1 = S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 I N2 = S2 S1 S0 I + S2 S1 S0 + S2 S1 S0 I Second Session Exam Page 4 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (d) (6 points) Minimize the Next State Equations from the previous part. Note that the FSM requires only six states. This means that there are several State (S) / Input(I) combinations for which the outputs can be treated as Don’t Care, which should help minimizing the boolean equations. Hint: Consider using Karnaugh diagrams to solve this problem. Solution: It is important to note that for S2 S1 = 11 the next state N can be taken as N2 N1 N0 = XXX. This can simplify the Boolean equations signiﬁcantly. It is best to use a Karnaugh map to ﬁnd the simpliﬁcations. 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 X X X X 1 1 0 0 S0I S2S1 00 01 11 10 00 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 X X X X 0 0 1 0 S0I S2S1 00 01 11 10 00 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 X X X X 1 1 0 1 S0I S2S1 00 01 11 10 00 N0 N1 N2 N0 = S1 S0 + S1 I N1 = S1 I + S2 S0 I + S2 S0 I N2 = S2 S0 + S2 I + S2 S1 S0 I Second Session Exam Page 5 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 This page intentionally left blank Second Session Exam Page 6 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 3.

In this question you are required to calculate diﬀerent timing paths for the circuit given below.Register0 2:1 MUXRegisterRegisterRegister A B C B D Note that the block B is used twice. All the inputs are supplied from external registers. The timing properties of all the blocks used in the circuit are given in the table below: Block Propagation Delay Contamination Delay Setup Time Hold Time Register 0.0 ns 0.0 ns 0.1 ns 0.0 ns 2:1 Multiplexer 0.3 ns 0.3 ns n.a. n.a. A 0.6 ns 0.4 ns n.a. n.a. B 1.8 ns 1.0 ns n.a. n.a. C 1.2 ns 0.8 ns n.a. n.a. D 1.0 ns 0.8 ns n.a. n.a. Hint: 1 1 ns = 1 GHz, a clock with 1 GHz has a period of 1 ns. 1 GHz = 1000 MHz Second Session Exam Page 9 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (a) (2 points) What is the critical path of this circuit? Calculate its path delay. Solution: Critical path is the longest timing path in the circuit: CriticalP ath = tpd,A + tpd,B + tpd,C + tpd,mux + tsetup,F F = 0.6 + 1.8 + 1.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 ns = 4.0 ns (b) (1 point) What is the maximum operating frequency of this circuit? Solution: Maximum operating frequency is 1/Critical Path, 1/4 ns = 250 M Hz. (c) (2 points) What is the shortest path of this circuit ? Solution: The short path is the fastest route a signal can propagate through the circuit. In this case it is the signal that goes through the select input of the multiplexer and reaches the register. This signal only passes through the multiplexer, so the short path is 0.3 ns. Second Session Exam Page 10 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (d) (8 points) In order to make the circuit faster, it is suggested to introduce pipelining. Determine the best location between the blocks to place the pipeline registers assuming a one stage pipeline implementation and redraw the schematic. (Hint: in a one stage pipeline, the latency increases only by 1 clock cycle). Solution: 0 2:1 MUXRegisterRegisterRegister A B C B DRegisterRegisterRegisterRegister Note that you will have to insert a pipeline register in all paths, including the multiplexer control register. (e) (2 points) What is the critical path of this pipelined circuit and calculate its path delay. Solution: CriticalP ath = tpd,A + tpd,B + tsetup,F F = 0.6 + 1.8 + 0.1 ns = 2.5 ns Second Session Exam Page 11 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (f) (1 point) What is the speed-up we have achieved by pipelining? Solution: Old critical path / New Critical path = 4.0 / 2.5 = 1.6. The new circuit has a 60% shorter critical path, therefore it can be clocked 60% faster. (g) (2 points) Why did we not achieve the theoretical maximum speed-up from the pipelining. State at least two reasons. Solution: 1. It was not possible to place the pipeline registers at exactly half the pre- vious critical path. Unless we move the pipeline registers into the blocks themselves we can not improve any more. 2. The pipeline register has a small overhead (tsetup,F F > 0). Even if we managed to divide the circuit in equal halves, this overhead would not allow us to reach 100% speedup. The problem gets worse the shorter the critical path is. Second Session Exam Page 12 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 5. The questions 5, 6 and 7 are based on the MIPS assembly code given below. addi $t0, $0, 8 xor $s0, $s0, $s0 loop: beq $t0, $0, done lw $t1, 0x4($0) lw $t2, 0x24($0) add $t3, $t1, $s0 add $s0, $t2, $t3 addi $t0, $t0, -1 j loop done: (a) (2 points) Brieﬂy explain what the above MIPS assembly code does. Solution: The program will execute a loop 8 times. In each iteration of the loop, the content of the address 0x0000 0004 and the content of the address 0x0000 0024 will be added together and added to the register $s0 which was initialized to the value 0 (A xor A is 0). (b) (1 point) Assuming the data at memory location 0x0000 0004 is decimal 16 and at memory location 0x0000 0024 is decimal 32, what will be the content of the register $s0 in hexadecimal when the program execution jumps to done:? Solution: The program calculates 8×(mem(0x00000004)+mem(0x00000024)). This equals to 8 × (32 + 16) == 384. In hexadecimal this will be 0x0180. It is actually very easy to do the calculation if you do it in binary. Second Session Exam Page 13 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (c) (2 points) Brieﬂy explain the three diﬀerent MIPS instruction types (R, I, J) and show one instruction of each type from the example code above. Solution: R-type Uses up to three registers, two for source and one for destination. Example: xor $s0, $s0, $s0. I-type Uses a 16-bit constant as part of the instruction. Example: addi $t0, $0, 8. J-type Uses a 26-bit constant that can be used to calculate the address of the next instruction, allowing the program execution to jump to a new location. Example: j loop. Second Session Exam Page 14 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 6. In this question you are required to make calculations regarding the processor’s speed. For this question, use the MIPS assembly program from the previous section. (a) (2 points) How many instructions are executed until the program ﬁnishes? Solution: There are two initial instructions, and the loop contains 7 instruc- tions which is executed 8 times, in addition there is one last beq command that will be executed after the last loop. Ninstructions = 2 + (7 × 8) + 1 = 59 (56, or 58 could also be accepted) (b) (1 point) Assume that you are using a single cycle microarchitecture running at 1 GHz. If the CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) is 1, how long will it take for the program to ﬁnish execution? Solution: 59 instructions x 1 CPI = 59 clock cycles. At 1 GHz, 1 clock cycles is 1 ns, so the entire program will execute in 59 ns. (c) (2 points) In a second microarchitecture, due to a very slow memory, every load word (lw) instruction requires 10 clock cycles. Calculate the number of cycles needed to execute the entire program. Solution: The loop contains 2 lw instructions each take 10 clock cycles. The remaining 5 instructions take 1 clock cycle. Every loop takes 25 clock cycles. There are 8 iterations of the loop plus two additional initial instructions and one last beq: Ncycles = 2 + (8 × (5 × 1 + 2 × 10) + 1 = 203 (200, or 202 could also be accepted) (d) (1 point) For this second microarchitecture, what is the average CPI? (approximate numbers ±10% are ok ) Solution: There are 59 instructions that are executed in 203 clock cycles. CP I = 203/59 = 3.44. Acceptable are also approximate calculations CP I = 200/60 = 3.33 or CP I = 210/60 = 3.5 Second Session Exam Page 15 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 (e) (4 points) For the second microarchitecture with the slow memory, what can be done in both the code and the processor to improve the speed of this particular program other than using a faster memory. Write two short suggestions that would have the largest impact and brieﬂy explain why that would improve the perfor- mance. Note: The result of the program should depend on the two values stored in the memory, these can not assumed to be constants. Solution: • The most obvious problem is the slow memory access. Introducing a proper cache could alleviate this problem. The ﬁrst iterations would still be slow, but the remaining accesses would be fast. • The program could be written more eﬃciently. The loop essentially mul- tiplies the sum of the two values in memory by eight. Instead of a loop, a shift left operation could be used. lw $t1, 0x4($0) lw $t2, 0x24($0) add $s0, $t1, $s2 sll $s0, $s0, 3 • Standard pipelining will not work in this architecture, there are two con- secutive memory accesses which are the problem, all other instructions can already be calculated in a single cycle. • Using a better technology would increase the speed. However, this is not one of the easiest solutions. The ﬁrst two solutions are clearly better suited. Second Session Exam Page 16 of 17 Design of Digital Circuits 5th of February 2014 7. (6 points) A friend suggests adding a cache system to speed up the execution of MIPS assembly code on the micro-architecture from question 6 (slow load word (lw) instruction that requires 10 clock cycles for memory access). Which of the two cache design options would make the program in question 5 run faster? Brieﬂy explain why. Solution A A direct-mapped cache with a capacity of 8 words and an access time of tcache = 1 clock cycle Solution B A two-way set associative cache with the same capacity of 8 words, but with twice the access time tcache = 2 clock cycles. Note: The question is speciﬁc to the program in question 5 and not about speeding up any arbitrary program. Solution: In a direct mapped cache, there is only one location where data can be placed in a cache. In a direct mapped cache with 8 locations, the address 0x0000 0004 and 0x0000 0024 would map to the same cache location. If this cache is used, every memory access would result in a cache miss. Using solution A would make the program run even slower, as every memory access would have ﬁrst a cache miss (1 clock cycle) followed by the actual memory access (10 cycles). Ncycles = 2 + (8 × (5 + 2 × 11)) = 218 Solution A can not be used to speed up the program. In a 2-way set associative memory, there are two locations where data can be placed in a cache. Although the addresses 0x0000 0004 and 0x0000 0024 still map to the same set, they can both be placed in the cache. The ﬁrst two memory accesses would be compulsory misses requiring 12 clock cyles (2 for the cache miss plus 10 for the actual memory access). But for the following 7 iterations, every memory access would be a cache hit, requiring only 2 clock cycles. Ncycles = 2 + (7 × (5 + 2 × 2)) + (5 + 2 × 12) = 94 Solution B is the only viable alternative, that would speed up the program by more than 2x. Note that the program used is virtually identical to the one used in class notes to explain the problems with Direct-mapped cache. Second Session Exam Page 17 of 17","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
