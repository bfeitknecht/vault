Prove the following statements: (a) Lunion ∈ LRE, (b) LU ≤m Lunion, and (c) Lunion ≤m LU. 10 points Task 21 On the Moodle platform, there is a video available for you which explains, using the example Ldiag ≤m Lempty, how to use mapping reductions (called EE-reductions in the German version of the book) to transfer results of non-enumerability (L /∈ LRE) from one problem to another. You have the opportunity to watch this video and then work through another example in person during the next tutorial session. There are no points or model solutions for this in-person task, but you can discuss the example in detail during the tutorial. 0 points Submission: On Friday, November 15, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
