(Theorem 5.23.) Now , since we have shown Z 5 to be a field, it remains to show that the polynomial x 2 + 4 x + 1 on Z 5 is irreducible (Theorem 5.37.). To do this, we must prove that x 2 + 4 x + 1 has no roots in Z 5 . Since Z 5 = { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } we do this: which concludes the proof, as the polynomial x 2 + 4 x + 1 is congruent to zero over no element in the field Z . □ (b) Prove that F ∗ = ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ Proof: To prove that F ∗ = ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ , we need to show two things: 1. F ∗ ⊆ ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ Every nonzero element in F can be represented as a ( x + 3 ) + b , where a , b ∈ Z 5 , and a is not congruent to 0. This is because x 2 + 4 x + 1 is irreducible in Z 5 [x ]. Let f ( x ) = a ( x + 3 ) + b be an arbitrary nonzero element in F ∗ . W e need to show that f ( x ) can be generated by ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . Consider the polynomial g ( x ) = x + 3 . Notice that g ( x ) generates the ideal ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . Therefore, any multiple of g ( x ) is in ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . Since f ( x ) is a multiple of g ( x ) , we can conclude that f ( x ) ∈ ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ , and thus, F ∗ ⊆ ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . 2. ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ ⊆ F ∗ Consider an arbitrary element h ( x ) = c ( x + 3 ) where c ∈ Z 5 and c is not congruent to 0. This element is in ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . Since x 2 + 4 x + 1 is irreducible, c ( x + 3 ) is nonzero, and thus, h ( x ) ∈ F ∗ . This is because every nonzero element in F can be expressed as a ( x + 3 ) + b . Therefore, ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ ⊆ F ∗ . Combining both steps, we can conclude that F ∗ = ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ , and we have shown that every nonzero element in F can be generated by ⟨ x + 3 ⟩ . □ (c) W rite a ( y ) = ( 2 x + 3 ) y 2 + ( 2 x + 1 ) y + 1 ∈ F [y ] as a product of irreducible polynomials. Hint: 2 x + 1 ≡ x 2 + 4 x + 1 2 ( x + 3 ) ∈ Z 5 [x ]. Proof: The given polynomial is a ( y ) = ( 2 x + 3 ) y 2 + ( 2 x + 1 ) y + 1 . Using the hint, we substitute ( 2 x + 1 ) with ( 2 ( x + 3 ) ) : a ( y ) = ( 2 ( x + 3 ) ) y 2 + ( 2 ( x + 3 ) ) y + 1 Factoring out the common factor ( 2 ( x + 3 ) ) : a ( y ) = 2 ( x + 3 ) ( y 2 + y ) + 1 x = 0 ⟹ 0 2 + 4 ( 0 ) + 1 ≡ ̸5 0 x = 1 ⟹ 1 2 + 4 ( 1 ) + 1 ≡ ̸5 0 x = 2 ⟹ 2 2 + 4 ( 2 ) + 1 ≡ ̸5 0 x = 3 ⟹ 3 2 + 4 ( 3 ) + 1 ≡ ̸5 0 x = 4 ⟹ 4 2 + 4 ( 4 ) + 1 ≡ ̸5 0 Factoring the quadratic ( y 2 + y ) over Z 5 : y 2 + y = y ( y + 1 ) Substituting this back into the expression: a ( y ) = 2 ( x + 3 ) y ( y + 1 ) + 1 So, the irreducible factorization of a ( y ) F [y ] is: a ( y ) = ( 2 ( x + 3 ) ) ⋅ y ⋅ ( y + 1 ) + 1 The irreducible polynomials are 2 ( x + 3 ) , y , and y + 1 . □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
