Network protocols are like a common language for computers. Examples of what protocols take care of: - Data formats - Timeouts - Communication setup - State machine and transitions 18 What is a protocol Problem: Too many protocols, we need a way to ”connect” them. ⇒ LAYERS 19 Why do we need layers? They represent abstractions and provide services to the layers above. Interfaces are deﬁned between the layers. - L5: Application → HTTP(S), SMTP, FTP, DNS, … - L4: Transport → TCP/UDP - L3: Network → IP - L2: Link → Ethernet - L1: Physical → bits + air/metal = communication 20 What are layers? 21 Layers visualized End-to-end Principle 23 End-to-End Principle No matter how reliable the network is, we still have to implement reliability checks at the end points of the connection. If we implement reliability at the network level, we may increase performance at the cost of increased network complexity. Network Metrics Three performance metrics: - Loss: How many packets are dropped in transit - Throughput: Rate at which a host receives data (including headers), always consider bottleneck link and its intervening trafﬁc - Delay (Latency): Time for a packet to reach the destination 25 Network Connections Average throughput [#bits/sec] = data size [#bits] transfer time [sec] 26 Throughput 27 Types of delay Node A Image source: ﬂaticon.com Node B Propagation DelayTransmission Delay Queuing Delay Processing Delay Transmission delay [sec] = Propagation delay [sec] = 28 Types of delay - Formulas packet size [#bits] link bandwidth [#bits/sec] link length [m] propagation speed [m/sec] If in doubt, solve for units ﬁrst -> then verify with numbers. Kahoot!!!Exercise #01 Question 1: Packet vs Circuit Switching 31 You think about changing all the Internet to circuit-switching instead of packet-switching. 1) Which application would mostly beneﬁt from this change? Which will not? We know circuit switching is good when peak/average throughput is small Good for VoIP, video streaming or similar applications that always transmit some data Bad for bursty applications such as web trafﬁc 2) Would circuit switching be more beneﬁcial for video streaming? Yes, circuit switching would guarantee a stable connection with constant available bandwidth Question 1: Packet vs Circuit Switching 32 You think about changing all the Internet to circuit-switching instead of packet-switching. 3) Which applications could beneﬁt from a mixed approach? A mixed approach is a middle ground between being wasteful & not giving any guarantees For example: Live streaming could send minimum information required to make the system work using a circuit, and send extra information that could improve quality in case the network is not too busy using packet switching Question 2: Cloud Services 33 Why use cloud services instead of one’s own infrastructure? Think about (1) handling peak usage, (2) providing global quality of service, and (3) maintenance. How do cloud services ameliorate these issues? 1) Lack of statistical multiplexing ability: The company would have to build a network to handle their peak load (as they would lose revenue if they did not). The network would remain severely underutilized during the rest of the time. In cloud-services can be scaled on-demand. Question 2: Cloud Services 34 Why use cloud services instead of one’s own infrastructure? Think about (1) handling peak usage, (2) providing global quality of service, and (3) maintenance. How do cloud services ameliorate these issues? 2) Locality: The company’s infrastructure would need good Internet access and manage content distribution on a world-wide scale. Buying small amounts of infrastructure and deploying/growing it globally is infeasible. Cloud services already have presence around the world and offer the rental of small amount of infrastructure. Question 2: Cloud Services 35 Why use cloud services instead of one’s own infrastructure? Think about (1) handling peak usage, (2) providing global quality of service, and (3) maintenance. How do cloud services ameliorate these issues? 3) Maintenance: Maintaining and operating data centers (across the globe) is highly specialized labor that a non-technical company does not possess. Cloud service companies (i.e., Amazon AWS) are specialized in maintaining large network infrastructure, as it’s its core business. Question 3: Provisioning 36 N users share the same up-link with capacity C Mbps to their Internet Service Provider. When online, a user will require U Mbps bandwidth. The probability of a user being online at any point in time is P online independent of other users. 1) What is the probability P inadequate that there is not enough available link capacity to fully satisfy the needs of the online users? The amount of users online is X The probability of a user being online is independent from other users ⇒ X follows a binomial distribution Inadequate: When the users online need more link capacity than is available Question 3: Provisioning 37 N users share the same up-link with capacity C Mbps to their Internet Service Provider. When online, a user will require U Mbps bandwidth. The probability of a user being online at any point in time is P online independent of other users. 1) What is the probability P inadequate that there is not enough available link capacity to fully satisfy the needs of the online users? The amount of users online is X Online users need more link capacity than is available Probability of exactly i users being online Question 3: Provisioning 38 N users share the same up-link with capacity C Mbps to their Internet Service Provider. When online, a user will require U Mbps bandwidth. The probability of a user being online at any point in time is P online independent of other users. 2) For N = 5 users, C = 20 Mbps, U = 7 Mbps, and P online = 0.3 What is is the probability of the link being inadequate? Question 3: Provisioning 39 N users share the same up-link with capacity C Mbps to their Internet Service Provider. When online, a user will require U Mbps bandwidth. The probability of a user being online at any point in time is P online independent of other users. 3) Given (N, U, P online , P max_risk) complete the algorithm below that computes the minimum C such that P inadequate≤ P max_risk Question 4: Queuing Delay 40 Suppose N packets are enqueued at a interface at the same time. Upon arrival of the packets, the queue is empty, and nothing is being transmitted currently. All packets are of size S and the transmission rate of the link is R. 1) What is the queueing delay for the ﬁrst packet? 0 (since there is nothing in the queue) 2) What is the queueing delay for the n-th packet? The packets enqueued Time to put a packet on the link (the same as transmission delay) Question 4: Queueing Delay 41 Suppose N packets are enqueued at a interface at the same time. Upon arrival of the packets, the queue is empty, and nothing is being transmitted currently. All packets are of size S and the transmission rate of the link is R. 3) What is the average queuing delay for the N packets? Question 5: Throughput in a Network 42 Calculate the throughput in a network and the time it takes to send a ﬁle over this network. Neglect any sort of delay and focus solely on the transmission rates of links. Congestion (and therefore packet loss) is also irrelevant. 1) The diagram below shows the capacities for each link in Mbps. Compute the throughput of this network also in Mbps. 2 2 2 2 2 2 Question 5: Throughput in a Network 43 Calculate the throughput in a network and the time it takes to send a ﬁle over this network.

Neglect any sort of delay and focus solely on the transmission rates of links. Congestion (and therefore packet loss) is also irrelevant. 1) The diagram below shows the capacities for each link in Mbps. Compute the throughput of this network also in Mbps. max ﬂow = min cut = 5 2) How can we compute the throughput systematically? (What we just did…) Ford-Fulkerson 3) Given a ﬁle F of size 19 million bits. How long does it take to transmit the whole ﬁle (again, neglecting any delay except for transmission delay)? The throughput R of the network is 5 Mbps and the ﬁle has F = 19 ∗ 10 6bits. Dividing F/R yields 3.8s Question 5: Throughput in a Network 46 Calculate the throughput in a network and the time it takes to send a ﬁle over this network. Neglect any sort of delay and focus solely on the transmission rates of links. Congestion (and therefore packet loss) is also irrelevant. Which infrastructure does DSL use? a) Television infrastructure b) Telephone infrastructure c) Its own infrastructure d) Other Which infrastructure does DSL use? a) Television infrastructure b) Telephone infrastructure c) Its own infrastructure d) Other 1) Short questions: Question 6: DSL 47 Still today many homes use a DSL connection to connect to the internet. 1) Short questions: Question 6: DSL 48 Still today many homes use a DSL connection to connect to the internet. Is the DSL connection symmetric? If not, brieﬂy explain why. a) Yes b) No. The download connection has higher bandwidth c) No. The upload connection has higher bandwidth Is the DSL connection symmetric? If not, brieﬂy explain why. a) Yes b) No. The download connection has higher bandwidth c) No. The upload connection has higher bandwidth → For an average home connection the amount of data that is downloaded is substantially larger than the data that is uploaded 2) Imagine being a content provider. Is using a DSL connection a good idea? As a content provider, we would need to send signiﬁcantly more data to the customer/user as a response than what we receive as a request Therefore for a content provider such a asymmetric connection is matched exactly in the incorrect direction! 3) Name two reasons why FTTH has not become the most used connection yet FTTH requires ﬁber optic cables, which are not laid in most older homes and doing so is expensive New technologies have also sped up DSL and cable, offering higher up- and download rates than the original protocols. Question 6: DSL 49 Still today many homes use a DSL connection to connect to the internet. Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate 50 Assume a client transmits data with the following transmission rate over time. Give all results with respect to m and k. 1) What is the peak rate P? The peak rate is the highest rate overall ⇒ P = m + k Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate 51 Assume a client transmits data with the following transmission rate over time. Give all results with respect to m and k. 2) What is the average rate A? The average rate is “average” transmission rate over time ⇒ A = m Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate 52 Assume a client transmits data with the following transmission rate over time. Give all results with respect to m and k. 3) Assume circuit switching. In order to transmit all of the data correctly without delays. What is the minimal bandwidth R that must be reserved? We need enough bandwidth to handle the peak rate ⇒ R = P = m + k Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate 53 Assume a client transmits data with the following transmission rate over time. Give all results with respect to m and k. 4) What is the utilization of this connection? (The utilization is deﬁned as A/R) A/R = A/P = m / (m+k) Question 7: Peak & average transmission rate 54 5) Which approach gives better performance? ● packet switching ● circuit switching ● both give the same performance Packet switching. When the peak is way higher than the average we get a very small utilization of the channel and therefore circuit switching is very inefﬁcient. Packet switching is more performant as it does not require to reserve the bandwidth of P during the whole connection. Assume that the ratio of P/A is large (≫1)","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
