Figure 1: Network topology Question 1.1 Which ports are not selected by the spanning tree algorithm? 1 Question 1.2 Assume that switch B1 suffers catastrophic failure. Indicate which ports are not selected by the spanning tree algorithm after the recovery process when a new tree has been formed. Question 2: Data Plane (Forwarding) Consider hosts A, C, E and switches S1 to S6 with empty forwarding tables ini- tially, connected as the figure below shows. The address of Sx is 00:00:00:00:00:0x. Figure 2: Network topology Question 2.1 Which links are removed after the completion of the spanning tree? Use the lowest switch address to break ties. Question 2.2 Backward Learning Fill in the forwarding table for each switch after each transmission. Assume that each transmission starts after the previous has finished and the forwarding tables have been updated. In the forwarding table, mark the port by the unique LAN 2 segment (e.g., La, Lc) reachable using that port or the label of the link (e.g., ℓ12, ℓ23) that is connected to that port. In each cell, write only the forwarding information that gets updated and not the whole forwarding table. We already filled out two entries for you. TransmissionS1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 A → E A at La A at ℓ12 E → A C → A Question 3: Encoding and Modulation Question 3.1 Multiple Choice: Which answers are correct? • In baseband modulation the bit stream is directly send onto the wire • In baseband modulation the bit stream is transmitted by sending a modu- lated carrier frequency signal • In passband modulation the bit stream is directly send onto the wire • In passband modulation the bit stream is transmitted by sending a modu- lated carrier frequency signal Question 3.2 Consider the binary message 1010 1110 0001 to be baseband encoded. Draw the message encoded using non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and non-return-to- zero-inverted (NRZI). You can assume that a high logic level maps to the bit 1 in non-return-to-zero, and that the signal starts at high logic level. Question 3.3 What is the message encoded using 4B5B? You might need the encoding table found here. Question 3.4 Draw the result from Question 3.3, encoded using non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and non-return-to-zero-inverted (NRZI). You can make the same assumptions again. Question 3.5 Compare the resulting signals from Question 3.1 and Question 3.3. Why is it beneficial to use 4B5B encoding? Are there any disadvantages? 3 Question 3.6 Match the following waveforms with their respective modulation forms. 1. Phase Key Shifting 2. Amplitude Key Shifting 3. NZR Signal of Bits 4. Frequency Key Shifting Question 4: Framing & Error Correction Question 4.1 The message 0110 0111 1110 0000 0111 1110 1111 1001 is to be transmit- ted. Show the bit sequence for the message if it is encoded using the following framing methods: 1. Flag bytes with byte stuffing (FLAG = 0111 1110, ESC = 1110 0000) 2. Starting and ending flag bits with bit stuffing (FLAG = 0111 1110) Question 4.2 A 32-bit message is transmitted using a Hamming code. How many check bits are needed to properly detect and correct 1-bit errors in this 32-bit message? 4 Question 4.3 You wish to transmit the frame containing 10010110010 with a CRC attached. Your generator polynomial is x3 + 1 and k = 3. What bit string would be transmitted? 5","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
