Each tile has microscopic wiring for up to four Accelerator Compute Die (XCD) tiles stacked on top, besides the 128- channel HBM3E memory controllers, 256 MB of Infinity Cache memory, the Infinity Fabric interfaces, and a PCI-Express 5.0 x16 root complex. 3. The XCDs are built on the 3 nm TSMC N3P foundry node. These contain a 4 MB L2 cache, and four shader engines, each with 9 compute units. Each XCD hence has 36 CU, and each IOD seats 144 CU. Two IODs are joined at the hip by a 5.5 TB/s bidirectional interconnect that enables full cache coherency among the two IODs. The package has a total of 288 CU. Each IOD controls four HBM3E stacks for 144 GB of memory, the package has 288 GB. Making a custom ASIC is expensive (more and more) ▪ You need large volume to justify this cost ▪ Alternatives ▪ Generic parts, CPUs, MCUs, GPUs ▪ FPGAs (in a moment) VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Business players in chip design and manufaturing ▪ IC Design business evolved over time ▪ Less Integrated Device Manufacturers ▪ Intel, Samsung, ST ▪ Work outsourced to specialized companies ▪ Manufacturing ▪ IP ▪ Verification Test ▪ Very complex supply chain!

Configure LUT by writing into a memory the truth table of logic function Configure SM by writing into a memory the IO connectivity The logic functions and connectivity are configured post fabrication (by writing memory cells) VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs 32Top-Down Digital VLSI Design: From Architectures to Gate-Level Circuits and FPGAs by Hubert Kaeslin FPGA vs. ASIC – Cost vs Volume ▪ FPGA ▪ Low NRE cost ▪ High unit cost ▪ ASIC ▪ High NRE cost ▪ Low unit cost ▪ At some point they cross ▪ Crossover depends on implementation VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
