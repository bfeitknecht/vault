Harris ©2007 Elsevier http://safari.ethz.ch/ddca Using Verilog for Testbenches Carnegie Mellon 2 What Will We Learn? ¢ How to simulate your circuit ¢ Applying inputs ¢ Seeing if the circuit does the correct thing Carnegie Mellon 3 How Do You Know That A Circuit Works? ¢ You have written the Verilog code of a circuit § Does it work correctly? § Even if the syntax is correct, it might do what you want? § What exactly it is that you want anyway? ¢ Trial and error can be costly § You need to ‘test’ your circuit in advance ¢ In modern digital designs, functional verification is the most time consuming design stage. Carnegie Mellon 4 The Idea Behind A Testbench ¢ Using a computer simulator to test your circuit § You instantiate your design § Supply the circuit with some inputs § See what it does § Does it return the “correct” outputs? Carnegie Mellon 5 Testbenches ¢ HDL code written to test another HDL module, the device under test (dut), also called the unit under test (uut) ¢ Not synthesizeable ¢ Types of testbenches: § Simple testbench § Self-checking testbench § Self-checking testbench with testvectors Carnegie Mellon 6 Example ¢ Write Verilog code to implement the following function in hardware: y = (b · c) + (a · b) ¢ Name the module sillyfunction Carnegie Mellon 7 Example module sillyfunction(input a, b, c, output y); assign y = ~b & ~c | a & ~b; endmodule ¢ Write Verilog code to implement the following function in hardware: y = (b · c) + (a · b) ¢ Name the module sillyfunction Carnegie Mellon 8 Simple Testbench module testbench1(); // Testbench has no inputs, outputs reg a, b, c; // Will be assigned in initial block wire y; // instantiate device under test sillyfunction dut (.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .y(y) );d // apply inputs one at a time initial begin // sequential block a = 0; b = 0; c = 0; #10; // apply inputs, wait 10ns c = 1; #10; // apply inputs, wait 10ns b = 1; c = 0; #10; // etc .. etc.. c = 1; #10; a = 1; b = 0; c = 0; #10; end endmodule Carnegie Mellon 9 Simple Testbench ¢ Simple testbench instantiates the design under test ¢ It applies a series of inputs ¢ The outputs have to be observed and compared using a simulator program. § This type of testbench does not help with the outputs ¢ initial statement is similar to always, it just starts once at the beginning, and does not repeat. ¢ The statements have to be blocking. Carnegie Mellon 10 Self-checking Testbench module testbench2(); reg a, b, c; wire y; // instantiate device under test sillyfunction dut(.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .y(y)); // apply inputs one at a time initial begin a = 0; b = 0; c = 0; #10; // apply input, wait if (y !== 1) $display(\"000 failed.\"); // check c = 1; #10; // apply input, wait if (y !== 0) $display(\"001 failed.\"); // check b = 1; c = 0; #10; // etc.. etc.. if (y !== 0) $display(\"010 failed.\"); // check end endmodule Carnegie Mellon 11 Self-checking Testbench ¢ Better than simple testbench ¢ This testbench also includes a statement to check the current state ¢ $display will write a message in the simulator ¢ This is a lot of work § Imagine a 32-bit processor executing a program (thousands of clock cycles) ¢ You make the same amount of mistakes when writing testbenches as you do writing actual code Carnegie Mellon 12 Testbench with Testvectors ¢ The more elaborate testbench ¢ Write testvector file: inputs and expected outputs § Usually can use a high-level model (golden model) to produce the ‘correct’ input output vectors ¢ Testbench: § Generate clock for assigning inputs, reading outputs § Read testvectors file into array § Assign inputs, get expected outputs from DUT § Compare outputs to expected outputs and report errors Carnegie Mellon 13 Testbench with Testvectors ¢ A testbench clock is used to synchronize I/O § The same clock can be used for the DUT clock ¢ Inputs are applied following a hold margin ¢ Outputs are sampled before the next clock edge § The example in book uses the falling clock edge to sample Apply inputs after some delay from the clock Check outputs before the next clock edge Clock period HOLD MARGIN SETUP MARGIN Carnegie Mellon 14 Testvectors File ¢ We need to generate a testvector file (somehow) ¢ File: example.tv – contains vectors of abc_yexpected 000_1 001_0 010_0 011_0 100_1 101_1 110_0 111_0 Carnegie Mellon 15 Testbench: 1. Generate Clock module testbench3(); reg clk, reset; // clock and reset are internal reg a, b, c, yexpected; // values from testvectors wire y; // output of circuit reg [31:0] vectornum, errors; // bookkeeping variables reg [3:0] testvectors[10000:0];// array of testvectors // instantiate device under test sillyfunction dut(.a(a), .b(b), .c(c), .y(y) ); // generate clock always // no sensitivity list, so it always executes begin clk = 1; #5; clk = 0; #5; // 10ns period end Carnegie Mellon 16 2. Read Testvectors into Array // at start of test, load vectors // and pulse reset initial // Will execute at the beginning once begin $readmemb(\"example.tv\", testvectors); // Read vectors vectornum = 0; errors = 0; // Initialize reset = 1; #27; reset = 0; // Apply reset wait end // Note: $readmemh reads testvector files written in // hexadecimal Carnegie Mellon 17 3. Assign Inputs and Expected Outputs // apply test vectors on rising edge of clk always @(posedge clk) begin #1; {a, b, c, yexpected} = testvectors[vectornum]; end ¢ Apply inputs with some delay (1ns) AFTER clock ¢ This is important § Inputs should not change at the same time with clock ¢ Ideal circuits (HDL code) are immune, but real circuits (netlists) may suffer from hold violations. Carnegie Mellon 18 4. Compare Outputs with Expected Outputs // check results on falling edge of clk always @(negedge clk) if (~reset) // skip during reset begin if (y !== yexpected) begin $display(\"Error: inputs = %b\", {a, b, c}); $display(\" outputs = %b (%b exp)\",y,yexpected); errors = errors + 1; end // Note: to print in hexadecimal, use %h. For example, // $display(“Error: inputs = %h”, {a, b, c}); Carnegie Mellon 19 4. Compare Outputs with Expected Outputs // increment array index and read next testvector vectornum = vectornum + 1; if (testvectors[vectornum] === 4'bx) begin $display(\"%d tests completed with %d errors\", vectornum, errors); $finish; // End simulation end end endmodule // Note: === and !== can compare values that are // x or z. Carnegie Mellon 20 Golden Models ¢ A golden model represents the ideal behavior of your circuit. § Still it has to be developed § It is difficult to get it right (bugs in the golden model!) § Can be done in C, Perl, Python, Matlab or even in Verilog ¢ The behavior of the circuit is compared against this golden model. § Allows automated systems (very important) Carnegie Mellon 21 Why is Verification difficult? ¢ How long would it take to test a 32-bit adder? § In such an adder there are 64 inputs = 264 possible inputs § That makes around 1.85 1019 possibilities § If you test one input in 1ns, you can test 109 inputs per second § or 8.64 x 1014 inputs per day § or 3.15 x 1017 inputs per year § we would still need 58.5 years to test all possibilities ¢ Brute force testing is not feasible for all circuits, we need alternatives § Formal verification methods § Choosing ‘critical cases’ § Not an easy task Carnegie Mellon 22 What did we learn? ¢ Verilog has other uses than modeling hardware § It can be used for creating testbenches ¢ Three main classes of testbenches § Applying only inputs, manual observation (not a good idea) § Applying and checking results with inline code (cumbersome) § Using testvector files (good for automatization)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
