Exercises that are marked by ∗ are challenge exercises. ‚ey do not count towards bonus points. You can use results from previous parts without solving those parts. Exercise 1.1 Guess the formula (1 point). Consider the recursive formula deﬁned by a1 = 2 and an+1 = 3an − 2 for n > 1. Find a simple closed formula for an and prove that an follows it using mathematical induction. Hint: Write out the ﬁrst few terms. How fast does the sequence grow? Exercise 1.2 Sum of Cubes (1 point). Prove by mathematical induction that for every positive integer n, 13 + 23 + · · · + n3 = n2(n + 1)2 4 . Exercise 1.3 Sums of powers of integers. In this exercise, we ﬁx an integer k ∈ N0. (a) Show that, for all n ∈ N0, we have ∑n i=1 ik ≤ nk+1. (b) Show that for all n ∈ N0, we have ∑n i=1 ik ≥ 1 2k+1 · nk+1. Hint: Consider the second half of the sum, i.e., ∑n i=⌈ n 2 ⌉ ik. How many terms are there in this sum? How small can they be? Together, these two inequalities show that C1 · nk+1 ≤ ∑n i=1 ik ≤ C2 · nk+1, where C1 = 1 2k+1 and C2 = 1 are two constants independent of n. Hence, when n is large, ∑n i=1 ik behaves “almost like nk+1” up to a constant factor. Exercise 1.4 Asymptotic growth (1 point). Recall the concept of asymptotic growth that we introduced in Exercise sheet 0: If f, g : N → R+ are two functions, then: • We say that f grows asymptotically slower than g if lim m→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0. If this is the case, we also say that g grows asymptotically faster than f . Prove or disprove each of the following statements. (a) f (m) = 10m3 − m2 grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 100m3. (b) f (m) = 100 · m2 log(m) + 10 · m3 grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 5 · m3 log(m). Hint: log(m) grows asymptotically slower than m. (c) f (m) = log (m) grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = log (m4). (d) f (m) = 2(0.9m2+m) grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 2(m2). (e) If f grows asymptotically slower than g, and g grows asymptotically slower than h, then f grows asymptotically slower than h. Hint: For any a, b : N → R+, if lim m→∞a(m) = A and lim m→∞b(m) = B, then lim m→∞ a(m)b(m) = AB. (f) If f grows asymptotically slower than g, and h : N → N grows asymptotically faster than 1, then f grows asymptotically slower than g(h(m)). Exercise 1.5 Proving Inequalities. (a) By induction, prove the inequality 1 2 · 3 4 · 5 6 · . . . · 2n − 1 2n ≤ 1 √3n + 1 , n ≥ 1. (b)* Replace 3n + 1 by 3n on the right side, and try to prove the new inequality by induction. ‚is inequality is even weaker, hence it must be true. However, the induction proof fails. Try to explain to yourself how is this possible? 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
