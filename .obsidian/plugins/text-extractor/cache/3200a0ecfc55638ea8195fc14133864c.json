Thisenables us to model motion in space, eﬃciently compute with big data and muchmore. Thus, linear algebra is a powerful tool for abstraction in many diﬀerentareas of math, computer science and engineering.LecturesW00 vectorshow to operate on vectors (vector addition, scalar multiplication)Lecture Plan W01 linear combinationscalar producttriangle inequality, cauchy-schwarz inequalitylinear independenceLecture Plan W02 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w02.pdf” could not be found.W03 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w03.pdf” could not be found.W04 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w04.pdf” could not be found.W05 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w05.pdf” could not be found.W06 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w06.pdf” could not be found.W07 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w07.pdf” could not be found.W08 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w08.pdf” could not be found.W09 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w09.pdf” could not be found.W10 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w10.pdf” could not be found.W11 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w11.pdf” could not be found.W12 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w12.pdf” could not be found.W13 Lecture Plan “LinAlg-plan-w13.pdf” could not be found.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
