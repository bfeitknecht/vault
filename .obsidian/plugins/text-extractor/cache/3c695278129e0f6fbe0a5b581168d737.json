To apply Markov's inequality, \\Pr[\\mathrm{X} \\geq t]&nbsp;\\leq \\frac {\\mathbb E[\\mathrm{X}]} t, we need the expected value , meaning the expected number of streets with ﬂowers encountered. For this, we can use linearity of expectation, since the probability for a street to have ﬂowers is binomially distributed. Hence, (b) Using Chebyshev's inequality, , requires . This is given by , as . (c) Let , where with , independent. Let . The probability, for some -th dog to sniﬄe all day is , given by all of its trip's streets having ﬂowers. Thus, . The expected number of sniﬄing dogs is given by ~ We want this probability o Pr[X-E] = - 0 : - Y-- - Small mistake : You have n- t friends but your dog counts too making u in total . Not a critical mistake though : Now, we need to show that . (d) Let , where with , independent denoting, whether the -th trip was a disaster. We know, that the probability, for any one trip to be a disaster is . Thus, . We need to show that . Let \"i always ﬁnd it therefore i never search\" ~ = good approach , but we need a better band (Chemoff) X Yo u didn't prove what needed to be proven . At least I don't see it.
