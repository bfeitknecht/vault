With computers having become prevalent in our modern lives, however, the term is no longer esoteric. If you look around your home, you’ll ûnd algorithms running in the most mundane places: your microwave oven, your washing machine, and, of course, your computer. You ask algorithms to make recommendations to you: what music you might like or what route to take when driving. Our society, for better or for worse, asks algorithms to suggest sentences for convicted criminals. You even rely on algorithms to keep you alive, or at least not to kill you: the control systems in your car or in medical equipment. 1 The word <algorithm= appears somewhere in the news seemingly every day. Therefore, it behooves you to understand algorithms not just as a student or practitioner of computer science, but as a citizen of the world. Once you understand algorithms, you can educate others about what algorithms are, how they operate, and what their limitations are. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of com- puter algorithms. It presents many algorithms and covers them in considerable depth, yet makes their design accessible to all levels of readers. All the analyses are laid out, some simple, some more involved. We have tried to keep explanations clear without sacriûcing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. Each chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a related topic. Algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The book contains 231 ûgures4many with multiple parts4illustrating how the algorithms work. Since we emphasize efﬁciency as a design criterion, we include careful analyses of the running times of the algorithms. 1 To understand many of the ways in which algorithms inüuence our daily lives, see the book by Fry [162]. xiv Preface The text is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms or data structures. Because it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design, as well as mathematical aspects, it is equally well suited for self-study by technical professionals. In this, the fourth edition, we have once again updated the entire book. The changes cover a broad spectrum, including new chapters and sections, color illus- trations, and what we hope you’ll ûnd to be a more engaging writing style. To the teacher We have designed this book to be both versatile and complete. You should ûnd it useful for a variety of courses, from an undergraduate course in data structures up through a graduate course in algorithms. Because we have provided considerably more material than can ût in a typical one-term course, you can select the material that best supports the course you wish to teach. You should ûnd it easy to organize your course around just the chapters you need. We have made chapters relatively self-contained, so that you need not worry about an unexpected and unnecessary dependence of one chapter on an- other. Whereas in an undergraduate course, you might use only some sections from a chapter, in a graduate course, you might cover the entire chapter. We have included 931 exercises and 162 problems. Each section ends with exer- cises, and each chapter ends with problems. The exercises are generally short ques- tions that test basic mastery of the material. Some are simple self-check thought exercises, but many are substantial and suitable as assigned homework. The prob- lems include more elaborate case studies which often introduce new material. They often consist of several parts that lead the student through the steps required to ar- rive at a solution. As with the third edition of this book, we have made publicly available solutions to some, but by no means all, of the problems and exercises. You can ûnd these so- lutions on our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/. You will want to check this site to see whether it contains the solution to an exercise or problem that you plan to assign. Since the set of solutions that we post might grow over time, we recommend that you check the site each time you teach the course. We have starred (?) the sections and exercises that are more suitable for graduate students than for undergraduates. A starred section is not necessarily more difû- cult than an unstarred one, but it may require an understanding of more advanced mathematics. Likewise, starred exercises may require an advanced background or more than average creativity. Preface xv To the student We hope that this textbook provides you with an enjoyable introduction to the ûeld of algorithms. We have attempted to make every algorithm accessible and inter- esting. To help you when you encounter unfamiliar or difûcult algorithms, we describe each one in a step-by-step manner. We also provide careful explanations of the mathematics needed to understand the analysis of the algorithms and sup- porting ûgures to help you visualize what is going on. Since this book is large, your class will probably cover only a portion of its material. Although we hope that you will ûnd this book helpful to you as a course textbook now, we have also tried to make it comprehensive enough to warrant space on your future professional bookshelf. What are the prerequisites for reading this book?  You need some programming experience. In particular, you should understand recursive procedures and simple data structures, such as arrays and linked lists (although Section 10.2 covers linked lists and a variant that you may ûnd new).  You should have some facility with mathematical proofs, and especially proofs by mathematical induction. A few portions of the book rely on some knowledge of elementary calculus. Although this book uses mathematics throughout, Part I and Appendices A–D teach you all the mathematical techniques you will need. Our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, links to solutions for some of the problems and exercises. Feel free to check your solutions against ours. We ask, however, that you not send your solutions to us. To the professional The wide range of topics in this book makes it an excellent handbook on algo- rithms. Because each chapter is relatively self-contained, you can focus on the topics most relevant to you. Since most of the algorithms we discuss have great practical utility, we address implementation concerns and other engineering issues. We often provide practical alternatives to the few algorithms that are primarily of theoretical interest. If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should ûnd the transla- tion of our pseudocode into your favorite programming language to be a fairly straightforward task. We have designed the pseudocode to present each algorithm clearly and succinctly. Consequently, we do not address error handling and other software-engineering issues that require speciûc assumptions about your program- ming environment. We attempt to present each algorithm simply and directly with- out allowing the idiosyncrasies of a particular programming language to obscure its essence. If you are used to 0-origin arrays, you might ûnd our frequent practice of xvi Preface indexing arrays from 1 a minor stumbling block. You can always either subtract 1 from our indices or just overallocate the array and leave position 0 unused. We understand that if you are using this book outside of a course, then you might be unable to check your solutions to problems and exercises against solutions provided by an instructor. Our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, links to solutions for some of the problems and exercises so that you can check your work. Please do not send your solutions to us. To our colleagues We have supplied an extensive bibliography and pointers to the current literature. Each chapter ends with a set of chapter notes that give historical details and ref- erences. The chapter notes do not provide a complete reference to the whole ûeld of algorithms, however. Though it may be hard to believe for a book of this size, space constraints prevented us from including many interesting algorithms. Despite myriad requests from students for solutions to problems and exercises, we have adopted the policy of not citing references for them, removing the temp- tation for students to look up a solution rather than to discover it themselves. Changes for the fourth edition As we said about the changes for the second and third editions, depending on how you look at it, the book changed either not much or quite a bit. A quick look at the table of contents shows that most of the third-edition chapters and sections appear in the fourth edition. We removed three chapters and several sections, but we have added three new chapters and several new sections apart from these new chapters. We kept the hybrid organization from the ûrst three editions. Rather than organizing chapters only by problem domains or only according to techniques, this book incorporates elements of both. It contains technique-based chapters on divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analy- sis, augmenting data structures, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. But it also has entire parts on sorting, on data structures for dynamic sets, and on algorithms for graph problems. We ûnd that although you need to know how to ap- ply techniques for designing and analyzing algorithms, problems seldom announce to you which techniques are most amenable to solving them. Some of the changes in the fourth edition apply generally across the book, and some are speciûc to particular chapters or sections. Here is a summary of the most signiûcant general changes:  We added 140 new exercises and 22 new problems. We also improved many of the old exercises and problems, often as the result of reader feedback. (Thanks to all readers who made suggestions.) Preface xvii  We have color! With designers from the MIT Press, we selected a limited palette, devised to convey information and to be pleasing to the eye. (We are delighted to display red-black trees in4get this4red and black!) To enhance readability, deûned terms, pseudocode comments, and page numbers in the in- dex are in color.  Pseudocode procedures appear on a tan background to make them easier to spot, and they do not necessarily appear on the page of their ûrst reference. When they don’t, the text directs you to the relevant page. In the same vein, nonlocal references to numbered equations, theorems, lemmas, and corollaries include the page number.  We removed topics that were rarely taught. We dropped in their entirety the chapters on Fibonacci heaps, van Emde Boas trees, and computational geom- etry. In addition, the following material was excised: the maximum-subarray problem, implementing pointers and objects, perfect hashing, randomly built binary search trees, matroids, push-relabel algorithms for maximum üow, the iterative fast Fourier transform method, the details of the simplex algorithm for linear programming, and integer factorization. You can ûnd all the removed material on our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/.  We reviewed the entire book and rewrote sentences, paragraphs, and sections to make the writing clearer, more personal, and gender neutral. For example, the <traveling-salesman problem= in the previous editions is now called the <traveling-salesperson problem.= We believe that it is critically important for engineering and science, including our own ûeld of computer science, to be welcoming to everyone. (The one place that stumped us is in Chapter 13, which requires a term for a parent’s sibling. Because the English language has no such gender-neutral term, we regretfully stuck with <uncle.=)  The chapter notes, bibliography, and index were updated, reüecting the dra- matic growth of the ûeld of algorithms since the third edition.  We corrected errors, posting most corrections on our website of third-edition errata. Those that were reported while we were in full swing preparing this edition were not posted, but were corrected in this edition. (Thanks again to all readers who helped us identify issues.) The speciûc changes for the fourth edition include the following:  We renamed Chapter 3 and added a section giving an overview of asymptotic notation before delving into the formal deûnitions.  Chapter 4 underwent substantial changes to improve its mathematical founda- tion and make it more robust and intuitive. The notion of an algorithmic re- currence was introduced, and the topic of ignoring üoors and ceilings in recur- xviii Preface rences was addressed more rigorously. The second case of the master theorem incorporates polylogarithmic factors, and a rigorous proof of a <continuous= version of the master theorem is now provided. We also present the powerful and general Akra-Bazzi method (without proof).  The deterministic order-statistic algorithm in Chapter 9 is slightly different, and the analyses of both the randomized and deterministic order-statistic algorithms have been revamped.  In addition to stacks and queues, Section 10.1 discusses ways to store arrays and matrices.  Chapter 11 on hash tables includes a modern treatment of hash functions. It also emphasizes linear probing as an efûcient method for resolving collisions when the underlying hardware implements caching to favor local searches.  To replace the sections on matroids in Chapter 15, we converted a problem in the third edition about ofüine caching into a full section.  Section 16.4 now contains a more intuitive explanation of the potential func- tions to analyze table doubling and halving.  Chapter 17 on augmenting data structures was relocated from Part III to Part V, reüecting our view that this technique goes beyond basic material.  Chapter 25 is a new chapter about matchings in bipartite graphs. It presents algorithms to ûnd a matching of maximum cardinality, to solve the stable- marriage problem, and to ûnd a maximum-weight matching (known as the <as- signment problem=).  Chapter 26, on task-parallel computing, has been updated with modern termi- nology, including the name of the chapter.  Chapter 27, which covers online algorithms, is another new chapter. In an online algorithm, the input arrives over time, rather than being available in its entirety at the start of the algorithm. The chapter describes several examples of online algorithms, including determining how long to wait for an elevator before taking the stairs, maintaining a linked list via the move-to-front heuristic, and evaluating replacement policies for caches.  In Chapter 29, we removed the detailed presentation of the simplex algorithm, as it was math heavy without really conveying many algorithmic ideas. The chapter now focuses on the key aspect of how to model problems as linear programs, along with the essential duality property of linear programming.  Section 32.5 adds to the chapter on string matching the simple, yet powerful, structure of sufûx arrays. Preface xix  Chapter 33, on machine learning, is the third new chapter. It introduces sev- eral basic methods used in machine learning: clustering to group similar items together, weighted-majority algorithms, and gradient descent to ûnd the mini- mizer of a function.  Section 34.5.6 summarizes strategies for polynomial-time reductions to show that problems are NP-hard.  The proof of the approximation algorithm for the set-covering problem in Sec- tion 35.3 has been revised. Website You can use our website, http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms/, to obtain supplemen- tary information and to communicate with us. The website links to a list of known errors, material from the third edition that is not included in the fourth edition, solutions to selected exercises and problems, Python implementations of many of the algorithms in this book, a list explaining the corny professor jokes (of course), as well as other content, which we may add to. The website also tells you how to report errors or make suggestions. How we produced this book Like the previous three editions, the fourth edition was produced in L A T E X 2 \" . We used the Times font with mathematics typeset using the MathTime Professional II fonts. As in all previous editions, we compiled the index using Windex, a C pro- gram that we wrote, and produced the bibliography using B IBT E X. The PDF ûles for this book were created on a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14. Our plea to Apple in the preface of the third edition to update MacDraw Pro for macOS 10 went for naught, and so we continued to draw illustrations on pre-Intel Macs running MacDraw Pro under the Classic environment of older versions of macOS 10. Many of the mathematical expressions appearing in illustrations were laid in with the psfrag package for L A T E X 2 \" . Acknowledgments for the fourth edition We have been working with the MIT Press since we started writing the ûrst edi- tion in 1987, collaborating with several directors, editors, and production staff. Throughout our association with the MIT Press, their support has always been out- standing. Special thanks to our editors Marie Lee, who put up with us for far too long, and Elizabeth Swayze, who pushed us over the ûnish line. Thanks also to Director Amy Brand and to Alex Hoopes. xx Preface As in the third edition, we were geographically distributed while producing the fourth edition, working in the Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science; the MIT Computer Science and Artiûcial Intelligence Laboratory and the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; and the Columbia University Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Re- search, Department of Computer Science, and Data Science Institute. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked largely from home. We thank our respective universities and colleagues for providing such supportive and stimulating environ- ments. As we complete this book, those of us who are not retired are eager to return to our respective universities now that the pandemic seems to be abating. Julie Sussman, P.P.A., came to our rescue once again with her technical copy- editing under tremendous time pressure. If not for Julie, this book would be riddled with errors (or, let’s say, many more errors than it has) and would be far less read- able. Julie, we will be forever indebted to you. Errors that remain are the responsi- bility of the authors (and probably were inserted after Julie read the material). Dozens of errors in previous editions were corrected in the process of creating this edition. We thank our readers4too many to list them all4who have reported errors and suggested improvements over the years. We received considerable help in preparing some of the new material in this edition. Neville Campbell (unafûliated), Bill Kuszmaul of MIT, and Chee Yap of NYU provided valuable advice regarding the treatment of recurrences in Chapter 4. Yan Gu of the University of California, Riverside, provided feedback on parallel algorithms in Chapter 26. Rob Shapire of Microsoft Research altered our approach to the material on machine learning with his detailed comments on Chapter 33. Qi Qi of MIT helped with the analysis of the Monty Hall problem (Problem C-1). Molly Seaman and Mary Reilly of the MIT Press helped us select the color palette in the illustrations, and Wojciech Jarosz of Dartmouth College suggested design improvements to our newly colored ûgures. Yichen (Annie) Ke and Linda Xiao, who have since graduated from Dartmouth, aided in colorizing the illus- trations, and Linda also produced many of the Python implementations that are available on the book’s website. Finally, we thank our wives4Wendy Leiserson, Gail Rivest, Rebecca Ivry, and the late Nicole Cormen4and our families. The patience and encouragement of those who love us made this project possible. We affectionately dedicate this book to them. THOMAS H. CORMEN Lebanon, New Hampshire CHARLES E. LEISERSON Cambridge, Massachusetts RONALD L. RIVEST Cambridge, Massachusetts CLIFFORD STEIN New York, New York June, 2021 Part I Foundations Introduction When you design and analyze algorithms, you need to be able to describe how they operate and how to design them. You also need some mathematical tools to show that your algorithms do the right thing and do it efûciently. This part will get you started. Later parts of this book will build upon this base. Chapter 1 provides an overview of algorithms and their place in modern com- puting systems. This chapter deûnes what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also makes a case for considering algorithms as a technology, alongside tech- nologies such as fast hardware, graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks. In Chapter 2, we see our ûrst algorithms, which solve the problem of sorting a sequence of n numbers. They are written in a pseudocode which, although not directly translatable to any conventional programming language, conveys the struc- ture of the algorithm clearly enough that you should be able to implement it in the language of your choice. The sorting algorithms we examine are insertion sort, which uses an incremental approach, and merge sort, which uses a recursive tech- nique known as <divide-and-conquer.= Although the time each requires increases with the value of n, the rate of increase differs between the two algorithms. We determine these running times in Chapter 2, and we develop a useful <asymptotic= notation to express them. Chapter 3 precisely deûnes asymptotic notation. We’ll use asymptotic notation to bound the growth of functions4most often, functions that describe the running time of algorithms4from above and below. The chapter starts by informally deûn- ing the most commonly used asymptotic notations and giving an example of how to apply them. It then formally deûnes ûve asymptotic notations and presents conven- tions for how to put them together. The rest of Chapter 3 is primarily a presentation of mathematical notation, more to ensure that your use of notation matches that in this book than to teach you new mathematical concepts. 4 Part I Foundations Chapter 4 delves further into the divide-and-conquer method introduced in Chapter 2. It provides two additional examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms for multiplying square matrices, including Strassen’s surprising method. Chapter 4 contains methods for solving recurrences, which are useful for describing the run- ning times of recursive algorithms. In the substitution method, you guess an answer and prove it correct. Recursion trees provide one way to generate a guess. Chap- ter 4 also presents the powerful technique of the <master method,= which you can often use to solve recurrences that arise from divide-and-conquer algorithms. Al- though the chapter provides a proof of a foundational theorem on which the master theorem depends, you should feel free to employ the master method without delv- ing into the proof. Chapter 4 concludes with some advanced topics. Chapter 5 introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. You typically use probabilistic analysis to determine the running time of an algorithm in cases in which, due to the presence of an inherent probability distribution, the running time may differ on different inputs of the same size. In some cases, you might assume that the inputs conform to a known probability distribution, so that you are averaging the running time over all possible inputs. In other cases, the probability distribution comes not from the inputs but from random choices made during the course of the algorithm. An algorithm whose behavior is determined not only by its input but by the values produced by a random-number generator is a randomized algorithm. You can use randomized algorithms to enforce a probability distribution on the inputs4thereby ensuring that no particular input always causes poor performance4or even to bound the error rate of algorithms that are allowed to produce incorrect results on a limited basis. Appendices A–D contain other mathematical material that you will ûnd helpful as you read this book. You might have seen much of the material in the appendix chapters before having read this book (although the speciûc deûnitions and nota- tional conventions we use may differ in some cases from what you have seen in the past), and so you should think of the appendices as reference material. On the other hand, you probably have not already seen most of the material in Part I. All the chapters in Part I and the appendices are written with a tutorial üavor. 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing What are algorithms? Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile? What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers? This chapter will answer these questions. 1.1 Algorithms Informally, an algorithm is any well-deûned computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in a ûnite amount of time. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output. You can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-speciûed computa- tional problem. The statement of the problem speciûes in general terms the desired input/output relationship for problem instances, typically of arbitrarily large size. The algorithm describes a speciûc computational procedure for achieving that in- put/output relationship for all problem instances. As an example, suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into mono- tonically increasing order. This problem arises frequently in practice and provides fertile ground for introducing many standard design techniques and analysis tools. Here is how we formally deûne the sorting problem: Input: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i. Output: A permutation (reordering) ha 0 1 ; a 0 2 ; : : : ; a 0 n i of the input sequence such that a 0 1 හ a 0 2 හ    හ a 0 n . Thus, given the input sequence h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i, a correct sorting algorithm returns as output the sequence h26; 31; 41; 41; 58; 59i. Such an input sequence is 6 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing called an instance of the sorting problem. In general, an instance of a problem 1 consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem. Because many programs use it as an intermediate step, sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. As a result, you have a large number of good sort- ing algorithms at your disposal. Which algorithm is best for a given application depends on4among other factors4the number of items to be sorted, the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item values, the architecture of the computer, and the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory, disks, or even4archaically4tapes. An algorithm for a computational problem is correct if, for every problem in- stance provided as input, it halts4ûnishes its computing in ûnite time4and out- puts the correct solution to the problem instance. A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer. Contrary to what you might expect, incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if you can control their error rate. We’ll see an example of an algorithm with a controllable error rate in Chapter 31 when we study algorithms for ûnding large prime numbers. Ordi- narily, however, we’ll concern ourselves only with correct algorithms. An algorithm can be speciûed in English, as a computer program, or even as a hardware design. The only requirement is that the speciûcation must provide a precise description of the computational procedure to be followed. What kinds of problems are solved by algorithms? Sorting is by no means the only computational problem for which algorithms have been developed. (You probably suspected as much when you saw the size of this book.) Practical applications of algorithms are ubiquitous and include the follow- ing examples: The Human Genome Project has made great progress toward the goals of iden- tifying all the roughly 30,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequences of the roughly 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA, stor- ing this information in databases, and developing tools for data analysis. Each of these steps requires sophisticated algorithms. Although the solutions to the various problems involved are beyond the scope of this book, many methods to solve these biological problems use ideas presented here, enabling scientists to accomplish tasks while using resources efûciently. Dynamic programming, as 1 Sometimes, when the problem context is known, problem instances are themselves simply called <problems.= 1.1 Algorithms 7 in Chapter 14, is an important technique for solving several of these biological problems, particularly ones that involve determining similarity between DNA sequences. The savings realized are in time, both human and machine, and in money, as more information can be extracted by laboratory techniques.  The internet enables people all around the world to quickly access and retrieve large amounts of information. With the aid of clever algorithms, sites on the internet are able to manage and manipulate this large volume of data. Exam- ples of problems that make essential use of algorithms include ûnding good routes on which the data travels (techniques for solving such problems appear in Chapter 22), and using a search engine to quickly ûnd pages on which par- ticular information resides (related techniques are in Chapters 11 and 32).  Electronic commerce enables goods and services to be negotiated and ex- changed electronically, and it depends on the privacy of personal informa- tion such as credit card numbers, passwords, and bank statements. The core technologies used in electronic commerce include public-key cryptography and digital signatures (covered in Chapter 31), which are based on numerical algo- rithms and number theory.  Manufacturing and other commercial enterprises often need to allocate scarce resources in the most beneûcial way. An oil company might wish to know where to place its wells in order to maximize its expected proût. A political candidate might want to determine where to spend money buying campaign ad- vertising in order to maximize the chances of winning an election. An airline might wish to assign crews to üights in the least expensive way possible, mak- ing sure that each üight is covered and that government regulations regarding crew scheduling are met. An internet service provider might wish to determine where to place additional resources in order to serve its customers more effec- tively. All of these are examples of problems that can be solved by modeling them as linear programs, which Chapter 29 explores. Although some of the details of these examples are beyond the scope of this book, we do give underlying techniques that apply to these problems and problem areas. We also show how to solve many speciûc problems, including the following:  You have a road map on which the distance between each pair of adjacent in- tersections is marked, and you wish to determine the shortest route from one intersection to another. The number of possible routes can be huge, even if you disallow routes that cross over themselves. How can you choose which of all possible routes is the shortest? You can start by modeling the road map (which is itself a model of the actual roads) as a graph (which we will meet in Part VI and Appendix B). In this graph, you wish to ûnd the shortest path from one vertex to another. Chapter 22 shows how to solve this problem efûciently. 8 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing  Given a mechanical design in terms of a library of parts, where each part may include instances of other parts, list the parts in order so that each part appears before any part that uses it. If the design comprises n parts, then there are nŠ possible orders, where nŠ denotes the factorial function. Because the factorial function grows faster than even an exponential function, you cannot feasibly generate each possible order and then verify that, within that order, each part appears before the parts using it (unless you have only a few parts). This prob- lem is an instance of topological sorting, and Chapter 20 shows how to solve this problem efûciently.  A doctor needs to determine whether an image represents a cancerous tumor or a benign one. The doctor has available images of many other tumors, some of which are known to be cancerous and some of which are known to be benign. A cancerous tumor is likely to be more similar to other cancerous tumors than to benign tumors, and a benign tumor is more likely to be similar to other be- nign tumors. By using a clustering algorithm, as in Chapter 33, the doctor can identify which outcome is more likely.  You need to compress a large ûle containing text so that it occupies less space. Many ways to do so are known, including <LZW compression,= which looks for repeating character sequences. Chapter 15 studies a different approach, <Huff- man coding,= which encodes characters by bit sequences of various lengths, with characters occurring more frequently encoded by shorter bit sequences. These lists are far from exhaustive (as you again have probably surmised from this book’s heft), but they exhibit two characteristics common to many interesting algorithmic problems: 1. They have many candidate solutions, the overwhelming majority of which do not solve the problem at hand. Finding one that does, or one that is <best,= with- out explicitly examining each possible solution, can present quite a challenge. 2. They have practical applications. Of the problems in the above list, ûnding the shortest path provides the easiest examples. A transportation ûrm, such as a trucking or railroad company, has a ûnancial interest in ûnding shortest paths through a road or rail network because taking shorter paths results in lower labor and fuel costs. Or a routing node on the internet might need to ûnd the shortest path through the network in order to route a message quickly. Or a person wishing to drive from New York to Boston might want to ûnd driving directions using a navigation app. Not every problem solved by algorithms has an easily identiûed set of candi- date solutions. For example, given a set of numerical values representing samples of a signal taken at regular time intervals, the discrete Fourier transform converts 1.1 Algorithms 9 the time domain to the frequency domain. That is, it approximates the signal as a weighted sum of sinusoids, producing the strength of various frequencies which, when summed, approximate the sampled signal. In addition to lying at the heart of signal processing, discrete Fourier transforms have applications in data compres- sion and multiplying large polynomials and integers. Chapter 30 gives an efûcient algorithm, the fast Fourier transform (commonly called the FFT), for this problem. The chapter also sketches out the design of a hardware FFT circuit. Data structures This book also presents several data structures. A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modiûcations. Using the appro- priate data structure or structures is an important part of algorithm design. No sin- gle data structure works well for all purposes, and so you should know the strengths and limitations of several of them. Technique Although you can use this book as a <cookbook= for algorithms, you might some- day encounter a problem for which you cannot readily ûnd a published algorithm (many of the exercises and problems in this book, for example). This book will teach you techniques of algorithm design and analysis so that you can develop al- gorithms on your own, show that they give the correct answer, and analyze their ef- ûciency. Different chapters address different aspects of algorithmic problem solv- ing. Some chapters address speciûc problems, such as ûnding medians and order statistics in Chapter 9, computing minimum spanning trees in Chapter 21, and de- termining a maximum üow in a network in Chapter 24. Other chapters introduce techniques, such as divide-and-conquer in Chapters 2 and 4, dynamic programming in Chapter 14, and amortized analysis in Chapter 16. Hard problems Most of this book is about efûcient algorithms. Our usual measure of efûciency is speed: how long does an algorithm take to produce its result? There are some problems, however, for which we know of no algorithm that runs in a reasonable amount of time. Chapter 34 studies an interesting subset of these problems, which are known as NP-complete. Why are NP-complete problems interesting? First, although no efûcient algo- rithm for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven that an efûcient algorithm for one cannot exist. In other words, no one knows whether efûcient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems. Second, the set of 10 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efûcient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efûcient algorithms exist for all of them. This re- lationship among the NP-complete problems makes the lack of efûcient solutions all the more tantalizing. Third, several NP-complete problems are similar, but not identical, to problems for which we do know of efûcient algorithms. Computer scientists are intrigued by how a small change to the problem statement can cause a big change to the efûciency of the best known algorithm. You should know about NP-complete problems because some of them arise sur- prisingly often in real applications. If you are called upon to produce an efûcient algorithm for an NP-complete problem, you are likely to spend a lot of time in a fruitless search. If, instead, you can show that the problem is NP-complete, you can spend your time developing an efûcient approximation algorithm, that is, an algorithm that gives a good, but not necessarily the best possible, solution. As a concrete example, consider a delivery company with a central depot. Each day, it loads up delivery trucks at the depot and sends them around to deliver goods to several addresses. At the end of the day, each truck must end up back at the depot so that it is ready to be loaded for the next day. To reduce costs, the company wants to select an order of delivery stops that yields the lowest overall distance traveled by each truck. This problem is the well-known <traveling-salesperson problem,= and it is NP-complete. 2 It has no known efûcient algorithm. Under certain assumptions, however, we know of efûcient algorithms that compute overall distances close to the smallest possible. Chapter 35 discusses such <approximation algorithms.= Alternative computing models For many years, we could count on processor clock speeds increasing at a steady rate. Physical limitations present a fundamental roadblock to ever-increasing clock speeds, however: because power density increases superlinearly with clock speed, chips run the risk of melting once their clock speeds become high enough. In or- der to perform more computations per second, therefore, chips are being designed to contain not just one but several processing <cores.= We can liken these multi- core computers to several sequential computers on a single chip. In other words, they are a type of <parallel computer.= In order to elicit the best performance from multicore computers, we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind. Chapter 26 presents a model for =task-parallel= algorithms, which take advantage of multiple processing cores. This model has advantages from both theoretical and 2 To be precise, only decision problems4those with a <yes/no= answer4can be NP-complete. The decision version of the traveling salesperson problem asks whether there exists an order of stops whose distance totals at most a given amount. 1.1 Algorithms 11 practical standpoints, and many modern parallel-programming platforms embrace something similar to this model of parallelism. Most of the examples in this book assume that all of the input data are available when an algorithm begins running. Much of the work in algorithm design makes the same assumption. For many important real-world examples, however, the input actually arrives over time, and the algorithm must decide how to proceed without knowing what data will arrive in the future. In a data center, jobs are constantly arriving and departing, and a scheduling algorithm must decide when and where to run a job, without knowing what jobs will be arriving in the future. Trafûc must be routed in the internet based on the current state, without knowing about where trafûc will arrive in the future. Hospital emergency rooms make triage decisions about which patients to treat ûrst without knowing when other patients will be arriving in the future and what treatments they will need. Algorithms that receive their input over time, rather than having all the input present at the start, are online algorithms, which Chapter 27 examines. Exercises 1.1-1 Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires ûnding the shortest distance between two points. 1.1-2 Other than speed, what other measures of efûciency might you need to consider in a real-world setting? 1.1-3 Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations. 1.1-4 How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesperson problems given above similar? How are they different? 1.1-5 Suggest a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which <approximately= the best solution is good enough. 1.1-6 Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time. 12 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing 1.2 Algorithms as a technology If computers were inûnitely fast and computer memory were free, would you have any reason to study algorithms? The answer is yes, if for no other reason than that you would still like to be certain that your solution method terminates and does so with the correct answer. If computers were inûnitely fast, any correct method for solving a problem would do. You would probably want your implementation to be within the bounds of good software engineering practice (for example, your implementation should be well designed and documented), but you would most often use whichever method was the easiest to implement. Of course, computers may be fast, but they are not inûnitely fast. Computing time is therefore a bounded resource, which makes it precious. Although the saying goes, <Time is money,= time is even more valuable than money: you can get back money after you spend it, but once time is spent, you can never get it back. Memory may be inexpensive, but it is neither inûnite nor free. You should choose algorithms that use the resources of time and space efûciently. Efûciency Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efûciency. These differences can be much more signiûcant than differences due to hardware and software. As an example, Chapter 2 introduces two algorithms for sorting. The ûrst, known as insertion sort, takes time roughly equal to c 1 n 2 to sort n items, where c 1 is a constant that does not depend on n. That is, it takes time roughly proportional to n 2 . The second, merge sort, takes time roughly equal to c 2 n lg n, where lg n stands for log 2 n and c 2 is another constant that also does not depend on n. Inser- tion sort typically has a smaller constant factor than merge sort, so that c 1 < c 2 . We’ll see that the constant factors can have far less of an impact on the running time than the dependence on the input size n. Let’s write insertion sort’s running time as c 1 n  n and merge sort’s running time as c 2 n  lg n. Then we see that where insertion sort has a factor of n in its running time, merge sort has a factor of lg n, which is much smaller. For example, when n is 1000, lg n is approximately 10, and when n is 1,000,000, lg n is approximately only 20. Although insertion sort usu- ally runs faster than merge sort for small input sizes, once the input size n becomes large enough, merge sort’s advantage of lg n versus n more than compensates for the difference in constant factors. No matter how much smaller c 1 is than c 2 , there is always a crossover point beyond which merge sort is faster. 1.2 Algorithms as a technology 13 For a concrete example, let us pit a faster computer (computer A) running inser- tion sort against a slower computer (computer B) running merge sort. They each must sort an array of 10 million numbers. (Although 10 million numbers might seem like a lot, if the numbers are eight-byte integers, then the input occupies about 80 megabytes, which ûts in the memory of even an inexpensive laptop com- puter many times over.) Suppose that computer A executes 10 billion instructions per second (faster than any single sequential computer at the time of this writing) and computer B executes only 10 million instructions per second (much slower than most contemporary computers), so that computer A is 1000 times faster than computer B in raw computing power. To make the difference even more dramatic, suppose that the world’s craftiest programmer codes insertion sort in machine lan- guage for computer A, and the resulting code requires 2n 2 instructions to sort n numbers. Suppose further that just an average programmer implements merge sort, using a high-level language with an inefûcient compiler, with the resulting code taking 50 n lg n instructions. To sort 10 million numbers, computer A takes 2  .10 7 / 2 instructions 10 10 instructions/second D 20,000 seconds (more than 5:5 hours) ; while computer B takes 50  10 7 lg 10 7 instructions 10 7 instructions/second  1163 seconds (under 20 minutes) : By using an algorithm whose running time grows more slowly, even with a poor compiler, computer B runs more than 17 times faster than computer A! The ad- vantage of merge sort is even more pronounced when sorting 100 million numbers: where insertion sort takes more than 23 days, merge sort takes under four hours. Although 100 million might seem like a large number, there are more than 100 mil- lion web searches every half hour, more than 100 million emails sent every minute, and some of the smallest galaxies (known as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies) con- tain about 100 million stars. In general, as the problem size increases, so does the relative advantage of merge sort. Algorithms and other technologies The example above shows that you should consider algorithms, like computer hard- ware, as a technology. Total system performance depends on choosing efûcient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware. Just as rapid advances are being made in other computer technologies, they are being made in algorithms as well. You might wonder whether algorithms are truly that important on contemporary computers in light of other advanced technologies, such as 14 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing  advanced computer architectures and fabrication technologies,  easy-to-use, intuitive, graphical user interfaces (GUIs),  object-oriented systems,  integrated web technologies,  fast networking, both wired and wireless,  machine learning,  and mobile devices. The answer is yes. Although some applications do not explicitly require algorith- mic content at the application level (such as some simple, web-based applications), many do. For example, consider a web-based service that determines how to travel from one location to another. Its implementation would rely on fast hardware, a graphical user interface, wide-area networking, and also possibly on object ori- entation. It would also require algorithms for operations such as ûnding routes (probably using a shortest-path algorithm), rendering maps, and interpolating ad- dresses. Moreover, even an application that does not require algorithmic content at the application level relies heavily upon algorithms. Does the application rely on fast hardware? The hardware design used algorithms. Does the application rely on graphical user interfaces? The design of any GUI relies on algorithms. Does the application rely on networking? Routing in networks relies heavily on algorithms. Was the application written in a language other than machine code? Then it was processed by a compiler, interpreter, or assembler, all of which make extensive use of algorithms. Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contempo- rary computers. Machine learning can be thought of as a method for performing algorithmic tasks without explicitly designing an algorithm, but instead inferring patterns from data and thereby automatically learning a solution. At ûrst glance, machine learning, which automates the process of algorithmic design, may seem to make learning about algorithms obsolete. The opposite is true, however. Machine learning is itself a collection of algorithms, just under a different name. Furthermore, it cur- rently seems that the successes of machine learning are mainly for problems for which we, as humans, do not really understand what the right algorithm is. Promi- nent examples include computer vision and automatic language translation. For algorithmic problems that humans understand well, such as most of the problems in this book, efûcient algorithms designed to solve a speciûc problem are typically more successful than machine-learning approaches. Data science is an interdisciplinary ûeld with the goal of extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science uses methods Problems for Chapter 1 15 from statistics, computer science, and optimization. The design and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to the ûeld. The core techniques of data science, which overlap signiûcantly with those in machine learning, include many of the algo- rithms in this book. Furthermore, with the ever-increasing capacities of computers, we use them to solve larger problems than ever before. As we saw in the above comparison be- tween insertion sort and merge sort, it is at larger problem sizes that the differences in efûciency between algorithms become particularly prominent. Having a solid base of algorithmic knowledge and technique is one characteristic that deûnes the truly skilled programmer. With modern computing technology, you can accomplish some tasks without knowing much about algorithms, but with a good background in algorithms, you can do much, much more. Exercises 1.2-1 Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the applica- tion level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved. 1.2-2 Suppose that for inputs of size n on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in 8n 2 steps and merge sort runs in 64 n lg n steps. For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort? 1.2-3 What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n 2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2 n on the same machine? Problems 1-1 Comparison of running times For each function f .n/ and time t in the following table, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t , assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes f .n/ microseconds. 16 Chapter 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 second minute hour day month year century lg n p n n n lg n n 2 n 3 2 n nŠ Chapter notes There are many excellent texts on the general topic of algorithms, including those by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5, 6], Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani [107], Edmonds [133], Erickson [135], Goodrich and Tamassia [195, 196], Kleinberg and Tardos [257], Knuth [259, 260, 261, 262, 263], Levitin [298], Louridas [305], Mehlhorn and Sanders [325], Mitzenmacher and Upfal [331], Neapolitan [342], Roughgarden [385, 386, 387, 388], Sanders, Mehlhorn, Dietzfelbinger, and De- mentiev [393], Sedgewick and Wayne [402], Skiena [414], Soltys-Kulinicz [419], Wilf [455], and Williamson and Shmoys [459]. Some of the more practical as- pects of algorithm design are discussed by Bentley [49, 50, 51], Bhargava [54], Kochenderfer and Wheeler [268], and McGeoch [321]. Surveys of the ûeld of al- gorithms can also be found in books by Atallah and Blanton [27, 28] and Mehta and Sahhi [326].

It is self-contained, but it does include several references to material that will be introduced in Chapters 3 and 4. (It also contains several summations, which Appendix A shows how to solve.) We’ll begin by examining the insertion sort algorithm to solve the sorting prob- lem introduced in Chapter 1. We’ll specify algorithms using a pseudocode that should be understandable to you if you have done computer programming. We’ll see why insertion sort correctly sorts and analyze its running time. The analysis introduces a notation that describes how running time increases with the number of items to be sorted. Following a discussion of insertion sort, we’ll use a method called divide-and-conquer to develop a sorting algorithm called merge sort. We’ll end with an analysis of merge sort’s running time. 2.1 Insertion sort Our ûrst algorithm, insertion sort, solves the sorting problem introduced in Chap- ter 1: Input: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i. Output: A permutation (reordering) ha 0 1 ; a 0 2 ; : : : ; a 0 n i of the input sequence such that a 0 1 හ a 0 2 හ    හ a 0 n . The numbers to be sorted are also known as the keys. Although the problem is con- ceptually about sorting a sequence, the input comes in the form of an array with n elements. When we want to sort numbers, it’s often because they are the keys associated with other data, which we call satellite data. Together, a key and satel- lite data form a record. For example, consider a spreadsheet containing student records with many associated pieces of data such as age, grade-point average, and number of courses taken. Any one of these quantities could be a key, but when the 18 Chapter 2 Getting Started spreadsheet sorts, it moves the associated record (the satellite data) with the key. When describing a sorting algorithm, we focus on the keys, but it is important to remember that there usually is associated satellite data. In this book, we’ll typically describe algorithms as procedures written in a pseu- docode that is similar in many respects to C, C++, Java, Python, 1 or JavaScript. (Apologies if we’ve omitted your favorite programming language. We can’t list them all.) If you have been introduced to any of these languages, you should have little trouble understanding algorithms <coded= in pseudocode. What separates pseudocode from real code is that in pseudocode, we employ whatever expres- sive method is most clear and concise to specify a given algorithm. Sometimes the clearest method is English, so do not be surprised if you come across an En- glish phrase or sentence embedded within a section that looks more like real code. Another difference between pseudocode and real code is that pseudocode often ig- nores aspects of software engineering4such as data abstraction, modularity, and error handling4in order to convey the essence of the algorithm more concisely. We start with insertion sort, which is an efûcient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. Insertion sort works the way you might sort a hand of playing cards. Start with an empty left hand and the cards in a pile on the table. Pick up the ûrst card in the pile and hold it with your left hand. Then, with your right hand, remove one card at a time from the pile, and insert it into the correct position in your left hand. As Figure 2.1 illustrates, you ûnd the correct position for a card by comparing it with each of the cards already in your left hand, starting at the right and moving left. As soon as you see a card in your left hand whose value is less than or equal to the card you’re holding in your right hand, insert the card that you’re holding in your right hand just to the right of this card in your left hand. If all the cards in your left hand have values greater than the card in your right hand, then place this card as the leftmost card in your left hand. At all times, the cards held in your left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of the pile on the table. The pseudocode for insertion sort is given as the procedure I NSERTION-SORT on the facing page. It takes two parameters: an array A containing the values to be sorted and the number n of values of sort. The values occupy positions AŒ1� through AŒn� of the array, which we denote by AŒ1 W n�. When the I NSERTION- SORT procedure is ûnished, array AŒ1 W n� contains the original values, but in sorted order. 1 If you’re familiar with only Python, you can think of arrays as similar to Python lists. 2.1 Insertion sort 19 2 ♥ ♥ ♥ 2 ♥ 4 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ 4 ♥ 5 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥♥ 5 ♥ ♥ 7 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥♥ 7 ♥ ♥ 10 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥♥ ♥♥ 10 ♥ Figure 2.1 Sorting a hand of cards using insertion sort.

The index i indicates the <current card= being inserted into the hand. At the beginning of each iteration of the for loop, which is indexed by i , the subarray (a contiguous portion of the array) consisting of elements AŒ1 W i  1� (that is, AŒ1� through AŒi  1�) constitutes the currently sorted hand, and the remaining subarray AŒi C 1 W n� (elements AŒi C 1� through AŒn�) corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table. In fact, elements AŒ1 W i  1� are the elements originally in positions 1 through i  1, but now in sorted order. We state these properties of AŒ1 W i  1� formally as a loop invariant: 20 Chapter 2 Getting Started 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 2 4 6 1 3 (a) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 5 4 6 1 3 (b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 5 6 1 3 (c) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 5 6 1 3 (d) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 5 6 1 3 (e) 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 5 6 1 3 (f) Figure 2.2 The operation of I NSERTION-SORT.A; n/, where A initially contains the sequence h5; 2; 4; 6; 1; 3i and n D 6.

At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 138, the subarray AŒ1 W i  1� consists of the elements originally in AŒ1 W i  1�, but in sorted order. Loop invariants help us understand why an algorithm is correct. When you’re using a loop invariant, you need to show three things: Initialization: It is true prior to the ûrst iteration of the loop. Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration. Termination: The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant4usually along with the reason that the loop terminated4gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct. When the ûrst two properties hold, the loop invariant is true prior to every iteration of the loop. (Of course, you are free to use established facts other than the loop invariant itself to prove that the loop invariant remains true before each iteration.) A loop-invariant proof is a form of mathematical induction, where to prove that a property holds, you prove a base case and an inductive step. Here, showing that the invariant holds before the ûrst iteration corresponds to the base case, and showing that the invariant holds from iteration to iteration corresponds to the inductive step. The third property is perhaps the most important one, since you are using the loop invariant to show correctness. Typically, you use the loop invariant along with the condition that caused the loop to terminate. Mathematical induction typically applies the inductive step inûnitely, but in a loop invariant the <induction= stops when the loop terminates. 2.1 Insertion sort 21 Let’s see how these properties hold for insertion sort. Initialization: We start by showing that the loop invariant holds before the ûrst loop iteration, when i D 2. 2 The subarray AŒ1 W i  1� consists of just the single element AŒ1�, which is in fact the original element in AŒ1�. Moreover, this subarray is sorted (after all, how could a subarray with just one value not be sorted?), which shows that the loop invariant holds prior to the ûrst iteration of the loop. Maintenance: Next, we tackle the second property: showing that each iteration maintains the loop invariant. Informally, the body of the for loop works by moving the values in AŒi  1�, AŒi  2�, AŒi  3�, and so on by one position to the right until it ûnds the proper position for AŒi � (lines 437), at which point it inserts the value of AŒi � (line 8). The subarray AŒ1 W i � then consists of the elements originally in AŒ1 W i �, but in sorted order. Incrementing i (increasing its value by 1) for the next iteration of the for loop then preserves the loop invariant. A more formal treatment of the second property would require us to state and show a loop invariant for the while loop of lines 537. Let’s not get bogged down in such formalism just yet. Instead, we’ll rely on our informal analysis to show that the second property holds for the outer loop. Termination: Finally, we examine loop termination. The loop variable i starts at 2 and increases by 1 in each iteration. Once i ’s value exceeds n in line 1, the loop terminates. That is, the loop terminates once i equals n C 1. Substituting n C 1 for i in the wording of the loop invariant yields that the subarray AŒ1 W n� consists of the elements originally in AŒ1 W n�, but in sorted order. Hence, the algorithm is correct. This method of loop invariants is used to show correctness in various places throughout this book. Pseudocode conventions We use the following conventions in our pseudocode.  Indentation indicates block structure. For example, the body of the for loop that begins on line 1 consists of lines 238, and the body of the while loop that 2 When the loop is a for loop, the loop-invariant check just prior to the ûrst iteration occurs immedi- ately after the initial assignment to the loop-counter variable and just before the ûrst test in the loop header. In the case of I NSERTION-SORT, this time is after assigning 2 to the variable i but before the ûrst test of whether i හ n. 22 Chapter 2 Getting Started begins on line 5 contains lines 637 but not line 8. Our indentation style applies to if-else statements 3 as well. Using indentation instead of textual indicators of block structure, such as begin and end statements or curly braces, reduces clutter while preserving, or even enhancing, clarity. 4  The looping constructs while, for, and repeat-until and the if-else conditional construct have interpretations similar to those in C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. 5 In this book, the loop counter retains its value after the loop is exited, unlike some situations that arise in C++ and Java. Thus, immediately after a for loop, the loop counter’s value is the value that ûrst exceeded the for loop bound. 6 We used this property in our correctness argument for insertion sort. The for loop header in line 1 is for i D 2 to n, and so when this loop terminates, i equals nC1. We use the keyword to when a for loop increments its loop counter in each iteration, and we use the keyword downto when a for loop decrements its loop counter (reduces its value by 1 in each iteration). When the loop counter changes by an amount greater than 1, the amount of change follows the optional keyword by.  The symbol <//= indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment.  Variables (such as i , j , and key) are local to the given procedure. We won’t use global variables without explicit indication.  We access array elements by specifying the array name followed by the index in square brackets. For example, AŒi � indicates the i th element of the array A. Although many programming languages enforce 0-origin indexing for arrays (0 is the smallest valid index), we choose whichever indexing scheme is clearest for human readers to understand. Because people usually start counting at 1, not 0, most4but not all4of the arrays in this book use 1-origin indexing. To be 3 In an if-else statement, we indent else at the same level as its matching if. The ûrst executable line of an else clause appears on the same line as the keyword else. For multiway tests, we use elseif for tests after the ûrst one. When it is the ûrst line in an else clause, an if statement appears on the line following else so that you do not misconstrue it as elseif. 4 Each pseudocode procedure in this book appears on one page so that you do not need to discern levels of indentation in pseudocode that is split across pages. 5 Most block-structured languages have equivalent constructs, though the exact syntax may differ. Python lacks repeat-until loops, and its for loops operate differently from the for loops in this book. Think of the pseudocode line <for i D 1 to n= as equivalent to <for i in range(1, n+1)= in Python. 6 In Python, the loop counter retains its value after the loop is exited, but the value it retains is the value it had during the ûnal iteration of the for loop, rather than the value that exceeded the loop bound. That is because a Python for loop iterates through a list, which may contain nonnumeric values. 2.1 Insertion sort 23 clear about whether a particular algorithm assumes 0-origin or 1-origin index- ing, we’ll specify the bounds of the arrays explicitly. If you are implementing an algorithm that we specify using 1-origin indexing, but you’re writing in a programming language that enforces 0-origin indexing (such as C, C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript), then give yourself credit for being able to adjust. You can either always subtract 1 from each index or allocate each array with one extra position and just ignore position 0. The notation <W= denotes a subarray. Thus, AŒi W j � indicates the subarray of A consisting of the elements AŒi �; AŒi C 1�; : : : ; AŒj �. 7 We also use this notation to indicate the bounds of an array, as we did earlier when discussing the array AŒ1 W n�.  We typically organize compound data into objects, which are composed of attributes. We access a particular attribute using the syntax found in many object-oriented programming languages: the object name, followed by a dot, followed by the attribute name. For example, if an object x has attribute f , we denote this attribute by x: f . We treat a variable representing an array or object as a pointer (known as a reference in some programming languages) to the data representing the array or object. For all attributes f of an object x , setting y D x causes y: f to equal x: f . Moreover, if we now set x: f D 3, then afterward not only does x: f equal 3, but y: f equals 3 as well. In other words, x and y point to the same object after the assignment y D x . This way of treating arrays and objects is consistent with most contemporary programming languages. Our attribute notation can <cascade.= For example, suppose that the attribute f is itself a pointer to some type of object that has an attribute g. Then the notation x: f : g is implicitly parenthesized as .x: f /: g. In other words, if we had assigned y D x: f , then x: f : g is the same as y: g. Sometimes a pointer refers to no object at all. In this case, we give it the special value NIL.  We pass parameters to a procedure by value: the called procedure receives its own copy of the parameters, and if it assigns a value to a parameter, the change is not seen by the calling procedure. When objects are passed, the pointer to the data representing the object is copied, but the object’s attributes are not. For example, if x is a parameter of a called procedure, the assignment x D y within 7 If you’re used to programming in Python, bear in mind that in this book, the subarray AŒi W j � includes the element AŒj �. In Python, the last element of AŒi W j � is AŒj  1�. Python allows negative indices, which count from the back end of the list. This book does not use negative array indices. 24 Chapter 2 Getting Started the called procedure is not visible to the calling procedure. The assignment x: f D 3, however, is visible if the calling procedure has a pointer to the same object as x . Similarly, arrays are passed by pointer, so that a pointer to the array is passed, rather than the entire array, and changes to individual array elements are visible to the calling procedure. Again, most contemporary programming languages work this way.  A return statement immediately transfers control back to the point of call in the calling procedure. Most return statements also take a value to pass back to the caller. Our pseudocode differs from many programming languages in that we allow multiple values to be returned in a single return statement without having to create objects to package them together. 8  The boolean operators <and= and <or= are short circuiting. That is, evaluate the expression <x and y = by ûrst evaluating x . If x evaluates to FALSE, then the entire expression cannot evaluate to TRUE, and therefore y is not evaluated. If, on the other hand, x evaluates to TRUE, y must be evaluated to determine the value of the entire expression. Similarly, in the expression <x or y = the ex- pression y is evaluated only if x evaluates to FALSE. Short-circuiting operators allow us to write boolean expressions such as <x ¤ NIL and x: f D y = without worrying about what happens upon evaluating x: f when x is NIL.  The keyword error indicates that an error occurred because conditions were wrong for the procedure to have been called, and the procedure immediately terminates. The calling procedure is responsible for handling the error, and so we do not specify what action to take. Exercises 2.1-1 Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of I NSERTION-SORT on an array initially containing the sequence h31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58i. 2.1-2 Consider the procedure SUM-ARRAY on the facing page. It computes the sum of the n numbers in array AŒ1 W n�. State a loop invariant for this procedure, and use its initialization, maintenance, and termination properties to show that the SUM- ARRAY procedure returns the sum of the numbers in AŒ1 W n�. 8 Python’s tuple notation allows return statements to return multiple values without creating objects from a programmer-deûned class. 2.2 Analyzing algorithms 25 SUM-ARRAY.A; n/ 1 sum D 0 2 for i D 1 to n 3 sum D sum C AŒi � 4 return sum 2.1-3 Rewrite the I NSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into monotonically decreasing in- stead of monotonically increasing order. 2.1-4 Consider the searching problem: Input: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i stored in array AŒ1 W n� and a value x . Output: An index i such that x equals AŒi � or the special value NIL if x does not appear in A. Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the array from begin- ning to end, looking for x . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulûlls the three necessary properties. 2.1-5 Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers a and b, stored in two n-element arrays AŒ0 W n  1� and BŒ0 W n  1�, where each element is either 0 or 1, a D P n1 i D0 AŒi �  2 i , and b D P n1 i D0 BŒi �  2 i . The sum c D a C b of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an .n C 1/-element array C Œ0 W n�, where c D P n i D0 C Œi �  2 i . Write a procedure ADD-BINARY-I NTEGERS that takes as input arrays A and B , along with the length n, and returns array C holding the sum. 2.2 Analyzing algorithms Analyzing an algorithm has come to mean predicting the resources that the algo- rithm requires. You might consider resources such as memory, communication bandwidth, or energy consumption. Most often, however, you’ll want to measure computational time. If you analyze several candidate algorithms for a problem, 26 Chapter 2 Getting Started you can identify the most efûcient one. There might be more than just one viable candidate, but you can often rule out several inferior algorithms in the process. Before you can analyze an algorithm, you need a model of the technology that it runs on, including the resources of that technology and a way to express their costs. Most of this book assumes a generic one-processor, random-access ma- chine (RAM) model of computation as the implementation technology, with the understanding that algorithms are implemented as computer programs. In the RAM model, instructions execute one after another, with no concurrent operations. The RAM model assumes that each instruction takes the same amount of time as any other instruction and that each data access4using the value of a variable or storing into a variable4takes the same amount of time as any other data access. In other words, in the RAM model each instruction or data access takes a constant amount of time4even indexing into an array. 9 Strictly speaking, we should precisely deûne the instructions of the RAM model and their costs. To do so, however, would be tedious and yield little insight into al- gorithm design and analysis. Yet we must be careful not to abuse the RAM model. For example, what if a RAM had an instruction that sorts? Then you could sort in just one step. Such a RAM would be unrealistic, since such instructions do not appear in real computers. Our guide, therefore, is how real computers are de- signed. The RAM model contains instructions commonly found in real computers: arithmetic (such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, üoor, ceiling), data movement (load, store, copy), and control (conditional and unconditional branch, subroutine call and return). The data types in the RAM model are integer, üoating point (for storing real- number approximations), and character. Real computers do not usually have a separate data type for the boolean values TRUE and FALSE. Instead, they often test whether an integer value is 0 (FALSE) or nonzero (TRUE), as in C. Although we typically do not concern ourselves with precision for üoating-point values in this book (many numbers cannot be represented exactly in üoating point), precision is crucial for most applications. We also assume that each word of data has a limit on the number of bits. For example, when working with inputs of size n, we typically 9 We assume that each element of a given array occupies the same number of bytes and that the elements of a given array are stored in contiguous memory locations. For example, if array AŒ1 W n� starts at memory address 1000 and each element occupies four bytes, then element AŒi� is at address 1000 C 4.i  1/. In general, computing the address in memory of a particular array element requires at most one subtraction (no subtraction for a 0-origin array), one multiplication (often implemented as a shift operation if the element size is an exact power of 2), and one addition. Furthermore, for code that iterates through the elements of an array in order, an optimizing compiler can generate the address of each element using just one addition, by adding the element size to the address of the preceding element. 2.2 Analyzing algorithms 27 assume that integers are represented by c log 2 n bits for some constant c  1. We require c  1 so that each word can hold the value of n, enabling us to index the individual input elements, and we restrict c to be a constant so that the word size does not grow arbitrarily. (If the word size could grow arbitrarily, we could store huge amounts of data in one word and operate on it all in constant time4an unrealistic scenario.) Real computers contain instructions not listed above, and such instructions rep- resent a gray area in the RAM model. For example, is exponentiation a constant- time instruction? In the general case, no: to compute x n when x and n are general integers typically takes time logarithmic in n (see equation (31.34) on page 934), and you must worry about whether the result ûts into a computer word. If n is an exact power of 2, however, exponentiation can usually be viewed as a constant-time operation. Many computers have a <shift left= instruction, which in constant time shifts the bits of an integer by n positions to the left. In most computers, shifting the bits of an integer by 1 position to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2, so that shifting the bits by n positions to the left is equivalent to multiplying by 2 n . Therefore, such computers can compute 2 n in 1 constant-time instruction by shift- ing the integer 1 by n positions to the left, as long as n is no more than the number of bits in a computer word. We’ll try to avoid such gray areas in the RAM model and treat computing 2 n and multiplying by 2 n as constant-time operations when the result is small enough to ût in a computer word. The RAM model does not account for the memory hierarchy that is common in contemporary computers. It models neither caches nor virtual memory. Sev- eral other computational models attempt to account for memory-hierarchy effects, which are sometimes signiûcant in real programs on real machines. Section 11.5 and a handful of problems in this book examine memory-hierarchy effects, but for the most part, the analyses in this book do not consider them. Models that include the memory hierarchy are quite a bit more complex than the RAM model, and so they can be difûcult to work with. Moreover, RAM-model analyses are usually excellent predictors of performance on actual machines. Although it is often straightforward to analyze an algorithm in the RAM model, sometimes it can be quite a challenge. You might need to employ mathematical tools such as combinatorics, probability theory, algebraic dexterity, and the ability to identify the most signiûcant terms in a formula. Because an algorithm might behave differently for each possible input, we need a means for summarizing that behavior in simple, easily understood formulas. Analysis of insertion sort How long does the I NSERTION-SORT procedure take? One way to tell would be for you to run it on your computer and time how long it takes to run. Of course, you’d 28 Chapter 2 Getting Started ûrst have to implement it in a real programming language, since you cannot run our pseudocode directly. What would such a timing test tell you? You would ûnd out how long insertion sort takes to run on your particular computer, on that particular input, under the particular implementation that you created, with the particular compiler or interpreter that you ran, with the particular libraries that you linked in, and with the particular background tasks that were running on your computer concurrently with your timing test (such as checking for incoming information over a network). If you run insertion sort again on your computer with the same input, you might even get a different timing result. From running just one implementation of insertion sort on just one computer and on just one input, what would you be able to determine about insertion sort’s running time if you were to give it a different input, if you were to run it on a different computer, or if you were to implement it in a different programming language? Not much. We need a way to predict, given a new input, how long insertion sort will take. Instead of timing a run, or even several runs, of insertion sort, we can determine how long it takes by analyzing the algorithm itself. We’ll examine how many times it executes each line of pseudocode and how long each line of pseudocode takes to run. We’ll ûrst come up with a precise but complicated formula for the running time. Then, we’ll distill the important part of the formula using a convenient no- tation that can help us compare the running times of different algorithms for the same problem. How do we analyze insertion sort? First, let’s acknowledge that the running time depends on the input. You shouldn’t be terribly surprised that sorting a thousand numbers takes longer than sorting three numbers. Moreover, insertion sort can take different amounts of time to sort two input arrays of the same size, depending on how nearly sorted they already are. Even though the running time can depend on many features of the input, we’ll focus on the one that has been shown to have the greatest effect, namely the size of the input, and describe the running time of a program as a function of the size of its input. To do so, we need to deûne the terms <running time= and <input size= more carefully. We also need to be clear about whether we are discussing the running time for an input that elicits the worst-case behavior, the best-case behavior, or some other case. The best notion for input size depends on the problem being studied. For many problems, such as sorting or computing discrete Fourier transforms, the most nat- ural measure is the number of items in the input4for example, the number n of items being sorted. For many other problems, such as multiplying two integers, the best measure of input size is the total number of bits needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation. Sometimes it is more appropriate to describe the size of the input with more than just one number. For example, if the input to an algorithm is a graph, we usually characterize the input size by both the number 2.2 Analyzing algorithms 29 of vertices and the number of edges in the graph. We’ll indicate which input size measure is being used with each problem we study. The running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of in- structions and data accesses executed. How we account for these costs should be independent of any particular computer, but within the framework of the RAM model. For the moment, let us adopt the following view. A constant amount of time is required to execute each line of our pseudocode. One line might take more or less time than another line, but we’ll assume that each execution of the kth line takes c k time, where c k is a constant. This viewpoint is in keeping with the RAM model, and it also reüects how the pseudocode would be implemented on most actual computers. 10 Let’s analyze the I NSERTION-SORT procedure. As promised, we’ll start by de- vising a precise formula that uses the input size and all the statement costs c k . This formula turns out to be messy, however. We’ll then switch to a simpler no- tation that is more concise and easier to use. This simpler notation makes clear how to compare the running times of algorithms, especially as the size of the input increases. To analyze the I NSERTION-SORT procedure, let’s view it on the following page with the time cost of each statement and the number of times each statement is executed. For each i D 2; 3; : : : ; n, let t i denote the number of times the while loop test in line 5 is executed for that value of i . When a for or while loop exits in the usual way4because the test in the loop header comes up FALSE4the test is executed one time more than the loop body. Because comments are not executable statements, assume that they take no time. The running time of the algorithm is the sum of running times for each state- ment executed. A statement that takes c k steps to execute and executes m times contributes c k m to the total running time. 11 We usually denote the running time of an algorithm on an input of size n by T .n/. To compute T .n/, the running time of I NSERTION-SORT on an input of n values, we sum the products of the cost and times columns, obtaining 10 There are some subtleties here. Computational steps that we specify in English are often variants of a procedure that requires more than just a constant amount of time. For example, in the R ADIX- SORT procedure on page 213, one line reads <use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i ,= which, as we shall see, takes more than a constant amount of time. Also, although a statement that calls a subroutine takes only constant time, the subroutine itself, once invoked, may take more. That is, we separate the process of calling the subroutine4passing parameters to it, etc.4from the process of executing the subroutine. 11 This characteristic does not necessarily hold for a resource such as memory. A statement that references m words of memory and is executed n times does not necessarily reference mn distinct words of memory. 30 Chapter 2 Getting Started I NSERTION-SORT .A; n/ cost times 1 for i D 2 to n c 1 n 2 key D AŒi � c 2 n  1 3 // Insert AŒi � into the sorted subarray AŒ1 W i  1�. 0 n  1 4 j D i  1 c 4 n  1 5 while j > 0 and AŒj � > key c 5 P n i D2 t i 6 AŒj C 1� D AŒj � c 6 P n i D2 .t i  1/ 7 j D j  1 c 7 P n i D2 .t i  1/ 8 AŒj C 1� D key c 8 n  1 T .n/ D c 1 n C c 2 .n  1/ C c 4 .n  1/ C c 5 n X i D2 t i C c 6 n X i D2 .t i  1/ C c 7 n X i D2 .t i  1/ C c 8 .n  1/ : Even for inputs of a given size, an algorithm’s running time may depend on which input of that size is given. For example, in I NSERTION-SORT, the best case occurs when the array is already sorted. In this case, each time that line 5 executes, the value of key4the value originally in AŒi �4is already greater than or equal to all values in AŒ1 W i  1�, so that the while loop of lines 537 always exits upon the ûrst test in line 5. Therefore, we have that t i D 1 for i D 2; 3; : : : ; n, and the best-case running time is given by T .n/ D c 1 n C c 2 .n  1/ C c 4 .n  1/ C c 5 .n  1/ C c 8 .n  1/ D .c 1 C c 2 C c 4 C c 5 C c 8 /n  .c 2 C c 4 C c 5 C c 8 / : (2.1) We can express this running time as an C b for constants a and b that depend on the statement costs c k (where a D c 1 Cc 2 Cc 4 Cc 5 Cc 8 and b D c 2 Cc 4 Cc 5 Cc 8 ). The running time is thus a linear function of n. The worst case arises when the array is in reverse sorted order4that is, it starts out in decreasing order. The procedure must compare each element AŒi � with each element in the entire sorted subarray AŒ1 W i  1�, and so t i D i for i D 2; 3; : : : ; n.

The running time is thus a quadratic function of n. Typically, as in insertion sort, the running time of an algorithm is ûxed for a given input, although we’ll also see some interesting <randomized= algorithms whose behavior can vary even for a ûxed input. Worst-case and average-case analysis Our analysis of insertion sort looked at both the best case, in which the input array was already sorted, and the worst case, in which the input array was reverse sorted. For the remainder of this book, though, we’ll usually (but not always) concentrate on ûnding only the worst-case running time, that is, the longest running time for any input of size n. Why? Here are three reasons:  The worst-case running time of an algorithm gives an upper bound on the run- ning time for any input. If you know it, then you have a guarantee that the algorithm never takes any longer. You need not make some educated guess about the running time and hope that it never gets much worse. This feature is especially important for real-time computing, in which operations must com- plete by a deadline.  For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often. For example, in search- ing a database for a particular piece of information, the searching algorithm’s worst case often occurs when the information is not present in the database. In some applications, searches for absent information may be frequent. 32 Chapter 2 Getting Started  The <average case= is often roughly as bad as the worst case. Suppose that you run insertion sort on an array of n randomly chosen numbers. How long does it take to determine where in subarray AŒ1 W i  1� to insert element AŒi �? On average, half the elements in AŒ1 W i  1� are less than AŒi �, and half the elements are greater. On average, therefore, AŒi � is compared with just half of the subarray AŒ1 W i  1�, and so t i is about i=2. The resulting average-case running time turns out to be a quadratic function of the input size, just like the worst-case running time. In some particular cases, we’ll be interested in the average-case running time of an algorithm. We’ll see the technique of probabilistic analysis applied to various algorithms throughout this book. The scope of average-case analysis is limited, because it may not be apparent what constitutes an <average= input for a particular problem. Often, we’ll assume that all inputs of a given size are equally likely. In practice, this assumption may be violated, but we can sometimes use a randomized algorithm, which makes random choices, to allow a probabilistic analysis and yield an expected running time. We explore randomized algorithms more in Chapter 5 and in several other subsequent chapters. Order of growth In order to ease our analysis of the I NSERTION-SORT procedure, we used some simplifying abstractions. First, we ignored the actual cost of each statement, using the constants c k to represent these costs. Still, the best-case and worst-case run- ning times in equations (2.1) and (2.2) are rather unwieldy. The constants in these expressions give us more detail than we really need. That’s why we also expressed the best-case running time as an C b for constants a and b that depend on the state- ment costs c k and why we expressed the worst-case running time as an 2 C bn C c for constants a, b, and c that depend on the statement costs. We thus ignored not only the actual statement costs, but also the abstract costs c k . Let’s now make one more simplifying abstraction: it is the rate of growth, or order of growth, of the running time that really interests us. We therefore consider only the leading term of a formula (e.g., an 2 ), since the lower-order terms are rela- tively insigniûcant for large values of n. We also ignore the leading term’s constant coefûcient, since constant factors are less signiûcant than the rate of growth in de- termining computational efûciency for large inputs. For insertion sort’s worst-case running time, when we ignore the lower-order terms and the leading term’s con- stant coefûcient, only the factor of n 2 from the leading term remains. That factor, n 2 , is by far the most important part of the running time. For example, suppose that an algorithm implemented on a particular machine takes n 2 =100 C 100n C 17 mi- croseconds on an input of size n. Although the coefûcients of 1=100 for the n 2 term and 100 for the n term differ by four orders of magnitude, the n 2 =100 term domi- 2.2 Analyzing algorithms 33 nates the 100n term once n exceeds 10,000. Although 10,000 might seem large, it is smaller than the population of an average town. Many real-world problems have much larger input sizes. To highlight the order of growth of the running time, we have a special notation that uses the Greek letter ‚ (theta). We write that insertion sort has a worst-case running time of ‚.n 2 / (pronounced <theta of n-squared= or just <theta n-squared=). We also write that insertion sort has a best-case running time of ‚.n/ (<theta of n= or <theta n=). For now, think of ‚-notation as saying <roughly proportional when n is large,= so that ‚.n 2 / means <roughly proportional to n 2 when n is large= and ‚.n/ means <roughly proportional to n when n is large= We’ll use ‚-notation informally in this chapter and deûne it precisely in Chapter 3. We usually consider one algorithm to be more efûcient than another if its worst- case running time has a lower order of growth. Due to constant factors and lower- order terms, an algorithm whose running time has a higher order of growth might take less time for small inputs than an algorithm whose running time has a lower or- der of growth. But on large enough inputs, an algorithm whose worst-case running time is ‚.n 2 /, for example, takes less time in the worst case than an algorithm whose worst-case running time is ‚.n 3 /. Regardless of the constants hidden by the ‚-notation, there is always some number, say n 0 , such that for all input sizes n  n 0 , the ‚.n 2 / algorithm beats the ‚.n 3 / algorithm in the worst case. Exercises 2.2-1 Express the function n 3 =1000 C 100n 2  100n C 3 in terms of ‚-notation. 2.2-2 Consider sorting n numbers stored in array AŒ1 W n� by ûrst ûnding the smallest element of AŒ1 W n� and exchanging it with the element in AŒ1�. Then ûnd the smallest element of AŒ2 W n�, and exchange it with AŒ2�. Then ûnd the smallest element of AŒ3 W n�, and exchange it with AŒ3�. Continue in this manner for the ûrst n  1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as selection sort. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the ûrst n  1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the worst-case running time of selection sort in ‚-notation. Is the best-case running time any better? 2.2-3 Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-4). How many elements of the input array need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? 34 Chapter 2 Getting Started Using ‚-notation, give the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search. Justify your answers. 2.2-4 How can you modify any sorting algorithm to have a good best-case running time? 2.3 Designing algorithms You can choose from a wide range of algorithm design techniques. Insertion sort uses the incremental method: for each element AŒi �, insert it into its proper place in the subarray AŒ1 W i �, having already sorted the subarray AŒ1 W i  1�. This section examines another design method, known as <divide-and-conquer,= which we explore in more detail in Chapter 4. We’ll use divide-and-conquer to design a sorting algorithm whose worst-case running time is much less than that of insertion sort. One advantage of using an algorithm that follows the divide-and- conquer method is that analyzing its running time is often straightforward, using techniques that we’ll explore in Chapter 4. 2.3.1 The divide-and-conquer method Many useful algorithms are recursive in structure: to solve a given problem, they recurse (call themselves) one or more times to handle closely related subprob- lems. These algorithms typically follow the divide-and-conquer method: they break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original prob- lem but smaller in size, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem. In the divide-and-conquer method, if the problem is small enough4the base case4you just solve it directly without recursing. Otherwise4the recursive case 4you perform three characteristic steps: Divide the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. Combine the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem. The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer method. In each step, it sorts a subarray AŒp W r�, starting with the entire array AŒ1 W n� and recursing down to smaller and smaller subarrays. Here is how merge sort operates: 2.3 Designing algorithms 35 Divide the subarray AŒp W r� to be sorted into two adjacent subarrays, each of half the size. To do so, compute the midpoint q of AŒp W r� (taking the average of p and r ), and divide AŒp W r� into subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r�. Conquer by sorting each of the two subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� recursively using merge sort. Combine by merging the two sorted subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� back into AŒp W r�, producing the sorted answer. The recursion <bottoms out=4it reaches the base case4when the subarray AŒp W r� to be sorted has just 1 element, that is, when p equals r . As we noted in the ini- tialization argument for I NSERTION-SORT’s loop invariant, a subarray comprising just a single element is always sorted. The key operation of the merge sort algorithm occurs in the <combine= step, which merges two adjacent, sorted subarrays. The merge operation is performed by the auxiliary procedure MERGE.A; p; q; r/ on the following page, where A is an array and p, q, and r are indices into the array such that p හ q < r . The procedure assumes that the adjacent subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� were al- ready recursively sorted. It merges the two sorted subarrays to form a single sorted subarray that replaces the current subarray AŒp W r�. To understand how the MERGE procedure works, let’s return to our card-playing motif. Suppose that you have two piles of cards face up on a table. Each pile is sorted, with the smallest-value cards on top. You wish to merge the two piles into a single sorted output pile, which is to be face down on the table. The basic step consists of choosing the smaller of the two cards on top of the face-up piles, removing it from its pile4which exposes a new top card4and placing this card face down onto the output pile. Repeat this step until one input pile is empty, at which time you can just take the remaining input pile and üip over the entire pile, placing it face down onto the output pile. Let’s think about how long it takes to merge two sorted piles of cards. Each basic step takes constant time, since you are comparing just the two top cards. If the two sorted piles that you start with each have n=2 cards, then the number of basic steps is at least n=2 (since in whichever pile was emptied, every card was found to be smaller than some card from the other pile) and at most n (actually, at most n  1, since after n  1 basic steps, one of the piles must be empty). With each basic step taking constant time and the total number of basic steps being between n=2 and n, we can say that merging takes time roughly proportional to n. That is, merging takes ‚.n/ time. In detail, the MERGE procedure works as follows. It copies the two subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� into temporary arrays L and R (<left= and <right=), and then it merges the values in L and R back into AŒp W r�. Lines 1 and 2 compute the lengths n L and n R of the subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r�, respectively. Then 36 Chapter 2 Getting Started MERGE.A; p; q; r/ 1 n L D q  p C 1 // length of AŒp W q� 2 n R D r  q // length of AŒq C 1 W r� 3 let LŒ0 W n L  1� and RŒ0 W n R  1� be new arrays 4 for i D 0 to n L  1 // copy AŒp W q� into LŒ0 W n L  1� 5 LŒi� D AŒp C i� 6 for j D 0 to n R  1 // copy AŒq C 1 W r� into RŒ0 W n R  1� 7 RŒj � D AŒq C j C 1� 8 i D 0 // i indexes the smallest remaining element in L 9 j D 0 // j indexes the smallest remaining element in R 10 k D p // k indexes the location in A to ûll 11 // As long as each of the arrays L and R contains an unmerged element, // copy the smallest unmerged element back into AŒp W r�. 12 while i < n L and j < n R 13 if LŒi� හ RŒj � 14 AŒk� D LŒi� 15 i D i C 1 16 else AŒk� D RŒj � 17 j D j C 1 18 k D k C 1 19 // Having gone through one of L and R entirely, copy the // remainder of the other to the end of AŒp W r�. 20 while i < n L 21 AŒk� D LŒi� 22 i D i C 1 23 k D k C 1 24 while j < n R 25 AŒk� D RŒj � 26 j D j C 1 27 k D k C 1 line 3 creates arrays LŒ0 W n L  1� and RŒ0 W n R  1� with respective lengths n L and n R . 12 The for loop of lines 435 copies the subarray AŒp W q� into L, and the for loop of lines 637 copies the subarray AŒq C 1 W r� into R. Lines 8318, illustrated in Figure 2.3, perform the basic steps. The while loop of lines 12318 repeatedly identiûes the smallest value in L and R that has yet to 12 This procedure is the rare case that uses both 1-origin indexing (for array A) and 0-origin indexing (for arrays L and R). Using 0-origin indexing for L and R makes for a simpler loop invariant in Exercise 2.3-3. 2.3 Designing algorithms 37 A L R 1 2 3 i j k (a) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 A L R i j k (b) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 A L R 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 i j k (c) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 6 7 1 2 3 5 2 A L R i j k (d) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 7 1 2 3 5 2 2 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 A L R 1 2 3 i j k (e) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 1 2 3 5 2 2 3 A L R i j k (f) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 2 3 5 2 2 3 4 A L R i j k (g) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 3 5 2 2 3 4 5 A L R 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 i j k (h) 2 4 6 7 1 2 3 5 1 7 2 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 8 … 17 … 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 Figure 2.3 The operation of the while loop in lines 8318 in the call M ERGE.A; 9; 12; 16/, when the subarray AŒ9 W 16� contains the values h2; 4; 6; 7; 1; 2; 3; 5i. After allocating and copying into the arrays L and R, the array L contains h2; 4; 6; 7i, and the array R contains h1; 2; 3; 5i. Tan positions in A contain their ûnal values, and tan positions in L and R contain values that have yet to be copied back into A. Taken together, the tan positions always comprise the values originally in AŒ9 W 16�. Blue positions in A contain values that will be copied over, and dark positions in L and R contain values that have already been copied back into A. (a)–(g) The arrays A, L, and R, and their respective indices k, i , and j prior to each iteration of the loop of lines 12318.

(h) The arrays and indices at termination. The while loops of lines 20323 and 24327 copied back into A the remaining values in L and R, which are the largest values originally in AŒ9 W 16�. Here, lines 20323 copied LŒ2 W 3� into AŒ15 W 16�, and because all values in R had already been copied back into A, the while loop of lines 24327 iterated 0 times. At this point, the subarray in AŒ9 W 16� is sorted. 38 Chapter 2 Getting Started be copied back into AŒp W r� and copies it back in. As the comments indicate, the index k gives the position of A that is being ûlled in, and the indices i and j give the positions in L and R, respectively, of the smallest remaining values. Eventually, either all of L or all of R is copied back into AŒp W r�, and this loop terminates. If the loop terminates because all of R has been copied back, that is, because j equals n R , then i is still less than n L , so that some of L has yet to be copied back, and these values are the greatest in both L and R. In this case, the while loop of lines 20323 copies these remaining values of L into the last few positions of AŒp W r�. Because j equals n R , the while loop of lines 24327 iterates 0 times. If instead the while loop of lines 12318 terminates because i equals n L , then all of L has already been copied back into AŒp W r�, and the while loop of lines 24327 copies the remaining values of R back into the end of AŒp W r�. To see that the MERGE procedure runs in ‚.n/ time, where n D r  p C 1, 13 observe that each of lines 133 and 8310 takes constant time, and the for loops of lines 437 take ‚.n L C n R / D ‚.n/ time. 14 To account for the three while loops of lines 12318, 20323, and 24327, observe that each iteration of these loops copies exactly one value from L or R back into A and that every value is copied back into A exactly once. Therefore, these three loops together make a total of n iterations. Since each iteration of each of the three loops takes constant time, the total time spent in these three loops is ‚.n/. We can now use the MERGE procedure as a subroutine in the merge sort al- gorithm. The procedure MERGE-SORT.A; p; r/ on the facing page sorts the ele- ments in the subarray AŒp W r�. If p equals r , the subarray has just 1 element and is therefore already sorted. Otherwise, we must have p < r , and MERGE-SORT runs the divide, conquer, and combine steps. The divide step simply computes an index q that partitions AŒp W r� into two adjacent subarrays: AŒp W q�, containing dn=2e elements, and AŒq C 1 W r�, containing bn=2c elements. 15 The initial call MERGE-SORT .A; 1; n/ sorts the entire array AŒ1 W n�. Figure 2.4 illustrates the operation of the procedure for n D 8, showing also the sequence of divide and merge steps. The algorithm recursively divides the array down to 1-element subarrays. The combine steps merge pairs of 1-element subar- 13 If you’re wondering where the <C1= comes from, imagine that r D p C 1. Then the subar- ray AŒp W r� consists of two elements, and r  p C 1 D 2. 14 Chapter 3 shows how to formally interpret equations containing ‚-notation. 15 The expression dxe denotes the least integer greater than or equal to x, and bxc denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. These notations are deûned in Section 3.3. The easiest way to verify that setting q to b.p C r/=2c yields subarrays AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� of sizes dn=2e and bn=2c, respectively, is to examine the four cases that arise depending on whether each of p and r is odd or even. 2.3 Designing algorithms 39 MERGE-SORT.A; p; r/ 1 if p  r // zero or one element? 2 return 3 q D b.p C r/=2c // midpoint of AŒp W r� 4 MERGE-SORT .A; p; q/ // recursively sort AŒp W q� 5 MERGE-SORT .A; q C 1; r/ // recursively sort AŒq C 1 W r� 6 // Merge AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� into AŒp W r�. 7 MERGE.A; p; q; r/ rays to form sorted subarrays of length 2, merges those to form sorted subarrays of length 4, and merges those to form the ûnal sorted subarray of length 8. If n is not an exact power of 2, then some divide steps create subarrays whose lengths differ by 1. (For example, when dividing a subarray of length 7, one subarray has length 4 and the other has length 3.) Regardless of the lengths of the two subarrays being merged, the time to merge a total of n items is ‚.n/. 2.3.2 Analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms When an algorithm contains a recursive call, you can often describe its running time by a recurrence equation or recurrence, which describes the overall running time on a problem of size n in terms of the running time of the same algorithm on smaller inputs. You can then use mathematical tools to solve the recurrence and provide bounds on the performance of the algorithm. A recurrence for the running time of a divide-and-conquer algorithm falls out from the three steps of the basic method. As we did for insertion sort, let T .n/ be the worst-case running time on a problem of size n. If the problem size is small enough, say n < n 0 for some constant n 0 > 0, the straightforward solution takes constant time, which we write as ‚.1/. 16 Suppose that the division of the problem yields a subproblems, each with size n=b, that is, 1=b the size of the original. For merge sort, both a and b are 2, but we’ll see other divide-and-conquer algorithms in which a ¤ b. It takes T .n=b/ time to solve one subproblem of size n=b, and so it takes aT .n=b/ time to solve all a of them. If it takes D.n/ time to divide the problem into subproblems and C.n/ time to combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution to the original problem, we get the recurrence 16 If you’re wondering where ‚.1/ comes from, think of it this way. When we say that n 2 =100 is ‚.n 2 /, we are ignoring the coefûcient 1=100 of the factor n 2 . Likewise, when we say that a constant c is ‚.1/, we are ignoring the coefûcient c of the factor 1 (which you can also think of as n 0 ). 40 Chapter 2 Getting Started 12 3 7 9 14 6 11 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 3 7 9 14 6 11 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 p q r p q r p q r 12 3 7 9 1 2 3 4 p,q r 3 1 2 p,r 12 3 1 2 p,q r divide divide divide merge 1 2 3 5 6 4 11 p,q r 14 6 11 2 5 6 7 8 p,q r 12 16 p,q r p,r 12 9 3 4 p,r 7 8 p,r 7 6 5 6 p,r 13 14 p,r 14 2 7 8 p,r 17 18 p,r 11 9 7 3 4 p,q r 9 14 6 5 6 p,q r 15 11 2 7 8 p,q r 19 merge 3 7 9 12 2 6 11 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 p q r p q r 10 2 3 6 7 9 11 12 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 p q r merge 21 20 Figure 2.4 The operation of merge sort on the array A with length 8 that initially contains the sequence h12; 3; 7; 9; 14; 6; 11; 2i. The indices p, q, and r into each subarray appear above their values. Numbers in italics indicate the order in which the M ERGE-SORT and MERGE procedures are called following the initial call of M ERGE-SORT.A; 1; 8/. T .n/ D ( ‚.1/ if n < n 0 ; D.n/ C aT .n=b/ C C.n/ otherwise : Chapter 4 shows how to solve common recurrences of this form. Sometimes, the n=b size of the divide step isn’t an integer. For example, the MERGE-SORT procedure divides a problem of size n into subproblems of sizes dn=2e and bn=2c. Since the difference between dn=2e and bn=2c is at most 1, 2.3 Designing algorithms 41 which for large n is much smaller than the effect of dividing n by 2, we’ll squint a little and just call them both size n=2. As Chapter 4 will discuss, this simpliûcation of ignoring üoors and ceilings does not generally affect the order of growth of a solution to a divide-and-conquer recurrence. Another convention we’ll adopt is to omit a statement of the base cases of the recurrence, which we’ll also discuss in more detail in Chapter 4. The reason is that the base cases are pretty much always T .n/ D ‚.1/ if n < n 0 for some constant n 0 > 0. That’s because the running time of an algorithm on an input of constant size is constant. We save ourselves a lot of extra writing by adopting this convention. Analysis of merge sort Here’s how to set up the recurrence for T .n/, the worst-case running time of merge sort on n numbers. Divide: The divide step just computes the middle of the subarray, which takes constant time. Thus, D.n/ D ‚.1/. Conquer: Recursively solving two subproblems, each of size n=2, contributes 2T .n=2/ to the running time (ignoring the üoors and ceilings, as we discussed). Combine: Since the MERGE procedure on an n-element subarray takes ‚.n/ time, we have C.n/ D ‚.n/. When we add the functions D.n/ and C.n/ for the merge sort analysis, we are adding a function that is ‚.n/ and a function that is ‚.1/. This sum is a linear function of n. That is, it is roughly proportional to n when n is large, and so merge sort’s dividing and combining times together are ‚.n/. Adding ‚.n/ to the 2T .n=2/ term from the conquer step gives the recurrence for the worst-case running time T .n/ of merge sort: T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ : (2.3) Chapter 4 presents the <master theorem,= which shows that T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. 17 Compared with insertion sort, whose worst-case running time is ‚.n 2 /, merge sort trades away a factor of n for a factor of lg n. Because the logarithm function grows more slowly than any linear function, that’s a good trade. For large enough inputs, merge sort, with its ‚.n lg n/ worst-case running time, outperforms insertion sort, whose worst-case running time is ‚.n 2 /. 17 The notation lg n stands for log 2 n, although the base of the logarithm doesn’t matter here, but as computer scientists, we like logarithms base 2. Section 3.3 discusses other standard notation. 42 Chapter 2 Getting Started We do not need the master theorem, however, to understand intuitively why the solution to recurrence (2.3) is T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. For simplicity, assume that n is an exact power of 2 and that the implicit base case is n D 1. Then recurrence (2.3) is essentially T .n/ D ( c 1 if n D 1 ; 2T .n=2/ C c 2 n if n > 1 ; (2.4) where the constant c 1 > 0 represents the time required to solve a problem of size 1, and c 2 > 0 is the time per array element of the divide and combine steps. 18 Figure 2.5 illustrates one way of ûguring out the solution to recurrence (2.4). Part (a) of the ûgure shows T .n/, which part (b) expands into an equivalent tree representing the recurrence. The c 2 n term denotes the cost of dividing and com- bining at the top level of recursion, and the two subtrees of the root are the two smaller recurrences T .n=2/. Part (c) shows this process carried one step further by expanding T .n=2/. The cost for dividing and combining at each of the two nodes at the second level of recursion is c 2 n=2. Continue to expand each node in the tree by breaking it into its constituent parts as determined by the recurrence, until the problem sizes get down to 1, each with a cost of c 1 . Part (d) shows the resulting recursion tree. Next, add the costs across each level of the tree. The top level has total cost c 2 n, the next level down has total cost c 2 .n=2/ C c 2 .n=2/ D c 2 n, the level after that has total cost c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ C c 2 .n=4/ D c 2 n, and so on. Each level has twice as many nodes as the level above, but each node contributes only half the cost of a node from the level above. From one level to the next, doubling and halving cancel each other out, so that the cost across each level is the same: c 2 n. In general, the level that is i levels below the top has 2 i nodes, each contributing a cost of c 2 .n=2 i /, so that the i th level below the top has total cost 2 i  c 2 .n=2 i / D c 2 n. The bottom level has n nodes, each contributing a cost of c 1 , for a total cost of c 1 n. The total number of levels of the recursion tree in Figure 2.5 is lg n C 1, where n is the number of leaves, corresponding to the input size. An informal inductive argument justiûes this claim. The base case occurs when n D 1, in which case the tree has only 1 level. Since lg 1 D 0, we have that lg n C 1 gives the correct number of levels. Now assume as an inductive hypothesis that the number of levels of a recursion tree with 2 i leaves is lg 2 i C 1 D i C 1 (since for any value of i , we have that lg 2 i D i ). Because we assume that the input size is an exact power of 2, the next input size to consider is 2 i C1 . A tree with n D 2 i C1 leaves has 1 more 18 It is unlikely that c 1 is exactly the time to solve problems of size 1 and that c 2 n is exactly the time of the divide and combine steps. We’ll look more closely at bounding recurrences in Chapter 4, where we’ll be more careful about this kind of detail. 2.3 Designing algorithms 43 … … (d) (c) (b) (a) T .n/ c 2 n c 2 n c 2 n T .n=2/ T .n=2/ c 2 n=2 c 2 n=2 c 2 n=2 c 2 n=2 T .n=4/ T .n=4/ T .n=4/ T .n=4/ c 2 n=4 c 2 n=4 c 2 n=4 c 2 n=4 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 c 1 n lg n C 1 c 2 n c 2 n c 2 n c 1 n Total: c 2 n lg n C c 1 n Figure 2.5 How to construct a recursion tree for the recurrence (2.4).

Exercises 2.3-1 Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on an array initially containing the sequence h3; 41; 52; 26; 38; 57; 9; 49i. 2.3-2 The test in line 1 of the MERGE-SORT procedure reads <if p  r = rather than <if p ¤ r .= If MERGE-SORT is called with p > r , then the subarray AŒp W r� is empty. Argue that as long as the initial call of MERGE-SORT.A; 1; n/ has n  1, the test <if p ¤ r = sufûces to ensure that no recursive call has p > r . 2.3-3 State a loop invariant for the while loop of lines 12318 of the MERGE procedure.

In order to sort AŒ1 W n�, recursively sort the subarray AŒ1 W n  1� and then insert AŒn� into the sorted subarray AŒ1 W n  1�. Write pseudocode for this recursive version of inser- tion sort. Give a recurrence for its worst-case running time. 2.3-6 Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-4), observe that if the subarray being searched is already sorted, the searching algorithm can check the midpoint of the subarray against v and eliminate half of the subarray from further Problems for Chapter 2 45 consideration. The binary search algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the subarray each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is ‚.lg n/. 2.3-7 The while loop of lines 537 of the I NSERTION-SORT procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray AŒ1 W j  1�. What if insertion sort used a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-6) instead of a linear search? Would that improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to ‚.n lg n/? 2.3-8 Describe an algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another integer x , de- termines whether S contains two elements that sum to exactly x . Your algorithm should take ‚.n lg n/ time in the worst case. Problems 2-1 Insertion sort on small arrays in merge sort Although merge sort runs in ‚.n lg n/ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in ‚.n 2 / worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus it makes sense to coarsen the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufûciently small. Consider a modiûcation to merge sort in which n=k sublists of length k are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where k is a value to be determined. a. Show that insertion sort can sort the n=k sublists, each of length k, in ‚.nk/ worst-case time. b. Show how to merge the sublists in ‚.n lg.n=k// worst-case time. c.

(Hint: Modify merge sort.) 48 Chapter 2 Getting Started Chapter notes In 1968, Knuth published the ûrst of three volumes with the general title The Art of Computer Programming [259, 260, 261]. The ûrst volume ushered in the modern study of computer algorithms with a focus on the analysis of running time. The full series remains an engaging and worthwhile reference for many of the topics presented here. According to Knuth, the word <algorithm= is derived from the name <al-Khowˆ arizmˆ ı,= a ninth-century Persian mathematician. Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] advocated the asymptotic analysis of algorithms 4using notations that Chapter 3 introduces, including ‚-notation4as a means of comparing relative performance. They also popularized the use of recurrence relations to describe the running times of recursive algorithms. Knuth [261] provides an encyclopedic treatment of many sorting algorithms. His comparison of sorting algorithms (page 381) includes exact step-counting analyses, like the one we performed here for insertion sort. Knuth’s discussion of insertion sort encompasses several variations of the algorithm. The most important of these is Shell’s sort, introduced by D. L. Shell, which uses insertion sort on periodic subarrays of the input to produce a faster sorting algorithm. Merge sort is also described by Knuth. He mentions that a mechanical colla- tor capable of merging two decks of punched cards in a single pass was invented in 1938. J. von Neumann, one of the pioneers of computer science, apparently wrote a program for merge sort on the EDVAC computer in 1945. The early history of proving programs correct is described by Gries [200], who credits P. Naur with the ûrst article in this ûeld. Gries attributes loop invariants to R. W. Floyd. The textbook by Mitchell [329] is a good reference on how to prove programs correct. 3 Characterizing Running Times The order of growth of the running time of an algorithm, deûned in Chapter 2, gives a simple way to characterize the algorithm’s efûciency and also allows us to compare it with alternative algorithms. Once the input size n becomes large enough, merge sort, with its ‚.n lg n/ worst-case running time, beats insertion sort, whose worst-case running time is ‚.n 2 /. Although we can sometimes determine the exact running time of an algorithm, as we did for insertion sort in Chapter 2, the extra precision is rarely worth the effort of computing it. For large enough inputs, the multiplicative constants and lower-order terms of an exact running time are dominated by the effects of the input size itself. When we look at input sizes large enough to make relevant only the order of growth of the running time, we are studying the asymptotic efûciency of algo- rithms. That is, we are concerned with how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input in the limit, as the size of the input increases without bound. Usually, an algorithm that is asymptotically more efûcient is the best choice for all but very small inputs. This chapter gives several standard methods for simplifying the asymptotic anal- ysis of algorithms. The next section presents informally the three most commonly used types of <asymptotic notation,= of which we have already seen an example in ‚-notation. It also shows one way to use these asymptotic notations to reason about the worst-case running time of insertion sort. Then we look at asymptotic notations more formally and present several notational con ventions used through- out this book. The last section reviews the behavior of functions that commonly arise when analyzing algorithms. 50 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times 3.1 O-notation, -notation, and ‚-notation When we analyzed the worst-case running time of insertion sort in Chapter 2, we started with the complicated expression c 5 2 C c 6 2 C c 7 2 Í n 2 C  c 1 C c 2 C c 4 C c 5 2  c 6 2  c 7 2 C c 8 Í n  .c 2 C c 4 C c 5 C c 8 / : We then discarded the lower-order terms .c 1 C c 2 C c 4 C c 5 =2  c 6 =2  c 7 =2 C c 8 /n and c 2 C c 4 C c 5 C c 8 , and we also ignored the coefûcient c 5 =2 C c 6 =2 C c 7 =2 of n 2 . That left just the factor n 2 , which we put into ‚-notation as ‚.n 2 /. We use this style to characterize running times of algorithms: discard the lower-order terms and the coefûcient of the leading term, and use a notation that focuses on the rate of growth of the running time. ‚-notation is not the only such <asymptotic notation.= In this section, we’ll see other forms of asymptotic notation as well. We start with intuitive looks at these notations, revisiting insertion sort to see how we can apply them. In the next section, we’ll see the formal deûnitions of our asymptotic notations, along with conventions for using them. Before we get into speciûcs, bear in mind that the asymptotic notations we’ll see are designed so that they characterize functions in general. It so happens that the functions we are most interested in denote the running times of algorithms. But asymptotic notation can apply to functions that characterize some other aspect of algorithms (the amount of space they use, for example), or even to functions that have nothing whatsoever to do with algorithms. -notation O-notation characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows no faster than a certain rate, based on the highest-order term. Consider, for example, the function 7n 3 C 100n 2  20n C 6. Its highest-order term is 7n 3 , and so we say that this function’s rate of growth is n 3 . Because this function grows no faster than n 3 , we can write that it is O.n 3 /. You might be surprised that we can also write that the function 7n 3 C 100n 2  20n C 6 is O.n 4 /. Why? Because the function grows more slowly than n 4 , we are correct in saying that it grows no faster. As you might have guessed, this function is also O.n 5 /, O.n 6 /, and so on. More generally, it is O.n c / for any constant c  3. 3.1 O-notation, �-notation, and ‚-notation 51 -notation �-notation characterizes a lower bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows at least as fast as a certain rate, based 4as in O-notation4on the highest-order term. Because the highest-order term in the function 7n 3 C 100n 2  20n C 6 grows at least as fast as n 3 , this function is �.n 3 /. This function is also �.n 2 / and �.n/. More generally, it is �.n c / for any constant c හ 3. ‚-notation ‚-notation characterizes a tight bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. It says that a function grows precisely at a certain rate, based4once again4on the highest-order term. Put another way, ‚-notation characterizes the rate of growth of the function to within a constant factor from above and to within a constant factor from below. These two constant factors need not be equal. If you can show that a function is both O.f .n// and �.f .n// for some func- tion f .n/, then you have shown that the function is ‚.f .n//. (The next section states this fact as a theorem.) For example, since the function 7n 3 C100n 2 20nC6 is both O.n 3 / and �.n 3 /, it is also ‚.n 3 /. Example: Insertion sort Let’s revisit insertion sort and see how to work with asymptotic notation to charac- terize its ‚.n 2 / worst-case running time without evaluating summations as we did in Chapter 2. Here is the I NSERTION-SORT procedure once again: I NSERTION-SORT .A; n/ 1 for i D 2 to n 2 key D AŒi � 3 // Insert AŒi � into the sorted subarray AŒ1 W i  1�. 4 j D i  1 5 while j > 0 and AŒj � > key 6 AŒj C 1� D AŒj � 7 j D j  1 8 AŒj C 1� D key What can we observe about how the pseudocode operates? The procedure has nested loops. The outer loop is a for loop that runs n  1 times, regardless of the values being sorted. The inner loop is a while loop, but the number of iterations it makes depends on the values being sorted. The loop variable j starts at i  1 52 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times each of the n/3 largest values moves through each of these n/3 positions to somewhere in these n/3 positions AŒ1 W n=3� AŒn=3 C 1 W 2n=3� AŒ2n=3 C 1 W n� Figure 3.1 The �.n 2 / lower bound for insertion sort. If the ûrst n=3 positions contain the n=3 largest values, each of these values must move through each of the middle n=3 positions, one position at a time, to end up somewhere in the last n=3 positions. Since each of n=3 values moves through at least each of n=3 positions, the time taken in this case is at least proportional to .n=3/.n=3/ D n 2 =9, or �.n 2 /. and decreases by 1 in each iteration until either it reaches 0 or AŒj � හ key. For a given value of i , the while loop might iterate 0 times, i  1 times, or anywhere in between. The body of the while loop (lines 637) takes constant time per iteration of the while loop. These observations sufûce to deduce an O.n 2 / running time for any case of I NSERTION-SORT, giving us a blanket statement that covers all inputs. The run- ning time is dominated by the inner loop. Because each of the n  1 iterations of the outer loop causes the inner loop to iterate at most i  1 times, and because i is at most n, the total number of iterations of the inner loop is at most .n  1/.n  1/, which is less than n 2 . Since each iteration of the inner loop takes constant time, the total time spent in the inner loop is at most a constant times n 2 , or O.n 2 /. With a little creativity, we can also see that the worst-case running time of I NSERTION-SORT is �.n 2 /. By saying that the worst-case running time of an algorithm is �.n 2 /, we mean that for every input size n above a certain threshold, there is at least one input of size n for which the algorithm takes at least cn 2 time, for some positive constant c . It does not necessarily mean that the algorithm takes at least cn 2 time for all inputs. Let’s now see why the worst-case running time of I NSERTION-SORT is �.n 2 /. For a value to end up to the right of where it started, it must have been moved in line 6. In fact, for a value to end up k positions to the right of where it started, line 6 must have executed k times. As Figure 3.1 shows, let’s assume that n is a multiple of 3 so that we can divide the array A into groups of n=3 positions. Suppose that in the input to I NSERTION-SORT, the n=3 largest values occupy the ûrst n=3 array positions AŒ1 W n=3�. (It does not matter what relative order they have within the ûrst n=3 positions.) Once the array has been sorted, each of these n=3 values ends up somewhere in the last n=3 positions AŒ2n=3 C 1 W n�. For that to happen, each of these n=3 values must pass through each of the middle n=3 positions AŒn=3 C 1 W 2n=3�. Each of these n=3 values passes through these middle 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deﬁnitions 53 n=3 positions one position at a time, by at least n=3 executions of line 6. Because at least n=3 values have to pass through at least n=3 positions, the time taken by I NSERTION-SORT in the worst case is at least proportional to .n=3/.n=3/ D n 2 =9, which is �.n 2 /. Because we have shown that I NSERTION-SORT runs in O.n 2 / time in all cases and that there is an input that makes it take �.n 2 / time, we can conclude that the worst-case running time of I NSERTION-SORT is ‚.n 2 /. It does not matter that the constant factors for upper and lower bounds might differ. What matters is that we have characterized the worst-case running time to within constant factors (discounting lower-order terms). This argument does not show that I NSERTION- SORT runs in ‚.n 2 / time in all cases. Indeed, we saw in Chapter 2 that the best- case running time is ‚.n/. Exercises 3.1-1 Modify the lower-bound argument for insertion sort to handle input sizes that are not necessarily a multiple of 3. 3.1-2 Using reasoning similar to what we used for insertion sort, analyze the running time of the selection sort algorithm from Exercise 2.2-2. 3.1-3 Suppose that ˛ is a fraction in the range 0 < ˛ < 1. Show how to generalize the lower-bound argument for insertion sort to consider an input in which the ˛ n largest values start in the ûrst ˛ n positions. What additional restriction do you need to put on ˛? What value of ˛ maximizes the number of times that the ˛ n largest values must pass through each of the middle .1  2˛/n array positions? 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deûnitions Having seen asymptotic notation informally, let’s get more formal. The notations we use to describe the asymptotic running time of an algorithm are deûned in terms of functions whose domains are typically the set N of natural numbers or the set R of real numbers. Such notations are convenient for describing a running- time function T .n/. This section deûnes the basic asymptotic notations and also introduces some common <proper= notational abuses. 54 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times (a) (b) (c) n n n n 0 n 0 n 0 f .n/ D ‚.g.n// f .n/ D O.g.n// f .n/ D �.g.n// f .n/ f .n/ f .n/ cg.n/ cg.n/ c 1 g.n/ c 2 g.n/ Figure 3.2 Graphic examples of the O, �, and ‚ notations. In each part, the value of n 0 shown is the minimum possible value, but any greater value also works. (a) O-notation gives an upper bound for a function to within a constant factor. We write f .n/ D O.g.n// if there are positive constants n 0 and c such that at and to the right of n 0 , the value of f .n/ always lies on or be- low cg.n/. (b) �-notation gives a lower bound for a function to within a const ant factor. We write f .n/ D �.g.n// if there are positive constants n 0 and c such that at and to the right of n 0 , the value of f .n/ always lies on or above cg.n/. (c) ‚-notation bounds a function to within constant factors. We write f .n/ D ‚.g.n// if there exist positive constants n 0 , c 1 , and c 2 such that at and to the right of n 0 , the value of f .n/ always lies between c 1 g.n/ and c 2 g.n/ inclusive. O-notation As we saw in Section 3.1, O-notation describes an asymptotic upper bound. We use O-notation to give an upper bound on a function, to within a constant factor. Here is the formal deûnition of O-notation. For a given function g.n/, we denote by O.g.n// (pronounced <big-oh of g of n= or sometimes just <oh of g of n=) the set of functions O.g.n// D ff .n/ W there exist positive constants c and n 0 such that 0 හ f .n/ හ cg.n/ for all n  n 0 g : 1 A function f .n/ belongs to the set O.g.n// if there exists a positive constant c such that f .n/ හ cg.n/ for sufûciently large n. Figure 3.2(a) shows the intuition behind O-notation. For all values n at and to the right of n 0 , the value of the function f .n/ is on or below cg.n/. The deûnition of O.g.n// requires that every function f .n/ in the set O.g.n// be asymptotically nonnegative: f .n/ must be nonnegative whenever n is sufû- ciently large. (An asymptotically positive function is one that is positive for all 1 Within set notation, a colon means <such that.= 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deﬁnitions 55 sufûciently large n.) Consequently, the function g.n/ itself must be asymptotically nonnegative, or else the set O.g.n// is empty. We therefore assume that every function used within O-notation is asymptotically nonnegative. This assumption holds for the other asymptotic notations deûned in this chapter as well. You might be surprised that we deûne O-notation in terms of sets. Indeed, you might expect that we would write <f .n/ 2 O.g.n//= to indicate that f .n/ be- longs to the set O.g.n//. Instead, we usually write <f .n/ D O.g.n//= and say <f .n/ is big-oh of g.n/= to express the same notion. Although it may seem con- fusing at ûrst to abuse equality in this way, we’ll see later in this section that doing so has its advantages. Let’s explore an example of how to use the formal deûnition of O-notation to justify our practice of discarding lower-order terms and ignoring the constant coef- ûcient of the highest-order term. We’ll show that 4n 2 C100n C500 D O.n 2 /, even though the lower-order terms have much larger coefûcients than the leading term. We need to ûnd positive constants c and n 0 such that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 හ cn 2 for all n  n 0 . Dividing both sides by n 2 gives 4 C 100=n C 500=n 2 හ c . This inequality is satisûed for many choices of c and n 0 . For example, if we choose n 0 D 1, then this inequality holds for c D 604. If we choose n 0 D 10, then c D 19 works, and choosing n 0 D 100 allows us to use c D 5:05. We can also use the formal deûnition of O-notation to show that the function n 3  100n 2 does not belong to the set O.n 2 /, even though the coefûcient of n 2 is a large negative number. If we had n 3  100n 2 D O.n 2 /, then there would be positive constants c and n 0 such that n 3  100n 2 හ cn 2 for all n  n 0 . Again, we divide both sides by n 2 , giving n  100 හ c . Regardless of what value we choose for the constant c , this inequality does not hold for any value of n > c C 100. -notation Just as O-notation provides an asymptotic upper bound on a function, �-notation provides an asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g.n/, we denote by �.g.n// (pronounced <big-omega of g of n= or sometimes just <omega of g of n=) the set of functions �.g.n// D ff .n/ W there exist positive constants c and n 0 such that 0 හ cg.n/ හ f .n/ for all n  n 0 g : Figure 3.2(b) shows the intuition behind �-notation. For all values n at or to the right of n 0 , the value of f .n/ is on or above cg.n/. We’ve already shown that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D O.n 2 /. Now let’s show that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D �.n 2 /. We need to ûnd positive constants c and n 0 such that 4n 2 C 100n C 500  cn 2 for all n  n 0 . As before, we divide both sides by n 2 , 56 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times giving 4 C 100=n C 500=n 2  c . This inequality holds when n 0 is any positive integer and c D 4. What if we had subtracted the lower-order terms from the 4n 2 term instead of adding them? What if we had a small coefûcient for the n 2 term? The function would still be �.n 2 /. For example, let’s show that n 2 =100  100n  500 D �.n 2 /. Dividing by n 2 gives 1=100  100=n  500=n 2  c . We can choose any value for n 0 that is at least 10,005 and ûnd a positive value for c . For example, when n 0 D 10,005, we can choose c D 2:49  10 9 . Yes, that’s a tiny value for c , but it is positive. If we select a larger value for n 0 , we can also increase c . For example, if n 0 D 100,000, then we can choose c D 0:0089. The higher the value of n 0 , the closer to the coefûcient 1=100 we can choose c . ‚-notation We use ‚-notation for asymptotically tight bounds. For a given function g.n/, we denote by ‚.g.n// (<theta of g of n=) the set of functions ‚.g.n// D ff .n/ W there exist positive constants c 1 , c 2 , and n 0 such that 0 හ c 1 g.n/ හ f .n/ හ c 2 g.n/ for all n  n 0 g : Figure 3.2(c) shows the intuition behind ‚-notation. For all values of n at and to the right of n 0 , the value of f .n/ lies at or above c 1 g.n/ and at or below c 2 g.n/. In other words, for all n  n 0 , the function f .n/ is equal to g.n/ to within constant factors. The deûnitions of O-, �-, and ‚-notations lead to the following theorem, whose proof we leave as Exercise 3.2-4. Theorem 3.1 For any two functions f .n/ and g.n/, we have f .n/ D ‚.g.n// if and only if f .n/ D O.g.n// and f .n/ D �.g.n//. We typically apply Theorem 3.1 to prove asymptotically tight bounds from asymp- totic upper and lower bounds. Asymptotic notation and running times When you use asymptotic notation to characterize an algorithm’s running time, make sure that the asymptotic notation you use is as precise as possible without overstating which running time it applies to. Here are some examples of using asymptotic notation properly and improperly to characterize running times. Let’s start with insertion sort. We can correctly say that insertion sort’s worst- case running time is O.n 2 /, �.n 2 /, and4due to Theorem 3.14‚.n 2 /. Although 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deﬁnitions 57 all three ways to characterize the worst-case running times are correct, the ‚.n 2 / bound is the most precise and hence the most preferred. We can also correctly say that insertion sort’s best-case running time is O.n/, �.n/, and ‚.n/, again with ‚.n/ the most precise and therefore the most preferred. Here is what we cannot correctly say: insertion sort’s running time is ‚.n 2 /. That is an overstatement because by omitting <worst-case= from the statement, we’re left with a blanket statement covering all cases. The error here is that inser- tion sort does not run in ‚.n 2 / time in all cases since, as we’ve seen, it runs in ‚.n/ time in the best case. We can correctly say that insertion sort’s running time is O.n 2 /, however, because in all cases, its running time grows no faster than n 2 . When we say O.n 2 / instead of ‚.n 2 /, there is no problem in having cases whose running time grows more slowly than n 2 . Likewise, we cannot correctly say that insertion sort’s running time is ‚.n/, but we can say that its running time is �.n/. How about merge sort? Since merge sort runs in ‚.n lg n/ time in all cases, we can just say that its running time is ‚.n lg n/ without specifying worst-case, best-case, or any other case. People occasionally conüate O-notation with ‚-notation by mistakenly using O-notation to indicate an asymptotically tight bound. They say things like <an O.n lg n/-time algorithm runs faster than an O.n 2 /-time algorithm.= Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. Since O-notation denotes only an asymptotic upper bound, that so-called O.n 2 /-time algorithm might actually run in ‚.n/ time. You should be careful to choose the appropriate asymptotic notation. If you want to indicate an asymptotically tight bound, use ‚-notation. We typically use asymptotic notation to provide the simplest and most precise bounds possible. For example, if an algorithm has a running time of 3n 2 C 20n in all cases, we use asymptotic notation to write that its running time is ‚.n 2 /. Strictly speaking, we are also correct in writing that the running time is O.n 3 / or ‚.3n 2 C 20n/. Neither of these expressions is as useful as writing ‚.n 2 / in this case, however: O.n 3 / is less precise than ‚.n 2 / if the running time is 3n 2 C 20n, and ‚.3n 2 C 20n/ introduces complexity that obscures the order of growth. By writing the simplest and most precise bound, such as ‚.n 2 /, we can categorize and compare different algorithms. Throughout the book, you will see asymptotic running times that are almost always based on polynomials and logarithms: func- tions such as n, n lg 2 n, n 2 lg n, or n 1=2 . You will also see some other functions, such as exponentials, lg lg n, and lg  n (see Section 3.3). It is usually fairly easy to compare the rates of growth of these functions. Problem 3-3 gives you good practice. 58 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times Asymptotic notation in equations and inequalities Although we formally deûne asymptotic notation in terms of sets, we use the equal sign (D) instead of the set membership sign (2) within formulas. For example, we wrote that 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D O.n 2 /. We might also write 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C ‚.n/. How do we interpret such formulas? When the asymptotic notation stands alone (that is, not within a larger formula) on the right-hand side of an equation (or inequality), as in 4n 2 C 100n C 500 D O.n 2 /, the equal sign means set membership: 4n 2 C 100n C 500 2 O.n 2 /. In general, however, when asymptotic notation appears in a formula, we interpret it as standing for some anonymous function that we do not care to name. For example, the formula 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C ‚.n/ means that 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C f .n/, where f .n/ 2 ‚.n/. In this case, we let f .n/ D 3n C 1, which indeed belongs to ‚.n/. Using asymptotic notation in this manner can help eliminate inessential detail and clutter in an equation. For example, in Chapter 2 we expressed the worst-case running time of merge sort as the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ : If we are interested only in the asymptotic behavior of T .n/, there is no point in specifying all the lower-order terms exactly, because they are all understood to be included in the anonymous function denoted by the term ‚.n/. The number of anonymous functions in an expression is understood to be equal to the number of times the asymptotic notation appears. For example, in the ex- pression n X i D1 O.i / ; there is only a single anonymous function (a function of i ). This expression is thus not the same as O.1/ C O.2/ C    C O.n/, which doesn’t really have a clean interpretation. In some cases, asymptotic notation appears on the left-hand side of an equation, as in 2n 2 C ‚.n/ D ‚.n 2 / : Interpret such equations using the following rule: No matter how the anonymous functions are chosen on the left of the equal sign, there is a way to choose the anonymous functions on the right of the equal sign to make the equation valid. Thus, our example means that for any function f .n/ 2 ‚.n/, there is some function g.n/ 2 ‚.n 2 / such that 2n 2 Cf .n/ D g.n/ for all n. In other words, the right-hand side of an equation provides a coarser level of detail than the left-hand side. 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deﬁnitions 59 We can chain together a number of such relationships, as in 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D 2n 2 C ‚.n/ D ‚.n 2 / : By the rules above, interpret each equation separately. The ûrst equation says that there is some function f .n/ 2 ‚.n/ such that 2n 2 C3n C1 D 2n 2 C f .n/ for all n. The second equation says that for any function g.n/ 2 ‚.n/ (such as the f .n/ just mentioned), there is some function h.n/ 2 ‚.n 2 / such that 2n 2 C g.n/ D h.n/ for all n. This interpretation implies that 2n 2 C 3n C 1 D ‚.n 2 /, which is what the chaining of equations intuitively says. Proper abuses of asymptotic notation Besides the abuse of equality to mean set membership, which we now see has a precise mathematical interpretation, another abuse of asymptotic notation occurs when the variable tending toward 1 must be inferred from context. For example, when we say O.g.n//, we can assume that we’re interested in the growth of g.n/ as n grows, and if we say O.g.m// we’re talking about the growth of g.m/ as m grows. The free variable in the expression indicates what variable is going to 1. The most common situation requiring contextual knowledge of which variable tends to 1 occurs when the function inside the asymptotic notation is a constant, as in the expression O.1/. We cannot infer from the expression which variable is going to 1, because no variable appears there. The context must disambiguate. For example, if the equation using asymptotic notation is f .n/ D O.1/, it’s apparent that the variable we’re interested in is n. Knowing from context that the variable of interest is n, however, allows us to make perfect sense of the expression by using the formal deûnition of O-notation: the expression f .n/ D O.1/ means that the function f .n/ is bounded from above by a constant as n goes to 1. Technically, it might be less ambiguous if we explicitly indicated the variable tending to 1 in the asymptotic notation itself, but that would clutter the notation. Instead, we simply ensure that the context makes it clear which variable (or variables) tend to 1. When the function inside the asymptotic notation is bounded by a positive con- stant, as in T .n/ D O.1/, we often abuse asymptotic notation in yet another way, especially when stating recurrences. We may write something like T .n/ D O.1/ for n < 3. According to the formal deûnition of O-notation, this statement is meaningless, because the deûnition only says that T .n/ is bounded above by a positive constant c for n  n 0 for some n 0 > 0. The value of T .n/ for n < n 0 need not be so bounded. Thus, in the example T .n/ D O.1/ for n < 3, we cannot infer any constraint on T .n/ when n < 3, because it might be that n 0 > 3. What is conventionally meant when we say T .n/ D O.1/ for n < 3 is that there exists a positive constant c such that T .n/ හ c for n < 3. This convention saves 60 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times us the trouble of naming the bounding constant, allowing it to remain anonymous while we focus on more important variables in an analysis. Similar abuses occur with the other asymptotic notations. For example, T .n/ D ‚.1/ for n < 3 means that T .n/ is bounded above and below by positive constants when n < 3. Occasionally, the function describing an algorithm’s running time may not be deûned for certain input sizes, for example, when an algorithm assumes that the input size is an exact power of 2. We still use asymptotic notation to describe the growth of the running time, understanding that any constraints apply only when the function is deûned. For example, suppose that f .n/ is deûned only on a subset of the natural or nonnegative real numbers. Then f .n/ D O.g.n// means that the bound 0 හ T .n/ හ cg.n/ in the deûnition of O-notation holds for all n  n 0 over the domain of f .n/, that is, where f .n/ is deûned. This abuse is rarely pointed out, since what is meant is generally clear from context. In mathematics, it’s okay4and often desirable4to abuse a notation, as long as we don’t misuse it. If we understand precisely what is meant by the abuse and don’t draw incorrect conclusions, it can simplify our mathematical language, contribute to our higher-level understanding, and help us focus on what really matters. o-notation The asymptotic upper bound provided by O-notation may or may not be asymp- totically tight. The bound 2n 2 D O.n 2 / is asymptotically tight, but the bound 2n D O.n 2 / is not. We use o-notation to denote an upper bound that is not asymp- totically tight. We formally deûne o.g.n// (<little-oh of g of n=) as the set o.g.n// D ff .n/ W for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant n 0 > 0 such that 0 හ f .n/ < cg.n/ for all n  n 0 g : For example, 2n D o.n 2 /, but 2n 2 ¤ o.n 2 /. The deûnitions of O-notation and o-notation are similar. The main difference is that in f .n/ D O.g.n//, the bound 0 හ f .n/ හ cg.n/ holds for some con- stant c > 0, but in f .n/ D o.g.n//, the bound 0 හ f .n/ < cg.n/ holds for all constants c > 0. Intuitively, in o-notation, the function f .n/ becomes insigniûcant relative to g.n/ as n gets large: lim n!1 f .n/ g.n/ D 0 : Some authors use this limit as a deûnition of the o-notation, but the deûnition in this book also restricts the anonymous functions to be asymptotically nonnegative. 3.2 Asymptotic notation: formal deﬁnitions 61 !-notation By analogy, !-notation is to �-notation as o-notation is to O-notation. We use !-notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. One way to deûne it is by f .n/ 2 !.g.n// if and only if g.n/ 2 o.f .n// : Formally, however, we deûne !.g.n// (<little-omega of g of n=) as the set !.g.n// D ff .n/ W for any positive constant c > 0, there exists a constant n 0 > 0 such that 0 හ cg.n/ < f .n/ for all n  n 0 g : Where the deûnition of o-notation says that f .n/ < cg.n/ , the deûnition of !-notation says the opposite: that cg.n/ < f .n/ . For examples of !-notation, we have n 2 =2 D !.n/, but n 2 =2 ¤ !.n 2 /. The relation f .n/ D !.g.n// implies that lim n!1 f .n/ g.n/ D 1 ; if the limit exists. That is, f .n/ becomes arbitrarily large relative to g.n/ as n gets large. Comparing functions Many of the relational properties of real numbers apply to asymptotic comparisons as well. For the following, assume that f .n/ and g.n/ are asymptotically positive. Transitivity: f .n/ D ‚.g.n// and g.n/ D ‚.h.n// imply f .n/ D ‚.h.n// ; f .n/ D O.g.n// and g.n/ D O.h.n// imply f .n/ D O.h.n// ; f .n/ D �.g.n// and g.n/ D �.h.n// imply f .n/ D �.h.n// ; f .n/ D o.g.n// and g.n/ D o.h.n// imply f .n/ D o.h.n// ; f .n/ D !.g.n// and g.n/ D !.h.n// imply f .n/ D !.h.n// : Reüexivity: f .n/ D ‚.f .n// ; f .n/ D O.f .n// ; f .n/ D �.f .n// : Symmetry: f .n/ D ‚.g.n// if and only if g.n/ D ‚.f .n// : 62 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times Transpose symmetry: f .n/ D O.g.n// if and only if g.n/ D �.f .n// ; f .n/ D o.g.n// if and only if g.n/ D !.f .n// : Because these properties hold for asymptotic notations, we can draw an analogy between the asymptotic comparison of two functions f and g and the comparison of two real numbers a and b: f .n/ D O.g.n// is like a හ b ; f .n/ D �.g.n// is like a  b ; f .n/ D ‚.g.n// is like a D b ; f .n/ D o.g.n// is like a < b ; f .n/ D !.g.n// is like a > b : We say that f .n/ is asymptotically smaller than g.n/ if f .n/ D o.g.n//, and f .n/ is asymptotically larger than g.n/ if f .n/ D !.g.n//. One property of real numbers, however, does not carry over to asymptotic nota- tion: Trichotomy: For any two real numbers a and b, exactly one of the following must hold: a < b, a D b, or a > b. Although any two real numbers can be compared, not all functions are asymptot- ically comparable. That is, for two functions f .n/ and g.n/, it may be the case that neither f .n/ D O.g.n// nor f .n/ D �.g.n// holds. For example, we cannot compare the functions n and n 1Csin n using asymptotic notation, since the value of the exponent in n 1Csin n oscillates between 0 and 2, taking on all values in between. Exercises 3.2-1 Let f .n/ and g.n/ be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic deû- nition of ‚-notation, prove that max ff .n/; g.n/g D ‚.f .n/ C g.n//. 3.2-2 Explain why the statement, <The running time of algorithm A is at least O.n 2 /,= is meaningless. 3.2-3 Is 2 nC1 D O.2 n /? Is 2 2n D O.2 n /? 3.2-4 Prove Theorem 3.1. 3.3 Standard notations and common functions 63 3.2-5 Prove that the running time of an algorithm is ‚.g.n// if and only if its worst-case running time is O.g.n// and its best-case running time is �.g.n//. 3.2-6 Prove that o.g.n// \\ !.g.n// is the empty set. 3.2-7 We can extend our notation to the case of two parameters n and m that can go to 1 independently at different rates. For a given function g.n; m/, we denote by O.g.n; m// the set of functions O.g.n; m// D ff .n; m/ W there exist positive constants c , n 0 , and m 0 such that 0 හ f .n; m/ හ cg.n; m/ for all n  n 0 or m  m 0 g : Give corresponding deûnitions for �.g.n; m// and ‚.g.n; m//. 3.3 Standard notations and common functions This section reviews some standard mathematical functions and notations and ex- plores the relationships among them. It also illustrates the use of the asymptotic notations. Monotonicity A function f .n/ is monotonically increasing if m හ n implies f .m/ හ f .n/. Similarly, it is monotonically decreasing if m හ n implies f .m/  f .n/. A func- tion f .n/ is strictly increasing if m < n implies f .m/ < f .n/ and strictly de- creasing if m < n implies f .m/ > f .n/. Floors and ceilings For any real number x , we denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x by bx c (read <the üoor of x =) and the least integer greater than or equal to x by dx e (read <the ceiling of x =). The üoor function is monotonically increasing, as is the ceiling function. Floors and ceilings obey the following properties. For any integer n, we have bnc D n D dne : (3.1) For all real x , we have 64 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times x  1 < bx c හ x හ dx e < x C 1 : (3.2) We also have  bx c D dx e ; (3.3) or equivalently,  dx e D bx c : (3.4) For any real number x  0 and integers a; b > 0, we have å dx=ae b æ D å x ab æ ; (3.5) ç bx=ac b è D ç x ab è ; (3.6) å a b æ හ a C .b  1/ b ; (3.7) ç a b è  a  .b  1/ b : (3.8) For any integer n and real number x , we have bn C x c D n C bx c ; (3.9) dn C x e D n C dx e : (3.10) Modular arithmetic For any integer a and any positive integer n, the value a mod n is the remainder (or residue) of the quotient a=n: a mod n D a  n ba=nc : (3.11) It follows that හ a mod n < n ; (3.12) even when a is negative. Given a well-deûned notion of the remainder of one integer when divided by an- other, it is convenient to provide special notation to indicate equality of remainders. If .a mod n/ D .b mod n/, we write a D b .mod n/ and say that a is equivalent to b, modulo n. In other words, a D b .mod n/ if a and b have the same remain- der when divided by n. Equivalently, a D b .mod n/ if and only if n is a divisor of b  a. We write a ¤ b .mod n/ if a is not equivalent to b, modulo n. 3.3 Standard notations and common functions 65 Polynomials Given a nonnegative integer d , a polynomial in n of degree d is a function p.n/ of the form p.n/ D d X i D0 a i n i ; where the constants a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a d are the coefﬁcients of the polynomial and a d ¤ 0. A polynomial is asymptotically positive if and only if a d > 0. For an asymptotically positive polynomial p.n/ of degree d , we have p.n/ D ‚.n d /. For any real constant a  0, the function n a is monotonically increasing, and for any real constant a හ 0, the function n a is monotonically decreasing. We say that a function f .n/ is polynomially bounded if f .n/ D O.n k / for some constant k. Exponentials For all real a > 0, m, and n, we have the following identities: a 0 D 1 ; a 1 D a ; a 1 D 1=a ; .a m / n D a mn ; .a m / n D .a n / m ; a m a n D a mCn : For all n and a  1, the function a n is monotonically increasing in n. When convenient, we assume that 0 0 D 1. We can relate the rates of growth of polynomials and exponentials by the fol- lowing fact. For all real constants a > 1 and b, we have lim n!1 n b a n D 0 ; from which we can conclude that b D o.a n / : (3.13) Thus, any exponential function with a base strictly greater than 1 grows faster than any polynomial function. Using e to denote 2:71828 : : :, the base of the natural-logarithm function, we have for all real x , e x D 1 C x C x 2 2Š C x 3 3Š C    D 1 X i D0 x i i Š ; 66 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times where <Š= denotes the factorial function deûned later in this section. For all real x , we have the inequality C x හ e x ; (3.14) where equality holds only when x D 0. When jx j හ 1, we have the approximation 1 C x හ e x හ 1 C x C x 2 : (3.15) When x ! 0, the approximation of e x by 1 C x is quite good: e x D 1 C x C ‚.x 2 / : (In this equation, the asymptotic notation is used to describe the limiting behavior as x ! 0 rather than as x ! 1.) We have for all x , lim n!1  1 C x n Í n D e x : (3.16) Logarithms We use the following notations: lg n D log 2 n (binary logarithm) , ln n D log e n (natural logarithm) , lg k n D .lg n/ k (exponentiation) , lg lg n D lg.lg n/ (composition) . We adopt the following notational convention: in the absence of parentheses, a logarithm function applies only to the next term in the formula, so that lg n C 1 means .lg n/ C 1 and not lg.n C 1/. For any constant b > 1, the function log b n is undeûned if n හ 0, strictly increasing if n > 0, negative if 0 < n < 1, positive if n > 1, and 0 if n D 1. For all real a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, and n, we have a D b log b a ; (3.17) log c .ab/ D log c a C log c b ; (3.18) log b a n D n log b a ; log b a D log c a log c b ; (3.19) log b .1=a/ D  log b a ; (3.20) log b a D 1 log a b ; a log b c D c log b a ; (3.21) where, in each equation above, logarithm bases are not 1. 3.3 Standard notations and common functions 67 By equation (3.19), changing the base of a logarithm from one constant to an- other changes the value of the logarithm by only a constant factor. Consequently, we often use the notation <lg n= when we don’t care about constant factors, such as in O-notation. Computer scientists ûnd 2 to be the most natural base for loga- rithms because so many algorithms and data structures involve splitting a problem into two parts. There is a simple series expansion for ln.1 C x/ when jx j < 1: ln.1 C x/ D x  x 2 2 C x 3 3  x 4 4 C x 5 5     : (3.22) We also have the following inequalities for x > 1: x 1 C x හ ln.1 C x/ හ x ; (3.23) where equality holds only for x D 0. We say that a function f .n/ is polylogarithmically bounded if f .n/ D O.lg k n/ for some constant k. We can relate the growth of polynomials and polylogarithms by substituting lg n for n and 2 a for a in equation (3.13). For all real constants a > 0 and b, we have lg b n D o.n a / : (3.24) Thus, any positive polynomial function grows faster than any polylogarithmic func- tion. Factorials The notation nŠ (read <n factorial=) is deûned for integers n  0 as nŠ D ( 1 if n D 0 ; n  .n  1/Š if n > 0 : Thus, nŠ D 1  2  3    n. A weak upper bound on the factorial function is nŠ හ n n , since each of the n terms in the factorial product is at most n. Stirling’s approximation, nŠ D p 2� n  n e Í n Î 1 C ‚ Î 1 n ÏÏ ; (3.25) where e is the base of the natural logarithm, gives us a tighter upper bound, and a lower bound as well. Exercise 3.3-4 asks you to prove the three facts nŠ D o.n n / ; (3.26) nŠ D !.2 n / ; (3.27) lg.nŠ/ D ‚.n lg n/ ; (3.28) 68 Chapter 3 Characterizing Running Times where Stirling’s approximation is helpful in proving equation (3.28). The following equation also holds for all n  1: nŠ D p 2� n  n e Í n e ˛ n (3.29) where 1 12n C 1 < ˛ n < 1 12n : Functional iteration We use the notation f .i / .n/ to denote the function f .n/ iteratively applied i times to an initial value of n. Formally, let f .n/ be a function over the reals. For non- negative integers i , we recursively deûne f .i / .n/ D ( n if i D 0 ; f .f .i 1/ .n// if i > 0 : (3.30) For example, if f .n/ D 2n, then f .i / .n/ D 2 i n. The iterated logarithm function We use the notation lg  n (read <log star of n=) to denote the iterated logarithm, de- ûned as follows. Let lg .i / n be as deûned above, with f .n/ D lg n. Because the log- arithm of a nonpositive number is undeûned, lg .i / n is deûned only if lg .i 1/ n > 0. Be sure to distinguish lg .i / n (the logarithm function applied i times in succession, starting with argument n) from lg i n (the logarithm of n raised to the i th power). Then we deûne the iterated logarithm function as lg  n D min ˚ i  0 W lg .i / n හ 1  : The iterated logarithm is a very slowly growing function: lg  2 D 1 ; lg  4 D 2 ; lg  16 D 3 ; lg  65536 D 4 ; lg  .2 65536 / D 5 : Since the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated to be about 10 80 , which is much less than 2 65536 D 10 65536= lg 10  10 19;728 , we rarely encounter an input size n for which lg  n > 5. 3.3 Standard notations and common functions 69 Fibonacci numbers We deûne the Fibonacci numbers F i , for i  0, as follows: F i D Ĩ 0 if i D 0 ; 1 if i D 1 ; F i 1 C F i 2 if i  2 : (3.31) Thus, after the ûrst two, each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous ones, yielding the sequence 0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; : : : : Fibonacci numbers are related to the golden ratio � and its conjugate y � , which are the two roots of the equation 2 D x C 1 : As Exercise 3.3-7 asks you to prove, the golden ratio is given by � D 1 C p 5 2 (3.32) D 1:61803 : : : ; and its conjugate, by y � D 1  p 5 2 (3.33) D :61803 : : : : Speciûcally, we have F i D � i  y � i p 5 ; which can be proved by induction (Exercise 3.3-8).

Bach- mann in 1892. The o-notation was invented by E. Landau in 1909 for his discussion of the distribution of prime numbers. The � and ‚ notations were advocated by Knuth [265] to correct the popular, but technically sloppy, practice in the litera- ture of using O-notation for both upper and lower bounds. As noted earlier in this chapter, many people continue to use the O-notation where the ‚-notation is more technically precise. The soft-oh notation e O in Problem 3-6 was introduced Notes for Chapter 3 75 by Babai, Luks, and Seress [31], although it was originally written as O. Some authors now deûne e O.g.n// as ignoring factors that are logarithmic in g.n/, rather than in n. With this deûnition, we can say that n2 n D e O.2 n /, but with the deû- nition in Problem 3-6, this statement is not true. Further discussion of the history and development of asymptotic notations appears in works by Knuth [259, 265] and Brassard and Bratley [70]. Not all authors deûne the asymptotic notations in the same way, although the various deûnitions agree in most common situations. Some of the alternative def- initions encompass functions that are not asymptotically nonnegative, as long as their absolute values are appropriately bounded. Equation (3.29) is due to Robbins [381]. Other properties of elementary math- ematical functions can be found in any good mathematical reference, such as Abramowitz and Stegun [1] or Zwillinger [468], or in a calculus book, such as Apostol [19] or Thomas et al. [433]. Knuth [259] and Graham, Knuth, and Patash- nik [199] contain a wealth of material on discrete mathematics as used in computer science. 4 Divide-and-Conquer The divide-and-conquer method is a powerful strategy for designing asymptotically efûcient algorithms. We saw an example of divide-and-conquer in Section 2.3.1 when learning about merge sort. In this chapter, we’ll explore applications of the divide-and-conquer method and acquire valuable mathematical tools that you can use to solve the recurrences that arise when analyzing divide-and-conquer algo- rithms. Recall that for divide-and-conquer, you solve a given problem (instance) recur- sively. If the problem is small enough4the base case4you just solve it directly without recursing. Otherwise4the recursive case4you perform three character- istic steps: Divide the problem into one or more subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. Combine the subproblem solutions to form a solution to the original problem. A divide-and-conquer algorithm breaks down a large problem into smaller sub- problems, which themselves may be broken down into even smaller subproblems, and so forth. The recursion bottoms out when it reaches a base case and the sub- problem is small enough to solve directly without further recursing. Recurrences To analyze recursive divide-and-conquer algorithms, we’ll need some mathemat- ical tools. A recurrence is an equation that describes a function in terms of its value on other, typically smaller, arguments. Recurrences go hand in hand with the divide-and-conquer method because they give us a natural way to characterize the running times of recursive algorithms mathematically. You saw an example of a recurrence in Section 2.3.2 when we analyzed the worst-case running time of merge sort. Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer 77 For the divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithms presented in Sec- tions 4.1 and 4.2, we’ll derive recurrences that describe their worst-case running times. To understand why these two divide-and-conquer algorithms perform the way they do, you’ll need to learn how to solve the recurrences that describe their running times. Sections 4.334.7 teach several methods for solving recurrences. These sections also explore the mathematics behind recurrences, which can give you stronger intuition for designing your own divide-and-conquer algorithms. We want to get to the algorithms as soon as possible. So, let’s just cover a few recurrence basics now, and then we’ll look more deeply at recurrences, especially how to solve them, after we see the matrix-multiplication examples. The general form of a recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a function over the integers or reals using the function itself. It contains two or more cases, depending on the argument. If a case involves the recursive invocation of the function on different (usually smaller) inputs, it is a recursive case. If a case does not involve a recursive invocation, it is a base case. There may be zero, one, or many functions that satisfy the statement of the recurrence. The recurrence is well deﬁned if there is at least one function that satisûes it, and ill deﬁned otherwise. Algorithmic recurrences We’ll be particularly interested in recurrences that describe the running times of divide-and-conquer algorithms. A recurrence T .n/ is algorithmic if, for every sufûciently large threshold constant n 0 > 0, the following two properties hold: 1. For all n < n 0 , we have T .n/ D ‚.1/. 2. For all n  n 0 , every path of recursion terminates in a deûned base case within a ûnite number of recursive invocations. Similar to how we sometimes abuse asymptotic notation (see page 60), when a function is not deûned for all arguments, we understand that this deûnition is con- strained to values of n for which T .n/ is deûned. Why would a recurrence T .n/ that represents a (correct) divide-and-conquer al- gorithm’s worst-case running time satisfy these properties for all sufûciently large threshold constants? The ûrst property says that there exist constants c 1 ; c 2 such that 0 < c 1 හ T .n/ හ c 2 for n < n 0 . For every legal input, the algorithm must output the solution to the problem it’s solving in ûnite time (see Section 1.1). Thus we can let c 1 be the minimum amount of time to call and return from a procedure, which must be positive, because machine instructions need to be executed to in- voke a procedure. The running time of the algorithm may not be deûned for some values of n if there are no legal inputs of that size, but it must be deûned for at least one, or else the <algorithm= doesn’t solve any problem. Thus we can let c 2 be the algorithm’s maximum running time on any input of size n < n 0 , where n 0 is 78 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer sufûciently large that the algorithm solves at least one problem of size less than n 0 . The maximum is well deûned, since there are at most a ûnite number of inputs of size less than n 0 , and there is at least one if n 0 is sufûciently large. Consequently, T .n/ satisûes the ûrst property. If the second property fails to hold for T .n/, then the algorithm isn’t correct, because it would end up in an inûnite recursive loop or otherwise fail to compute a solution. Thus, it stands to reason that a recurrence for the worst-case running time of a correct divide-and-conquer algorithm would be algorithmic. Conventions for recurrences We adopt the following convention: Whenever a recurrence is stated without an explicit base case, we assume that the recurrence is algorithmic. That means you’re free to pick any sufûciently large threshold constant n 0 for the range of base cases where T .n/ D ‚.1/. Interestingly, the asymptotic solutions of most algorithmic recurrences you’re likely to see when analyzing algorithms don’t depend on the choice of threshold constant, as long as it’s large enough to make the recurrence well deûned. Asymptotic solutions of algorithmic divide-and-conquer recurrences also don’t tend to change when we drop any üoors or ceilings in a recurrence deûned on the integers to convert it to a recurrence deûned on the reals. Section 4.7 gives a suf- ûcient condition for ignoring üoors and ceilings that applies to most of the divide- and-conquer recurrences you’re likely to see. Consequently, we’ll frequently state algorithmic recurrences without üoors and ceilings. Doing so generally simpliûes the statement of the recurrences, as well as any math that we do with them. You may sometimes see recurrences that are not equations, but rather inequal- ities, such as T .n/ හ 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/. Because such a recurrence states only an upper bound on T .n/, we express its solution using O-notation rather than ‚-notation. Similarly, if the inequality is reversed to T .n/  2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/, then, because the recurrence gives only a lower bound on T .n/, we use �-notation in its solution. Divide-and-conquer and recurrences This chapter illustrates the divide-and-conquer method by presenting and using recurrences to analyze two divide-and-conquer algorithms for multiplying n  n matrices. Section 4.1 presents a simple divide-and-conquer algorithm that solves a matrix-multiplication problem of size n by breaking it into four subproblems of size n=2, which it then solves recursively. The running time of the algorithm can be characterized by the recurrence Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer 79 T .n/ D 8T .n=2/ C ‚.1/ ; which turns out to have the solution T .n/ D ‚.n 3 /. Although this divide-and- conquer algorithm is no faster than the straightforward method that uses a triply nested loop, it leads to an asymptotically faster divide-and-conquer algorithm due to V. Strassen, which we’ll explore in Section 4.2. Strassen’s remarkable algorithm divides a problem of size n into seven subproblems of size n=2 which it solves recursively. The running time of Strassen’s algorithm can be described by the recurrence T .n/ D 7T .n=2/ C ‚.n 2 / ; which has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg 7 / D O.n 2:81 /. Strassen’s algorithm beats the straightforward looping method asymptotically. These two divide-and-conquer algorithms both break a problem of size n into several subproblems of size n=2. Although it is common when using divide-and- conquer for all the subproblems to have the same size, that isn’t always the case. Sometimes it’s productive to divide a problem of size n into subproblems of differ- ent sizes, and then the recurrence describing the running time reüects the irregular- ity. For example, consider a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides a problem of size n into one subproblem of size n=3 and another of size 2n=3, taking ‚.n/ time to divide the problem and combine the solutions to the subproblems. Then the algorithm’s running time can be described by the recurrence T .n/ D T .n=3/ C T .2n=3/ C ‚.n/ ; which turns out to have solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. We’ll even see an algorithm in Chapter 9 that solves a problem of size n by recursively solving a subproblem of size n=5 and another of size 7n=10, taking ‚.n/ time for the divide and combine steps. Its performance satisûes the recurrence T .n/ D T .n=5/ C T .7n=10/ C ‚.n/ ; which has solution T .n/ D ‚.n/. Although divide-and-conquer algorithms usually create subproblems with sizes a constant fraction of the original problem size, that’s not always the case. For example, a recursive version of linear search (see Exercise 2.1-4) creates just one subproblem, with one element less than the original problem. Each recursive call takes constant time plus the time to recursively solve a subproblem with one less element, leading to the recurrence T .n/ D T .n  1/ C ‚.1/ ; which has solution T .n/ D ‚.n/. Nevertheless, the vast majority of efûcient divide-and-conquer algorithms solve subproblems that are a constant fraction of the size of the original problem, which is where we’ll focus our efforts. 80 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer Solving recurrences After learning about divide-and-conquer algorithms for matrix multiplication in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we’ll explore several mathematical tools for solving recur- rences4that is, for obtaining asymptotic ‚-, O-, or �-bounds on their solutions. We want simple-to-use tools that can handle the most commonly occurring situa- tions. But we also want general tools that work, perhaps with a little more effort, for less common cases. This chapter offers four methods for solving recurrences:  In the substitution method (Section 4.3), you guess the form of a bound and then use mathematical induction to prove your guess correct and solve for con- stants. This method is perhaps the most robust method for solving recurrences, but it also requires you to make a good guess and to produce an inductive proof.  The recursion-tree method (Section 4.4) models the recurrence as a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at various levels of the recursion. To solve the recurrence, you determine the costs at each level and add them up, perhaps using techniques for bounding summations from Section A.2. Even if you don’t use this method to formally prove a bound, it can be helpful in guessing the form of the bound for use in the substitution method.  The master method (Sections 4.5 and 4.6) is the easiest method, when it applies. It provides bounds for recurrences of the form T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ ; where a > 0 and b > 1 are constants and f .n/ is a given <driving= function. This type of recurrence tends to arise more frequently in the study of algorithms than any other. It characterizes a divide-and-conquer algorithm that creates a subproblems, each of which is 1=b times the size of the original problem, using f .n/ time for the divide and combine steps. To apply the master method, you need to memorize three cases, but once you do, you can easily determine asymptotic bounds on running times for many divide-and-conquer algorithms.  The Akra-Bazzi method (Section 4.7) is a general method for solving divide- and-conquer recurrences. Although it involves calculus, it can be used to attack more complicated recurrences than those addressed by the master method. 4.1 Multiplying square matrices We can use the divide-and-conquer method to multiply square matrices. If you’ve seen matrices before, then you probably know how to multiply them. (Otherwise, 4.1 Multiplying square matrices 81 you should read Section D.1.) Let A D .a i k / and B D .b jk / be square n  n matrices. The matrix product C D A  B is also an n  n matrix, where for i; j D 1; 2; : : : ; n, the .i; j / entry of C is given by c ij D n X kD1 a i k  b kj : (4.1) Generally, we’ll assume that the matrices are dense, meaning that most of the n 2 entries are not 0, as opposed to sparse, where most of the n 2 entries are 0 and the nonzero entries can be stored more compactly than in an n  n array. Computing the matrix C requires computing n 2 matrix entries, each of which is the sum of n pairwise products of input elements from A and B . The MATRIX- MULTIPLY procedure implements this strategy in a straightforward manner, and it generalizes the problem slightly. It takes as input three n  n matrices A, B , and C , and it adds the matrix product A  B to C , storing the result in C . Thus, it computes C D C C A  B , instead of just C D A  B . If only the product A  B is needed, just initialize all n 2 entries of C to 0 before calling the procedure, which takes an additional ‚.n 2 / time. We’ll see that the cost of matrix multiplication asymptotically dominates this initialization cost. MATRIX-MULTIPLY .A; B; C; n/ 1 for i D 1 to n // compute entries in each of n rows 2 for j D 1 to n // compute n entries in row i 3 for k D 1 to n 4 c ij D c ij C a i k  b kj // add in another term of equation (4.1) The pseudocode for MATRIX-MULTIPLY works as follows. The for loop of lines 134 computes the entries of each row i , and within a given row i , the for loop of lines 234 computes each of the entries c ij for each column j . Each iteration of the for loop of lines 334 adds in one more term of equation (4.1). Because each of the triply nested for loops runs for exactly n iterations, and each execution of line 4 takes constant time, the M ATRIX-MULTIPLY procedure operates in ‚.n 3 / time. Even if we add in the ‚.n 2 / time for initializing C to 0, the running time is still ‚.n 3 /. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm Let’s see how to compute the matrix product A  B using divide-and-conquer. For n > 1, the divide step partitions the n  n matrices into four n=2  n=2 submatrices. We’ll assume that n is an exact power of 2, so that as the algorithm recurses, we are guaranteed that the submatrix dimensions are integer. (Exercise 4.1-1 asks you 82 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer to relax this assumption.) As with MATRIX-MULTIPLY, we’ll actually compute C D C C A  B . But to simplify the math behind the algorithm, let’s assume that C has been initialized to the zero matrix, so that we are indeed computing C D A  B . The divide step views each of the n  n matrices A, B , and C as four n=2  n=2 submatrices: D Î A 11 A 12 A 21 A 22 Ï ; B D Î B 11 B 12 B 21 B 22 Ï ; C D Î C 11 C 12 C 21 C 22 Ï : (4.2) Then we can write the matrix product as C 11 C 12 C 21 C 22 Ï D Î A 11 A 12 A 21 A 22 ÏÎ B 11 B 12 B 21 B 22 Ï (4.3) D Î A 11  B 11 C A 12  B 21 A 11  B 12 C A 12  B 22 A 21  B 11 C A 22  B 21 A 21  B 12 C A 22  B 22 Ï ; (4.4) which corresponds to the equations 11 D A 11  B 11 C A 12  B 21 ; (4.5) C 12 D A 11  B 12 C A 12  B 22 ; (4.6) C 21 D A 21  B 11 C A 22  B 21 ; (4.7) C 22 D A 21  B 12 C A 22  B 22 : (4.8) Equations (4.5)3(4.8) involve eight n=2  n=2 multiplications and four additions of n=2  n=2 submatrices. As we look to transform these equations to an algorithm that can be described with pseudocode, or even implemented for real, there are two common approaches for implementing the matrix partitioning. One strategy is to allocate temporary storage to hold A’s four submatrices A 11 , A 12 , A 21 , and A 22 and B ’s four submatrices B 11 , B 12 , B 21 , and B 22 . Then copy each element in A and B to its corresponding location in the appropriate submatrix. After the recursive conquer step, copy the elements in each of C ’s four submatrices C 11 , C 12 , C 21 , and C 22 to their corresponding locations in C . This approach takes ‚.n 2 / time, since 3n 2 elements are copied. The second approach uses index calculations and is faster and more practical. A submatrix can be speciûed within a matrix by indicating where within the matrix the submatrix lies without touching any matrix elements. Partitioning a matrix (or recursively, a submatrix) only involves arithmetic on this location information, which has constant size independent of the size of the matrix. Changes to the submatrix elements update the original matrix, since they occupy the same storage. Going forward, we’ll assume that index calculations are used and that partition- ing can be performed in ‚.1/ time. Exercise 4.1-3 asks you to show that it makes no difference to the overall asymptotic running time of matrix multiplication, how- ever, whether the partitioning of matrices uses the ûrst method of copying or the 4.1 Multiplying square matrices 83 second method of index calculation. But for other divide-and-conquer matrix cal- culations, such as matrix addition, it can make a difference, as Exercise 4.1-4 asks you to show. The procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE uses equations (4.5)3(4.8) to implement a divide-and-conquer strategy for square-matrix multiplication. Like MATRIX-MULTIPLY, the procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE computes C D C C A  B since, if necessary, C can be initialized to 0 before the procedure is called in order to compute only C D A  B .

Let T .n/ be the worst-case time to multiply two n  n matrices using this procedure. In the base case, when n D 1, line 3 performs just the one scalar multiplica- tion and one addition, which means that T .1/ D ‚.1/. As is our convention for constant base cases, we can omit this base case in the statement of the recurrence. The recursive case occurs when n > 1. As discussed, we’ll use index calcula- tions to partition the matrices in line 6, taking ‚.1/ time. Lines 8315 recursively call MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE a total of eight times. The ûrst four recur- sive calls compute the ûrst terms of equations (4.5)3(4.8), and the subsequent four recursive calls compute and add in the second terms. Each recursive call adds the product of a submatrix of A and a submatrix of B to the appropriate submatrix 84 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer of C in place, thanks to index calculations. Because each recursive call multiplies two n=2  n=2 matrices, thereby contributing T .n=2/ to the overall running time, the time taken by all eight recursive calls is 8T .n=2/. There is no combine step, because the matrix C is updated in place. The total time for the recursive case, therefore, is the sum of the partitioning time and the time for all the recursive calls, or ‚.1/ C 8T .n=2/. Thus, omitting the statement of the base case, our recurrence for the running time of MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE is T .n/ D 8T .n=2/ C ‚.1/ : (4.9) As we’ll see from the master method in Section 4.5, recurrence (4.9) has the solu- tion T .n/ D ‚.n 3 /, which means that it has the same asymptotic running time as the straightforward MATRIX-MULTIPLY procedure. Why is the ‚.n 3 / solution to this recurrence so much larger than the ‚.n lg n/ solution to the merge-sort recurrence (2.3) on page 41? After all, the recurrence for merge sort contains a ‚.n/ term, whereas the recurrence for recursive matrix multiplication contains only a ‚.1/ term. Let’s think about what the recursion tree for recurrence (4.9) would look like as compared with the recursion tree for merge sort, illustrated in Figure 2.5 on page 43. The factor of 2 in the merge-sort recurrence determines how many chil- dren each tree node has, which in turn determines how many terms contribute to the sum at each level of the tree. In comparison, for the recurrence (4.9) for MATRIX- MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, each internal node in the recursion tree has eight children, not two, leading to a <bushier= recursion tree with many more leaves, despite the fact that the internal nodes are each much smaller. Consequently, the solution to recurrence (4.9) grows much more quickly than the solution to recurrence (2.3), which is borne out in the actual solutions: ‚.n 3 / versus ‚.n lg n/. Exercises Note: You may wish to read Section 4.5 before attempting some of these exercises. 4.1-1 Generalize MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE to multiply n  n matrices for which n is not necessarily an exact power of 2. Give a recurrence describing its running time. Argue that it runs in ‚.n 3 / time in the worst case. 4.1-2 How quickly can you multiply a k n  n matrix (k n rows and n columns) by an n  k n matrix, where k  1, using MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE as a subrou- tine? Answer the same question for multiplying an n  k n matrix by a k n  n matrix. Which is asymptotically faster, and by how much? 4.2 Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication 85 4.1-3 Suppose that instead of partitioning matrices by index calculation in M ATRIX- MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, you copy the appropriate elements of A, B , and C into separate n=2  n=2 submatrices A 11 , A 12 , A 21 , A 22 ; B 11 , B 12 , B 21 , B 22 ; and C 11 , C 12 , C 21 , C 22 , respectively. After the recursive calls, you copy the results from C 11 , C 12 , C 21 , and C 22 back into the appropriate places in C . How does recurrence (4.9) change, and what is its solution? 4.1-4 Write pseudocode for a divide-and-conquer algorithm M ATRIX-ADD-RECURSIVE that sums two n  n matrices A and B by partitioning each of them into four n=2  n=2 submatrices and then recursively summing corresponding pairs of sub- matrices. Assume that matrix partitioning uses ‚.1/-time index calculations. Write a recurrence for the worst-case running time of MATRIX-ADD-RECURSIVE, and solve your recurrence. What happens if you use ‚.n 2 /-time copying to imple- ment the partitioning instead of index calculations? 4.2 Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication You might ûnd it hard to imagine that any matrix multiplication algorithm could take less than ‚.n 3 / time, since the natural deûnition of matrix multiplication re- quires n 3 scalar multiplications. Indeed, many mathematicians presumed that it was not possible to multiply matrices in o.n 3 / time until 1969, when V. Strassen [424] published a remarkable recursive algorithm for multiplying n  n matrices. Strassen’s algorithm runs in ‚.n lg 7 / time. Since lg 7 D 2:8073549 : : : , Strassen’s algorithm runs in O.n 2:81 / time, which is asymptotically better than the ‚.n 3 / MATRIX-MULTIPLY and MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedures. The key to Strassen’s method is to use the divide-and-conquer idea from the MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure, but make the recursion tree less bushy. We’ll actually increase the work for each divide and combine step by a constant factor, but the reduction in bushiness will pay off. We won’t reduce the bushiness from the eight-way branching of recurrence (4.9) all the way down to the two-way branching of recurrence (2.3), but we’ll improve it just a little, and that will make a big difference. Instead of performing eight recursive multiplica- tions of n=2  n=2 matrices, Strassen’s algorithm performs only seven. The cost of eliminating one matrix multiplication is several new additions and subtractions of n=2  n=2 matrices, but still only a constant number. Rather than saying <addi- tions and subtractions= everywhere, we’ll adopt the common terminology of call- 86 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer ing them both <additions= because subtraction is structurally the same computation as addition, except for a change of sign. To get an inkling how the number of multiplications might be reduced, as well as why reducing the number of multiplications might be desirable for matrix calcu- lations, suppose that you have two numbers x and y , and you want to calculate the quantity x 2  y 2 . The straightforward calculation requires two multiplications to square x and y , followed by one subtraction (which you can think of as a <negative addition=). But let’s recall the old algebra trick x 2  y 2 D x 2  xy C xy  y 2 D x.x  y/ C y.x  y/ D .x C y/.x  y/. Using this formulation of the desired quantity, you could instead compute the sum x C y and the difference x  y and then multiply them, requiring only a single multiplication and two additions. At the cost of an extra addition, only one multiplication is needed to compute an ex- pression that looks as if it requires two. If x and y are scalars, there’s not much difference: both approaches require three scalar operations. If x and y are large matrices, however, the cost of multiplying outweighs the cost of adding, in which case the second method outperforms the ûrst, although not asymptotically. Strassen’s strategy for reducing the number of matrix multiplications at the ex- pense of more matrix additions is not at all obvious4perhaps the biggest under- statement in this book! As with MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, Strassen’s al- gorithm uses the divide-and-conquer method to compute C D C C A  B , where A, B , and C are all n  n matrices and n is an exact power of 2. Strassen’s algo- rithm computes the four submatrices C 11 , C 12 , C 21 , and C 22 of C from equations (4.5)3(4.8) on page 82 in four steps. We’ll analyze costs as we go along to develop a recurrence T .n/ for the overall running time. Let’s see how it works: 1. If n D 1, the matrices each contain a single element. Perform a single scalar multiplication and a single scalar addition, as in line 3 of MATRIX-MULTIPLY- RECURSIVE, taking ‚.1/ time, and return. Otherwise, partition the input ma- trices A and B and output matrix C into n=2  n=2 submatrices, as in equa- tion (4.2). This step takes ‚.1/ time by index calculation, just as in MATRIX- MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE. 2. Create n=2  n=2 matrices S 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S 10 , each of which is the sum or dif- ference of two submatrices from step 1. Create and zero the entries of seven n=2  n=2 matrices P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P 7 to hold seven n=2  n=2 matrix products. All 17 matrices can be created, and the P i initialized, in ‚.n 2 / time. 3. Using the submatrices from step 1 and the matrices S 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S 10 created in step 2, recursively compute each of the seven matrix products P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P 7 , taking 7T .n=2/ time. 4. Update the four submatrices C 11 ; C 12 ; C 21 ; C 22 of the result matrix C by adding or subtracting various P i matrices, which takes ‚.n 2 / time. 4.2 Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication 87 We’ll see the details of steps 234 in a moment, but we already have enough information to set up a recurrence for the running time of Strassen’s method. As is common, the base case in step 1 takes ‚.1/ time, which we’ll omit when stating the recurrence. When n > 1, steps 1, 2, and 4 take a total of ‚.n 2 / time, and step 3 requires seven multiplications of n=2  n=2 matrices. Hence, we obtain the following recurrence for the running time of Strassen’s algorithm: T .n/ D 7T .n=2/ C ‚.n 2 / : (4.10) Compared with MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, we have traded off one recur- sive submatrix multiplication for a constant number of submatrix additions. Once you understand recurrences and their solutions, you’ll be able to see why this trade- off actually leads to a lower asymptotic running time. By the master method in Sec- tion 4.5, recurrence (4.10) has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg 7 / D O.n 2:81 /, beating the ‚.n 3 /-time algorithms. Now, let’s delve into the details. Step 2 creates the following 10 matrices: S 1 D B 12  B 22 ; S 2 D A 11 C A 12 ; S 3 D A 21 C A 22 ; S 4 D B 21  B 11 ; S 5 D A 11 C A 22 ; S 6 D B 11 C B 22 ; S 7 D A 12  A 22 ; S 8 D B 21 C B 22 ; S 9 D A 11  A 21 ; S 10 D B 11 C B 12 : This step adds or subtracts n=2  n=2 matrices 10 times, taking ‚.n 2 / time. Step 3 recursively multiplies n=2  n=2 matrices 7 times to compute the follow- ing n=2  n=2 matrices, each of which is the sum or difference of products of A and B submatrices: P 1 D A 11  S 1 .D A 11  B 12  A 11  B 22 / ; P 2 D S 2  B 22 .D A 11  B 22 C A 12  B 22 / ; P 3 D S 3  B 11 .D A 21  B 11 C A 22  B 11 / ; P 4 D A 22  S 4 .D A 22  B 21  A 22  B 11 / ; P 5 D S 5  S 6 .D A 11  B 11 C A 11  B 22 C A 22  B 11 C A 22  B 22 / ; P 6 D S 7  S 8 .D A 12  B 21 C A 12  B 22  A 22  B 21  A 22  B 22 / ; P 7 D S 9  S 10 .D A 11  B 11 C A 11  B 12  A 21  B 11  A 21  B 12 / : 88 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer The only multiplications that the algorithm performs are those in the middle col- umn of these equations. The right-hand column just shows what these products equal in terms of the original submatrices created in step 1, but the terms are never explicitly calculated by the algorithm. Step 4 adds to and subtracts from the four n=2  n=2 submatrices of the prod- uct C the various P i matrices created in step 3. We start with C 11 D C 11 C P 5 C P 4  P 2 C P 6 : Expanding the calculation on the right-hand side, with the expansion of each P i on its own line and vertically aligning terms that cancel out, we see that the update to C 11 equals A 11  B 11 C A 11  B 22 C A 22  B 11 C A 22  B 22  A 22  B 11 C A 22  B 21  A 11  B 22  A 12  B 22  A 22  B 22  A 22  B 21 C A 12  B 22 C A 12  B 21 A 11  B 11 C A 12  B 21 ; which corresponds to equation (4.5). Similarly, setting C 12 D C 12 C P 1 C P 2 means that the update to C 12 equals A 11  B 12  A 11  B 22 C A 11  B 22 C A 12  B 22 A 11  B 12 C A 12  B 22 ; corresponding to equation (4.6). Setting C 21 D C 21 C P 3 C P 4 means that the update to C 21 equals A 21  B 11 C A 22  B 11  A 22  B 11 C A 22  B 21 A 21  B 11 C A 22  B 21 ; corresponding to equation (4.7). Finally, setting C 22 D C 22 C P 5 C P 1  P 3  P 7 means that the update to C 22 equals 4.2 Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication 89 A 11  B 11 C A 11  B 22 C A 22  B 11 C A 22  B 22  A 11  B 22 C A 11  B 12  A 22  B 11  A 21  B 11  A 11  B 11  A 11  B 12 C A 21  B 11 C A 21  B 12 A 22  B 22 C A 21  B 12 ; which corresponds to equation (4.8). Altogether, since we add or subtract n=2n=2 matrices 12 times in step 4, this step indeed takes ‚.n 2 / time. We can see that Strassen’s remarkable algorithm, comprising steps 134, pro- duces the correct matrix product using 7 submatrix multiplications and 18 subma- trix additions. We can also see that recurrence (4.10) characterizes its running time. Since Section 4.5 shows that this recurrence has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg 7 / D o.n 3 /, Strassen’s method asymptotically beats the ‚.n 3 / MATRIX-MULTIPLY and MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedures.

Show how to use that algorithm to multiply two different n  n matrices in ‚.n ˛ / time. 4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences Now that you have seen how recurrences characterize the running times of divide- and-conquer algorithms, let’s learn how to solve them. We start in this section with the substitution method, which is the most general of the four methods in this chapter. The substitution method comprises two steps: 1. Guess the form of the solution using symbolic constants. 2. Use mathematical induction to show that the solution works, and ûnd the con- stants. To apply the inductive hypothesis, you substitute the guessed solution for the func- tion on smaller values4hence the name <substitution method.= This method is powerful, but you must guess the form of the answer. Although generating a good guess might seem difûcult, a little practice can quickly improve your intuition. You can use the substitution method to establish either an upper or a lower bound on a recurrence. It’s usually best not to try to do both at the same time. That is, rather than trying to prove a ‚-bound directly, ûrst prove an O-bound, and then prove an �-bound. Together, they give you a ‚-bound (Theorem 3.1 on page 56). As an example of the substitution method, let’s determine an asymptotic upper bound on the recurrence: T .n/ D 2T .bn=2c/ C ‚.n/ : (4.11) This recurrence is similar to recurrence (2.3) on page 41 for merge sort, except for the üoor function, which ensures that T .n/ is deûned over the integers. Let’s guess that the asymptotic upper bound is the same4T .n/ D O.n lg n/4and use the substitution method to prove it. We’ll adopt the inductive hypothesis that T .n/ හ cn lg n for all n  n 0 , where we’ll choose the speciûc constants c > 0 and n 0 > 0 later, after we see what 4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences 91 constraints they need to obey. If we can establish this inductive hypothesis, we can conclude that T .n/ D O.n lg n/. It would be dangerous to use T .n/ D O.n lg n/ as the inductive hypothesis because the constants matter, as we’ll see in a moment in our discussion of pitfalls. Assume by induction that this bound holds for all numbers at least as big as n 0 and less than n. In particular, therefore, if n  2n 0 , it holds for bn=2c, yielding T .bn=2c/ හ c bn=2c lg.bn=2c/. Substituting into recurrence (4.11)4hence the name <substitution= method4yields T .n/ හ 2.c bn=2c lg.bn=2c// C ‚.n/ හ 2.c.n=2/ lg.n=2// C ‚.n/ D cn lg.n=2/ C ‚.n/ D cn lg n  cn lg 2 C ‚.n/ D cn lg n  cn C ‚.n/ හ cn lg n ; where the last step holds if we constrain the constants n 0 and c to be sufûciently large that for n  2n 0 , the quantity cn dominates the anonymous function hidden by the ‚.n/ term. We’ve shown that the inductive hypothesis holds for the inductive case, but we also need to prove that the inductive hypothesis holds for the base cases of the induction, that is, that T .n/ හ cn lg n when n 0 හ n < 2n 0 . As long as n 0 > 1 (a new constraint on n 0 ), we have lg n > 0, which implies that n lg n > 0. So let’s pick n 0 D 2. Since the base case of recurrence (4.11) is not stated explicitly, by our convention, T .n/ is algorithmic, which means that T .2/ and T .3/ are constant (as they should be if they describe the worst-case running time of any real program on inputs of size 2 or 3). Picking c D max fT .2/; T .3/g yields T .2/ හ c < .2 lg 2/c and T .3/ හ c < .3 lg 3/c , establishing the inductive hypothesis for the base cases. Thus, we have T .n/ හ cn lg n for all n  2, which implies that the solution to recurrence (4.11) is T .n/ D O.n lg n/. In the algorithms literature, people rarely carry out their substitution proofs to this level of detail, especially in their treatment of base cases. The reason is that for most algorithmic divide-and-conquer recurrences, the base cases are all handled in pretty much the same way. You ground the induction on a range of values from a convenient positive constant n 0 up to some constant n 0 0 > n 0 such that for n  n 0 0 , the recurrence always bottoms out in a constant-sized base case between n 0 and n 0 0 . (This example used n 0 0 D 2n 0 .) Then, it’s usually apparent, without spelling out the details, that with a suitably large choice of the leading constant (such as c for this example), the inductive hypothesis can be made to hold for all the values in the range from n 0 to n 0 0 . 92 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer Making a good guess Unfortunately, there is no general way to correctly guess the tightest asymptotic solution to an arbitrary recurrence. Making a good guess takes experience and, occasionally, creativity. Fortunately, learning some recurrence-solving heuristics, as well as playing around with recurrences to gain experience, can help you become a good guesser. You can also use recursion trees, which we’ll see in Section 4.4, to help generate good guesses. If a recurrence is similar to one you’ve seen before, then guessing a similar solution is reasonable. As an example, consider the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2 C 17/ C ‚.n/ ; deûned on the reals. This recurrence looks somewhat like the merge-sort recur- rence (2.3), but it’s more complicated because of the added <17= in the argument to T on the right-hand side. Intuitively, however, this additional term shouldn’t substantially affect the solution to the recurrence. When n is large, the relative difference between n=2 and n=2 C 17 is not that large: both cut n nearly in half. Consequently, it makes sense to guess that T .n/ D O.n lg n/, which you can verify is correct using the substitution method (see Exercise 4.3-1). Another way to make a good guess is to determine loose upper and lower bounds on the recurrence and then reduce your range of uncertainty. For example, you might start with a lower bound of T .n/ D �.n/ for recurrence (4.11), since the recurrence includes the term ‚.n/, and you can prove an initial upper bound of T .n/ D O.n 2 /. Then split your time between trying to lower the upper bound and trying to raise the lower bound until you converge on the correct, asymptotically tight solution, which in this case is T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. A trick of the trade: subtracting a low-order term Sometimes, you might correctly guess a tight asymptotic bound on the solution of a recurrence, but somehow the math fails to work out in the induction proof. The problem frequently turns out to be that the inductive assumption is not strong enough. The trick to resolving this problem is to revise your guess by subtracting a lower-order term when you hit such a snag. The math then often goes through. Consider the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.1/ (4.12) deûned on the reals. Let’s guess that the solution is T .n/ D O.n/ and try to show that T .n/ හ cn for n  n 0 , where we choose the constants c; n 0 > 0 suitably. Substituting our guess into the recurrence, we obtain T .n/ හ 2.c.n=2// C ‚.1/ D cn C ‚.1/ ; 4.3 The substitution method for solving recurrences 93 which, unfortunately, does not imply that T .n/ හ cn for any choice of c . We might be tempted to try a larger guess, say T .n/ D O.n 2 /. Although this larger guess works, it provides only a loose upper bound. It turns out that our original guess of T .n/ D O.n/ is correct and tight. In order to show that it is correct, however, we must strengthen our inductive hypothesis. Intuitively, our guess is nearly right: we are off only by ‚.1/, a lower-order term. Nevertheless, mathematical induction requires us to prove the exact form of the inductive hypothesis. Let’s try our trick of subtracting a lower-order term from our previous guess: T .n/ හ cn  d , where d  0 is a constant. We now have T .n/ හ 2.c.n=2/  d / C ‚.1/ D cn  2d C ‚.1/ හ cn  d  .d  ‚.1// හ cn  d as long as we choose d to be larger than the anonymous upper-bound constant hidden by the ‚-notation. Subtracting a lower-order term works! Of course, we must not forget to handle the base case, which is to choose the constant c large enough that cn  d dominates the implicit base cases. You might ûnd the idea of subtracting a lower-order term to be counterintuitive. After all, if the math doesn’t work out, shouldn’t you increase your guess? Not necessarily! When the recurrence contains more than one recursive invocation (recurrence (4.12) contains two), if you add a lower-order term to the guess, then you end up adding it once for each of the recursive invocations. Doing so takes you even further away from the inductive hypothesis. On the other hand, if you subtract a lower-order term from the guess, then you get to subtract it once for each of the recursive invocations. In the above example, we subtracted the constant d twice because the coefûcient of T .n=2/ is 2. We ended up with the inequality T .n/ හ cn  d  .d  ‚.1//, and we readily found a suitable value for d . Avoiding pitfalls Avoid using asymptotic notation in the inductive hypothesis for the substitution method because it’s error prone. For example, for recurrence (4.11), we can falsely <prove= that T .n/ D O.n/ if we unwisely adopt T .n/ D O.n/ as our inductive hypothesis: T .n/ හ 2  O.bn=2c/ C ‚.n/ D 2  O.n/ C ‚.n/ D O.n/ : Ń wrong! 94 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer The problem with this reasoning is that the constant hidden by the O-notation changes. We can expose the fallacy by repeating the <proof= using an explicit constant. For the inductive hypothesis, assume that T .n/ හ cn for all n  n 0 , where c; n 0 > 0 are constants. Repeating the ûrst two steps in the inequality chain yields T .n/ හ 2.c bn=2c/ C ‚.n/ හ cn C ‚.n/ : Now, indeed cnC‚.n/ D O.n/, but the constant hidden by the O-notation must be larger than c because the anonymous function hidden by the ‚.n/ is asymptotically positive. We cannot take the third step to conclude that cn C ‚.n/ හ cn, thus exposing the fallacy. When using the substitution method, or more generally mathematical induction, you must be careful that the constants hidden by any asymptotic notation are the same constants throughout the proof. Consequently, it’s best to avoid asymptotic notation in your inductive hypothesis and to name constants explicitly. Here’s another fallacious use of the substitution method to show that the solution to recurrence (4.11) is T .n/ D O.n/. We guess T .n/ හ cn and then argue T .n/ හ 2.c bn=2c/ C ‚.n/ හ cn C ‚.n/ D O.n/ ; Ń wrong! since c is a positive constant. The mistake stems from the difference between our goal4to prove that T .n/ D O.n/4and our inductive hypothesis4to prove that T .n/ හ cn. When using the substitution method, or in any inductive proof, you must prove the exact statement of the inductive hypothesis. In this case, we must explicitly prove that T .n/ හ cn to show that T .n/ D O.n/. Exercises 4.3-1 Use the substitution method to show that each of the following recurrences deûned on the reals has the asymptotic solution speciûed: a.

Then show how to subtract a lower-order term to make a substitution proof work. 4.3-3 The recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n  1/ C 1 has the solution T .n/ D O.2 n /. Show that a substitution proof fails with the assumption T .n/ හ c2 n , where c > 0 is constant. Then show how to subtract a lower-order term to make a substitution proof work. 4.4 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences Although you can use the substitution method to prove that a solution to a recur- rence is correct, you might have trouble coming up with a good guess. Drawing out a recursion tree, as we did in our analysis of the merge-sort recurrence in Sec- tion 2.3.2, can help. In a recursion tree, each node represents the cost of a single subproblem somewhere in the set of recursive function invocations. You typically sum the costs within each level of the tree to obtain the per-level costs, and then you sum all the per-level costs to determine the total cost of all levels of the recursion. Sometimes, however, adding up the total cost takes more creativity. A recursion tree is best used to generate intuition for a good guess, which you can then verify by the substitution method. If you are meticulous when drawing out a recursion tree and summing the costs, however, you can use a recursion tree as a direct proof of a solution to a recurrence. But if you use it only to generate a good guess, you can often tolerate a small amount of <sloppiness,= which can simplify the math. When you verify your guess with the substitution method later on, your math should be precise. This section demonstrates how you can use recursion trees to solve recurrences, generate good guesses, and gain intuition for recurrences. An illustrative example Let’s see how a recursion tree can provide a good guess for an upper-bound solution to the recurrence T .n/ D 3T .n=4/ C ‚.n 2 / : (4.13) Figure 4.1 shows how to derive the recursion tree for T .n/ D 3T .n=4/ C cn 2 , where the constant c > 0 is the upper-bound constant in the ‚.n 2 / term. Part (a) of the ûgure shows T .n/, which part (b) expands into an equivalent tree represent- ing the recurrence. The cn 2 term at the root represents the cost at the top level of recursion, and the three subtrees of the root represent the costs incurred by the 96 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer … … (d) (c) (b) (a) T .n/ cn 2 cn 2 cn 2 T  n 4 Í T  n 4 Í T  n 4 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í T  n 16 Í cn 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 4 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 c  n 16 Í 2 3 16 cn 2 Î 3 16 Ï 2 cn 2 log 4 n 3 log 4 n D n log 4 3 ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.n log 4 3 / Total: O.n 2 / Figure 4.1 Constructing a recursion tree for the recurrence T .n/ D 3T .n=4/ C cn 2 . Part (a) shows T .n/, which progressively expands in (b)–(d) to form the recursion tree. The fully expanded tree in (d) has height log 4 n. 4.4 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences 97 subproblems of size n=4. Part (c) shows this process carried one step further by expanding each node with cost T .n=4/ from part (b). The cost for each of the three children of the root is c.n=4/ 2 . We continue expanding each node in the tree by breaking it into its constituent parts as determined by the recurrence. Because subproblem sizes decrease by a factor of 4 every time we go down one level, the recursion must eventually bottom out in a base case where n < n 0 . By convention, the base case is T .n/ D ‚.1/ for n < n 0 , where n 0 > 0 is any threshold constant sufûciently large that the recurrence is well deûned. For the purpose of intuition, however, let’s simplify the math a little. Let’s assume that n is an exact power of 4 and that the base case is T .1/ D ‚.1/. As it turns out, these assumptions don’t affect the asymptotic solution. What’s the height of the recursion tree? The subproblem size for a node at depth i is n=4 i . As we descend the tree from the root, the subproblem size hits n D 1 when n=4 i D 1 or, equivalently, when i D log 4 n. Thus, the tree has internal nodes at depths 0; 1; 2; : : : ; log 4 n  1 and leaves at depth log 4 n. Part (d) of Figure 4.1 shows the cost at each level of the tree. Each level has three times as many nodes as the level above, and so the number of nodes at depth i is 3 i . Because subproblem sizes reduce by a factor of 4 for each level further from the root, each internal node at depth i D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; log 4 n  1 has a cost of c.n=4 i / 2 . Multiplying, we see that the total cost of all nodes at a given depth i is 3 i c.n=4 i / 2 D .3=16/ i cn 2 . The bottom level, at depth log 4 n, con- tains 3 log 4 n D n log 4 3 leaves (using equation (3.21) on page 66). Each leaf con- tributes ‚.1/, leading to a total leaf cost of ‚.n log 4 3 /. Now we add up the costs over all levels to determine the cost for the entire tree: T .n/ D cn 2 C 3 16 cn 2 C Î 3 16 Ï 2 cn 2 C    C Î 3 16 Ï log 4 n cn 2 C ‚.n log 4 3 / D log 4 n X i D0 Î 3 16 Ï i cn 2 C ‚.n log 4 3 / < 1 X i D0 Î 3 16 Ï i cn 2 C ‚.n log 4 3 / D 1 1  .3=16/ cn 2 C ‚.n log 4 3 / (by equation (A.7) on page 1142) D 16 13 cn 2 C ‚.n log 4 3 / D O.n 2 / (‚.n log 4 3 / D O.n 0:8 / D O.n 2 /) . We’ve derived the guess of T .n/ D O.n 2 / for the original recurrence. In this exam- ple, the coefûcients of cn 2 form a decreasing geometric series. By equation (A.7), the sum of these coefûcients is bounded from above by the constant 16=13. Since 98 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer the root’s contribution to the total cost is cn 2 , the cost of the root dominates the total cost of the tree. In fact, if O.n 2 / is indeed an upper bound for the recurrence (as we’ll verify in a moment), then it must be a tight bound. Why? The ûrst recursive call contributes a cost of ‚.n 2 /, and so �.n 2 / must be a lower bound for the recurrence. Let’s now use the substitution method to verify that our guess is correct, namely, that T .n/ D O.n 2 / is an upper bound for the recurrence T .n/ D 3T .n=4/C‚.n 2 /. We want to show that T .n/ හ d n 2 for some constant d > 0. Using the same constant c > 0 as before, we have T .n/ හ 3T .n=4/ C cn 2 හ 3d.n=4/ 2 C cn 2 D 3 16 d n 2 C cn 2 හ d n 2 ; where the last step holds if we choose d  .16=13/c . For the base case of the induction, let n 0 > 0 be a sufûciently large threshold constant that the recurrence is well deûned when T .n/ D ‚.1/ for n < n 0 . We can pick d large enough that d dominates the constant hidden by the ‚, in which case d n 2  d  T .n/ for 1 හ n < n 0 , completing the proof of the base case. The substitution proof we just saw involves two named constants, c and d . We named c and used it to stand for the upper-bound constant hidden and guaranteed to exist by the ‚-notation. We cannot pick c arbitrarily4it’s given to us4although, for any such c , any constant c 0  c also sufûces. We also named d , but we were free to choose any value for it that ût our needs. In this example, the value of d happened to depend on the value of c , which is ûne, since d is constant if c is constant. An irregular example Let’s ûnd an asymptotic upper bound for another, more irregular, example. Fig- ure 4.2 shows the recursion tree for the recurrence T .n/ D T .n=3/ C T .2n=3/ C ‚.n/ : (4.14) This recursion tree is unbalanced, with different root-to-leaf paths having different lengths. Going left at any node produces a subproblem of one-third the size, and going right produces a subproblem of two-thirds the size. Let n 0 > 0 be the implicit threshold constant such that T .n/ D ‚.1/ for 0 < n < n 0 , and let c represent the upper-bound constant hidden by the ‚.n/ term for n  n 0 . There are actually two n 0 constants here4one for the threshold in the recurrence, and the other for the threshold in the ‚-notation, so we’ll let n 0 be the larger of the two constants. 4.4 The recursion-tree method for solving recurrences 99 … … cn cn cn cn c  n 3 Í c Î 2n 3 Ï c  n 9 Í c Î 2n 9 Ï c Î 2n 9 Ï c Î 4n 9 Ï  log 3=2 .n=n 0 / Ú C 1 Total: O.n lg n/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.n/ Figure 4.2 A recursion tree for the recurrence T .n/ D T .n=3/ C T .2n=3/ C cn.

We hit the rightmost leaf when .2=3/ h n < n 0 හ .2=3/ h1 n, which happens when h D blog 3=2 .n=n 0 /c C 1 since, applying the üoor bounds in equation (3.2) on page 64 with x D log 3=2 .n=n 0 /, we have .2=3/ h n D .2=3/ bxcC1 n < .2=3/ x n D .n 0 =n/n D n 0 and .2=3/ h1 n D .2=3/ bxc n > .2=3/ x n D .n 0 =n/n D n 0 . Thus, the height of the tree is h D ‚.lg n/. We’re now in a position to understand the upper bound. Let’s postpone dealing with the leaves for a moment. Summing the costs of internal nodes across each level, we have at most cn per level times the ‚.lg n/ tree height for a total cost of O.n lg n/ for all internal nodes. It remains to deal with the leaves of the recursion tree, which represent base cases, each costing ‚.1/. How many leaves are there? It’s tempting to upper- bound their number by the number of leaves in a complete binary tree of height h D blog 3=2 .n=n 0 /c C 1, since the recursion tree is contained within such a com- plete binary tree. But this approach turns out to give us a poor bound. The complete binary tree has 1 node at the root, 2 nodes at depth 1, and gener- ally 2 k nodes at depth k. Since the height is h D blog 3=2 nc C 1, there are 100 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer 2 h D 2 blog 3=2 ncC1 හ 2n log 3=2 2 leaves in the complete binary tree, which is an upper bound on the number of leaves in the recursion tree. Because the cost of each leaf is ‚.1/, this analysis says that the total cost of all leaves in the recursion tree is O.n log 3=2 2 / D O.n 1:71 /, which is an asymptotically greater bound than the O.n lg n/ cost of all internal nodes. In fact, as we’re about to see, this bound is not tight. The cost of all leaves in the recursion tree is O.n/4asymptotically less than O.n lg n/. In other words, the cost of the internal nodes dominates the cost of the leaves, not vice versa. Rather than analyzing the leaves, we could quit right now and prove by substi- tution that T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. This approach works (see Exercise 4.4-3), but it’s instructive to understand how many leaves this recursion tree has. You may see recurrences for which the cost of leaves dominates the cost of internal nodes, and then you’ll be in better shape if you’ve had some experience analyzing the number of leaves. To ûgure out how many leaves there really are, let’s write a recurrence L.n/ for the number of leaves in the recursion tree for T .n/. Since all the leaves in T .n/ belong either to the left subtree or the right subtree of the root, we have L.n/ D ( 1 if n < n 0 ; L.n=3/ C L.2n=3/ if n  n 0 : (4.15) This recurrence is similar to recurrence (4.14), but it’s missing the ‚.n/ term, and it contains an explicit base case. Because this recurrence omits the ‚.n/ term, it is much easier to solve. Let’s apply the substitution method to show that it has solution L.n/ D O.n/. Using the inductive hypothesis L.n/ හ d n for some constant d > 0, and assuming that the inductive hypothesis holds for all values less than n, we have L.n/ D L.n=3/ C L.2n=3/ හ d n=3 C 2.d n/=3 හ d n ; which holds for any d > 0. We can now choose d large enough to handle the base case L.n/ D 1 for 0 < n < n 0 , for which d D 1 sufûces, thereby completing the substitution method for the upper bound on leaves. (Exercise 4.4-2 asks you to prove that L.n/ D ‚.n/.) Returning to recurrence (4.14) for T .n/, it now becomes apparent that the total cost of leaves over all levels must be L.n/  ‚.1/ D ‚.n/. Since we have derived the bound of O.n lg n/ on the cost of the internal nodes, it follows that the solution to recurrence (4.14) is T .n/ D O.n lg n/ C ‚.n/ D O.n lg n/. (Exercise 4.4-3 asks you to prove that T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/.) It’s wise to verify any bound obtained with a recursion tree by using the sub- stitution method, especially if you’ve made simplifying assumptions. But another 4.5 The master method for solving recurrences 101 strategy altogether is to use more-powerful mathematics, typically in the form of the master method in the next section (which unfortunately doesn’t apply to recur- rence (4.14)) or the Akra-Bazzi method (which does, but requires calculus). Even if you use a powerful method, a recursion tree can improve your intuition for what’s going on beneath the heavy math. Exercises 4.4-1 For each of the following recurrences, sketch its recursion tree, and guess a good asymptotic upper bound on its solution. Then use the substitution method to verify your answer. a.

We call f .n/ a driving function, and we call a recurrence of this general form a master recurrence. To use the master method, you need to memorize three cases, but then you’ll be able to solve many master recurrences quite easily. 102 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer A master recurrence describes the running time of a divide-and-conquer algo- rithm that divides a problem of size n into a subproblems, each of size n=b < n . The algorithm solves the a subproblems recursively, each in T .n=b/ time. The driving function f .n/ encompasses the cost of dividing the problem before the re- cursion, as well as the cost of combining the results of the recursive solutions to subproblems. For example, the recurrence arising from Strassen’s algorithm is a master recurrence with a D 7, b D 2, and driving function f .n/ D ‚.n 2 /. As we have mentioned, in solving a recurrence that describes the running time of an algorithm, one technicality that we’d often prefer to ignore is the requirement that the input size n be an integer. For example, we saw that the running time of merge sort can be described by recurrence (2.3), T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/, on page 41. But if n is an odd number, we really don’t have two problems of exactly half the size. Rather, to ensure that the problem sizes are integers, we round one subproblem down to size bn=2c and the other up to size dn=2e, so the true recurrence is T .n/ D T .dn=2e C T .bn=2c/ C ‚.n/. But this üoors-and-ceilings recurrence is longer to write and messier to deal with than recurrence (2.3), which is deûned on the reals. We’d rather not worry about üoors and ceilings, if we don’t have to, especially since the two recurrences have the same ‚.n lg n/ solution. The master method allows you to state a master recurrence without üoors and ceilings and implicitly infer them. No matter how the arguments are rounded up or down to the nearest integer, the asymptotic bounds that it provides remain the same. Moreover, as we’ll see in Section 4.6, if you deûne your master recurrence on the reals, without implicit üoors and ceilings, the asymptotic bounds still don’t change. Thus you can ignore üoors and ceilings for master recurrences. Section 4.7 gives sufûcient conditions for ignoring üoors and ceilings in more general divide- and-conquer recurrences. The master theorem The master method depends upon the following theorem. Theorem 4.1 (Master theorem) Let a > 0 and b > 1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a driving function that is deûned and nonnegative on all sufûciently large reals. Deûne the recurrence T .n/ on n 2 N by T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ ; (4.17) where aT .n=b/ actually means a 0 T .bn=bc/ C a 00 T .dn=be/ for some constants a 0  0 and a 00  0 satisfying a D a 0 C a 00 . Then the asymptotic behavior of T .n/ can be characterized as follows: 4.5 The master method for solving recurrences 103 1. If there exists a constant � > 0 such that f .n/ D O.n log b a /, then T .n/ D ‚.n log b a /. 2. If there exists a constant k  0 such that f .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg k n/, then T .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/. 3. If there exists a constant � > 0 such that f .n/ D �.n log b aC /, and if f .n/ addi- tionally satisûes the regularity condition af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ for some constant c < 1 and all sufûciently large n, then T .n/ D ‚.f .n//. Before applying the master theorem to some examples, let’s spend a few mo- ments to understand broadly what it says. The function n log b a is called the water- shed function. In each of the three cases, we compare the driving function f .n/ to the watershed function n log b a . Intuitively, if the watershed function grows asymp- totically faster than the driving function, then case 1 applies. Case 2 applies if the two functions grow at nearly the same asymptotic rate. Case 3 is the <opposite= of case 1, where the driving function grows asymptotically faster than the watershed function. But the technical details matter. In case 1, not only must the watershed function grow asymptotically faster than the driving function, it must grow polynomially faster. That is, the watershed func- tion n log b a must be asymptotically larger than the driving function f .n/ by at least a factor of ‚.n  / for some constant � > 0. The master theorem then says that the solution is T .n/ D ‚.n log b a /. In this case, if we look at the recursion tree for the recurrence, the cost per level grows at least geometrically from root to leaves, and the total cost of leaves dominates the total cost of the internal nodes. In case 2, the watershed and driving functions grow at nearly the same asymp- totic rate. But more speciûcally, the driving function grows faster than the wa- tershed function by a factor of ‚.lg k n/, where k  0. The master theorem says that we tack on an extra lg n factor to f .n/, yielding the solution T .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/. In this case, each level of the recursion tree costs approxi- mately the same4‚.n log b a lg k n/4and there are ‚.lg n/ levels. In practice, the most common situation for case 2 occurs when k D 0, in which case the water- shed and driving functions have the same asymptotic growth, and the solution is T .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg n/. Case 3 mirrors case 1. Not only must the driving function grow asymptotically faster than the watershed function, it must grow polynomially faster. That is, the driving function f .n/ must be asymptotically larger than the watershed function n log b a by at least a factor of ‚.n  / for some constant � > 0. Moreover, the driving function must satisfy the regularity condition that af .n=b/ හ cf .n/. This condi- tion is satisûed by most of the polynomially bounded functions that you’re likely to encounter when applying case 3. The regularity condition might not be satisûed 104 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer if the driving function grows slowly in local areas, yet relatively quickly overall. (Exercise 4.5-5 gives an example of such a function.) For case 3, the master theo- rem says that the solution is T .n/ D ‚.f .n//. If we look at the recursion tree, the cost per level drops at least geometrically from the root to the leaves, and the root cost dominates the cost of all other nodes. It’s worth looking again at the requirement that there be polynomial separation between the watershed function and the driving function for either case 1 or case 3 to apply. The separation doesn’t need to be much, but it must be there, and it must grow polynomially. For example, for the recurrence T .n/ D 4T .n=2/ C n 1:99 (admittedly not a recurrence you’re likely to see when analyzing an algorithm), the watershed function is n log b a D n 2 . Hence the driving function f .n/ D n 1:99 is polynomially smaller by a factor of n 0:01 . Thus case 1 applies with � D 0:01. Using the master method To use the master method, you determine which case (if any) of the master theorem applies and write down the answer. As a ûrst example, consider the recurrence T .n/ D 9T .n=3/ C n. For this recurrence, we have a D 9 and b D 3, which implies that n log b a D n log 3 9 D ‚.n 2 ). Since f .n/ D n D O.n 2 / for any constant � හ 1, we can apply case 1 of the master theorem to conclude that the solution is T .n/ D ‚.n 2 /. Now consider the recurrence T .n/ D T .2n=3/ C 1, which has a D 1 and b D 3=2, which means that the watershed function is n log b a D n log 3=2 1 D n 0 D 1. Case 2 applies since f .n/ D 1 D ‚.n log b a lg 0 n/ D ‚.1/. The solution to the recurrence is T .n/ D ‚.lg n/. For the recurrence T .n/ D 3T .n=4/ C n lg n, we have a D 3 and b D 4, which means that n log b a D n log 4 3 D O.n 0:793 /. Since f .n/ D n lg n D �.n log 4 3C /, where � can be as large as approximately 0:2, case 3 applies as long as the regularity condition holds for f .n/. It does, because for sufûciently large n, we have that af .n=b/ D 3.n=4/ lg.n=4/ හ .3=4/n lg n D cf .n/ for c D 3=4. By case 3, the solution to the recurrence is T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. Next, let’s look at the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C n lg n, where we have a D 2, b D 2, and n log b a D n log 2 2 D n. Case 2 applies since f .n/ D n lg n D ‚.n log b a lg 1 n/. We conclude that the solution is T .n/ D ‚.n lg 2 n/. We can use the master method to solve the recurrences we saw in Sections 2.3.2, 4.1, and 4.2. Recurrence (2.3), T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/, on page 41, characterizes the run- ning time of merge sort. Since a D 2 and b D 2, the watershed function is n log b a D n log 2 2 D n. Case 2 applies because f .n/ D ‚.n/, and the solution is T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. 4.5 The master method for solving recurrences 105 Recurrence (4.9), T .n/ D 8T .n=2/ C ‚.1/, on page 84, describes the running time of the simple recursive algorithm for matrix multiplication. We have a D 8 and b D 2, which means that the watershed function is n log b a D n log 2 8 D n 3 . Since n 3 is polynomially larger than the driving function f .n/ D ‚.1/4indeed, we have f .n/ D O.n 3 / for any positive � < 34case 1 applies. We conclude that T .n/ D ‚.n 3 /. Finally, recurrence (4.10), T .n/ D 7T .n=2/ C ‚.n 2 /, on page 87, arose from the analysis of Strassen’s algorithm for matrix multiplication. For this recurrence, we have a D 7 and b D 2, and the watershed function is n log b a D n lg 7 . Observing that lg 7 D 2:807355 : : :, we can let � D 0:8 and bound the driving function f .n/ D ‚.n 2 / D O.n lg 7 /. Case 1 applies with solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg 7 /. When the master method doesn’t apply There are situations where you can’t use the master theorem. For example, it can be that the watershed function and the driving function cannot be asymptotically compared. We might have that f .n/  n log b a for an inûnite number of values of n but also that f .n/  n log b a for an inûnite number of different values of n. As a practical matter, however, most of the driving functions that arise in the study of algorithms can be meaningfully compared with the watershed function. If you encounter a master recurrence for which that’s not the case, you’ll have to resort to substitution or other methods. Even when the relative growths of the driving and watershed functions can be compared, the master theorem does not cover all the possibilities. There is a gap between cases 1 and 2 when f .n/ D o.n log b a /, yet the watershed function does not grow polynomially faster than the driving function. Similarly, there is a gap between cases 2 and 3 when f .n/ D !.n log b a / and the driving function grows more than polylogarithmically faster than the watershed function, but it does not grow polynomially faster. If the driving function falls into one of these gaps, or if the regularity condition in case 3 fails to hold, you’ll need to use something other than the master method to solve the recurrence. As an example of a driving function falling into a gap, consider the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C n= lg n. Since a D 2 and b D 2, the watershed function is n log b a D n log 2 2 D n 1 D n. The driving function is n= lg n D o.n/, which means that it grows asymptotically more slowly than the watershed function n. But n= lg n grows only logarithmically slower than n, not polynomially slower. More precisely, equation (3.24) on page 67 says that lg n D o.n  / for any constant � > 0, which means that 1= lg n D !.n  / and n= lg n D !.n 1 / D !.n log b a /. Thus no constant � > 0 exists such that n= lg n D O.n log b a /, which is required for case 1 to apply. Case 2 fails to apply as well, since n= lg n D ‚.n log b a lg k n/, where k D 1, but k must be nonnegative for case 2 to apply. 106 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer To solve this kind of recurrence, you must use another method, such as the sub- stitution method (Section 4.3) or the Akra-Bazzi method (Section 4.7). (Exer- cise 4.6-3 asks you to show that the answer is ‚.n lg lg n/.) Although the master theorem doesn’t handle this particular recurrence, it does handle the overwhelming majority of recurrences that tend to arise in practice. Exercises 4.5-1 Use the master method to give tight asymptotic bounds for the following recur- rences. a. T .n/ D 2T .n=4/ C 1. b. T .n/ D 2T .n=4/ C p n. c. T .n/ D 2T .n=4/ C p n lg 2 n. d.

His algorithm will use the divide-and- conquer method, dividing each matrix into n=4  n=4 submatrices, and the divide and combine steps together will take ‚.n 2 / time. Suppose that the professor’s al- gorithm creates a recursive subproblems of size n=4. What is the largest integer value of a for which his algorithm could possibly run asymptotically faster than Strassen’s? 4.5-3 Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence T .n/ D T .n=2/ C ‚.1/ is T .n/ D ‚.lg n/. (See Exercise 2.3-6 for a description of binary search.) 4.5-4 Consider the function f .n/ D lg n. Argue that although f .n=2/ < f .n/ , the regularity condition af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ with a D 1 and b D 2 does not hold for any constant c < 1. Argue further that for any � > 0, the condition in case 3 that f .n/ D �.n log b aC / does not hold. 4.6 Proof of the continuous master theorem 107 4.5-5 Show that for suitable constants a, b, and � , the function f .n/ D 2 dlg ne satisûes all the conditions in case 3 of the master theorem except the regularity condition. ? 4.6 Proof of the continuous master theorem Proving the master theorem (Theorem 4.1) in its full generality, especially dealing with the knotty technical issue of üoors and ceilings, is beyond the scope of this book. This section, however, states and proves a variant of the master theorem, called the continuous master theorem 1 in which the master recurrence (4.17) is deûned over sufûciently large positive real numbers. The proof of this version, uncomplicated by üoors and ceilings, contains the main ideas needed to understand how master recurrences behave. Section 4.7 discusses üoors and ceilings in divide- and-conquer recurrences at greater length, presenting sufûcient conditions for them not to affect the asymptotic solutions. Of course, since you need not understand the proof of the master theorem in order to apply the master method, you may choose to skip this section. But if you wish to study more-advanced algorithms beyond the scope of this textbook, you may appreciate a better understanding of the underlying mathematics, which the proof of the continuous master theorem provides. Although we usually assume that recurrences are algorithmic and don’t require an explicit statement of a base case, we must be much more careful for proofs that justify the practice. The lemmas and theorem in this section explicitly state the base cases, because the inductive proofs require mathematical grounding. It is common in the world of mathematics to be extraordinarily careful proving theorems that justify acting more casually in practice. The proof of the continuous master theorem involves two lemmas. Lemma 4.2 uses a slightly simpliûed master recurrence with a threshold constant of n 0 D 1, rather than the more general n 0 > 0 threshold constant implied by the unstated base case. The lemma employs a recursion tree to reduce the solution of the simpliûed master recurrence to that of evaluating a summation. Lemma 4.3 then provides asymptotic bounds for the summation, mirroring the three cases of the master the- orem. Finally, the continuous master theorem itself (Theorem 4.4) gives asymp- totic bounds for master recurrences, while generalizing to an arbitrary threshold constant n 0 > 0 as implied by the unstated base case. 1 This terminology does not mean that either T .n/ or f .n/ need be continuous, only that the domain of T .n/ is the real numbers, as opposed to integers. 108 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer Some of the proofs use the properties described in Problem 3-5 on pages 72373 to combine and simplify complicated asymptotic expressions. Although Prob- lem 3-5 addresses only ‚-notation, the properties enumerated there can be ex- tended to O-notation and �-notation as well. Here’s the ûrst lemma. Lemma 4.2 Let a > 0 and b > 1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a function deûned over real numbers n  1. Then the recurrence T .n/ D ( ‚.1/ if 0 හ n < 1 ; aT .n=b/ C f .n/ if n  1 has solution T .n/ D ‚.n log b a / C blog b nc X j D0 a j f .n=b j / : (4.18) Proof Consider the recursion tree in Figure 4.3. Let’s look ûrst at its inter- nal nodes. The root of the tree has cost f .n/, and it has a children, each with cost f .n=b/. (It is convenient to think of a as being an integer, especially when vi- sualizing the recursion tree, but the mathematics does not require it.) Each of these children has a children, making a 2 nodes at depth 2, and each of the a children has cost f .n=b 2 /. In general, there are a j nodes at depth j , and each node has cost f .n=b j /. Now, let’s move on to understanding the leaves. The tree grows downward un- til n=b j becomes less than 1. Thus, the tree has height blog b nc C 1, because n=b blog b nc  n=b log b n D 1 and n=b blog b ncC1 < n=b log b n D 1. Since, as we have observed, the number of nodes at depth j is a j and all the leaves are at depth blog b nc C 1, the tree contains a blog b ncC1 leaves. Using the identity (3.21) on page 66, we have a blog b ncC1 හ a log b nC1 D an log b a D O.n log b a /, since a is constant, and a blog b ncC1  a log b n D n log b a D �.n log b a /. Consequently, the total number of leaves is ‚.n log b a /4asymptotically, the watershed function. We are now in a position to derive equation (4.18) by summing the costs of the nodes at each depth in the tree, as shown in the ûgure. The ûrst term in the equation is the total costs of the leaves. Since each leaf is at depth blog b nc C 1 and n=b blog b ncC1 < 1, the base case of the recurrence gives the cost of a leaf: T .n=b blog b ncC1 / D ‚.1/. Hence the cost of all ‚.n log b a / leaves is ‚.n log b a /  ‚.1/ D ‚.n log b a / by Problem 3-5(d). The second term in equa- tion (4.18) is the cost of the internal nodes, which, in the underlying divide-and- conquer algorithm, represents the costs of dividing problems into subproblems and 4.6 Proof of the continuous master theorem 109 … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … f .n/ f .n/ a a a a a a a a a a a a a f .n=b/ f .n=b/ f .n=b/ f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / f .n=b 2 / af .n=b/ a 2 f .n=b 2 / blog b nc C 1 a blog b ncC1 ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.1/ ‚.n log b a / Total: ‚.n log b a / C blog b nc X j D0 a j f .n=b j / Figure 4.3 The recursion tree generated by T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/.

The cost of the nodes at each depth is shown at the right, and their sum is given in equation (4.18). then recombining the subproblems. Since the cost for all the internal nodes at depth j is a j f .n=b j /, the total cost of all internal nodes is blog b nc X j D0 a j f .n=b j / : As we’ll see, the three cases of the master theorem depend on the distribution of the total cost across levels of the recursion tree: Case 1: The costs increase geometrically from the root to the leaves, growing by a constant factor with each level. Case 2: The costs depend on the value of k in the theorem. With k D 0, the costs are equal for each level; with k D 1, the costs grow linearly from the root to the leaves; with k D 2, the growth is quadratic; and in general, the costs grow polynomially in k. Case 3: The costs decrease geometrically from the root to the leaves, shrinking by a constant factor with each level. 110 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer The summation in equation (4.18) describes the cost of the dividing and com- bining steps in the underlying divide-and-conquer algorithm. The next lemma pro- vides asymptotic bounds on the summation’s growth. Lemma 4.3 Let a > 0 and b > 1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a function deûned over real numbers n  1. Then the asymptotic behavior of the function g.n/ D blog b nc X j D0 a j f .n=b j / ; (4.19) deûned for n  1, can be characterized as follows: 1. If there exists a constant � > 0 such that f .n/ D O.n log b a /, then g.n/ D O.n log b a /. 2. If there exists a constant k  0 such that f .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg k n/, then g.n/ D ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/. 3. If there exists a constant c in the range 0 < c < 1 such that 0 < af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ for all n  1, then g.n/ D ‚.f .n//. Proof For case 1, we have f .n/ D O.n log b a /, which implies that f .n=b j / D O..n=b j / log b a /.

Exercise 4.6-1 asks you to show that the summation can similarly be bounded from below by �.log kC1 b n/. Since we have tight upper and lower bounds, the summa- tion is ‚.log kC1 b n/, from which we can conclude that g.n/ D ‚ ã n log b a log kC1 b n ä , thereby completing the proof of case 2. 112 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer For case 3, observe that f .n/ appears in the deûnition (4.19) of g.n/ (when j D 0) and that all terms of g.n/ are positive. Therefore, we must have g.n/ D �.f .n// , and it only remains to prove that g.n/ D O.f .n//. Performing j itera- tions of the inequality af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ yields a j f .n=b j / හ c j f .n/.

With case 3 proved, the entire proof of the lemma is complete. We can now state and prove the continuous master theorem. Theorem 4.4 (Continuous master theorem) Let a > 0 and b > 1 be constants, and let f .n/ be a driving function that is deûned and nonnegative on all sufûciently large reals. Deûne the algorithmic recurrence T .n/ on the positive real numbers by T .n/ D aT .n=b/ C f .n/ : Then the asymptotic behavior of T .n/ can be characterized as follows: 1. If there exists a constant � > 0 such that f .n/ D O.n log b a /, then T .n/ D ‚.n log b a /. 2. If there exists a constant k  0 such that f .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg k n/, then T .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/. 3. If there exists a constant � > 0 such that f .n/ D �.n log b aC /, and if f .n/ ad- ditionally satisûes the regularity condition af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ for some constant c < 1 and all sufûciently large n, then T .n/ D ‚.f .n//. Proof The idea is to bound the summation (4.18) from Lemma 4.2 by applying Lemma 4.3. But we must account for Lemma 4.2 using a base case for 0 < n < 1, 4.6 Proof of the continuous master theorem 113 whereas this theorem uses an implicit base case for 0 < n < n 0 , where n 0 > 0 is an arbitrary threshold constant. Since the recurrence is algorithmic, we can assume that f .n/ is deûned for n  n 0 . For n > 0, let us deûne two auxiliary functions T 0 .n/ D T .n 0 n/ and f 0 .n/ D f .n 0 n/. We have T 0 .n/ D T .n 0 n/ D ( ‚.1/ if n 0 n < n 0 ; aT .n 0 n=b/ C f .n 0 n/ if n 0 n  n 0 D ( ‚.1/ if n < 1 ; aT 0 .n=b/ C f 0 .n/ if n  1 : (4.20) We have obtained a recurrence for T 0 .n/ that satisûes the conditions of Lemma 4.2, and by that lemma, the solution is 0 .n/ D ‚.n log b a / C blog b nc X j D0 a j f 0 .n=b j / : (4.21) To solve T 0 .n/, we ûrst need to bound f 0 .n/. Let’s examine the individual cases in the theorem. The condition for case 1 is f .n/ D O.n log b a / for some constant � > 0. We have 0 .n/ D f .n 0 n/ D O..n 0 n/ log b a / D O.n log b a / ; since a, b, n 0 , and � are all constant. The function f 0 .n/ satisûes the conditions of case 1 of Lemma 4.3, and the summation in equation (4.18) of Lemma 4.2 evaluates to O.n log b a /. Because a, b and n 0 are all constants, we have T .n/ D T 0 .n=n 0 / D ‚..n=n 0 / log b a / C O..n=n 0 / log b a / D ‚.n log b a / C O.n log b a / D ‚.n log b a / (by Problem 3-5(b)) , thereby completing case 1 of the theorem. The condition for case 2 is f .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg k n/ for some constant k  0. We have 0 .n/ D f .n 0 n/ D ‚..n 0 n/ log b a lg k .n 0 n// D ‚.n log b a lg k n/ (by eliminating the constant terms) . 114 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer Similar to the proof of case 1, the function f 0 .n/ satisûes the conditions of case 2 of Lemma 4.3. The summation in equation (4.18) of Lemma 4.2 is therefore ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/, which implies that T .n/ D T 0 .n=n 0 / D ‚..n=n 0 / log b a / C ‚..n=n 0 / log b a lg kC1 .n=n 0 // D ‚.n log b a / C ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/ D ‚.n log b a lg kC1 n/ (by Problem 3-5(c)) , which proves case 2 of the theorem. Finally, the condition for case 3 is f .n/ D �.n log b aC / for some constant � > 0 and f .n/ additionally satisûes the regularity condition af .n=b/ හ cf .n/ for all n  n 0 and some constants c < 1 and n 0 > 1. The ûrst part of case 3 is like case 1: f 0 .n/ D f .n 0 n/ D �..n 0 n/ log b aC / D �.n log b aC / : Using the deûnition of f 0 .n/ and the fact that n 0 n  n 0 for all n  1, we have for n  1 that af 0 .n=b/ D af .n 0 n=b/ හ cf .n 0 n/ D cf 0 .n/ : Thus f 0 .n/ satisûes the requirements for case 3 of Lemma 4.3, and the summation in equation (4.18) of Lemma 4.2 evaluates to ‚.f 0 .n//, yielding T .n/ D T 0 .n=n 0 / D ‚..n=n 0 / log b a / C ‚.f 0 .n=n 0 // D ‚.f 0 .n=n 0 // D ‚.f .n// ; which completes the proof of case 3 of the theorem and thus the whole theorem.

Conclude that a master recurrence T .n/ using f .n/ as its driving function has solution T .n/ D ‚.n log b a lg lg n/. ? 4.7 Akra-Bazzi recurrences This section provides an overview of two advanced topics related to divide-and- conquer recurrences. The ûrst deals with technicalities arising from the use of üoors and ceilings, and the second discusses the Akra-Bazzi method, which in- volves a little calculus, for solving complicated divide-and-conquer recurrences. In particular, we’ll look at the class of algorithmic divide-and-conquer recur- rences originally studied by M. Akra and L. Bazzi [13]. These Akra-Bazzi recur- rences take the form T .n/ D f .n/ C k X i D1 a i T .n=b i / ; (4.22) where k is a positive integer; all the constants a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k 2 R are strictly posi- tive; all the constants b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k 2 R are strictly greater than 1; and the driving function f .n/ is deûned on sufûciently large nonnegative reals and is itself non- negative. Akra-Bazzi recurrences generalize the class of recurrences addressed by the master theorem. Whereas master recurrences characterize the running times of divide-and-conquer algorithms that break a problem into equal-sized subproblems (modulo üoors and ceilings), Akra-Bazzi recurrences can describe the running time of divide-and-conquer algorithms that break a problem into different-sized sub- problems. The master theorem, however, allows you to ignore üoors and ceilings, but the Akra-Bazzi method for solving Akra-Bazzi recurrences needs an additional requirement to deal with üoors and ceilings. But before diving into the Akra-Bazzi method itself, let’s understand the lim- itations involved in ignoring üoors and ceilings in Akra-Bazzi recurrences. As you’re aware, algorithms generally deal with integer-sized inputs. The mathemat- ics for recurrences is often easier with real numbers, however, than with integers, where we must cope with üoors and ceilings to ensure that terms are well deûned. The difference may not seem to be much4especially because that’s often the truth with recurrences4but to be mathematically correct, we must be careful with our 116 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer assumptions. Since our end goal is to understand algorithms and not the vagaries of mathematical corner cases, we’d like to be casual yet rigorous. How can we treat üoors and ceilings casually while still ensuring rigor? From a mathematical point of view, the difûculty in dealing with üoors and ceilings is that some driving functions can be really, really weird. So it’s not okay in general to ignore üoors and ceilings in Akra-Bazzi recurrences. Fortunately, most of the driving functions we encounter in the study of algorithms behave nicely, and üoors and ceilings don’t make a difference. The polynomial-growth condition If the driving function f .n/ in equation (4.22) is well behaved in the following sense, it’s okay to drop üoors and ceilings. A function f .n/ deûned on all sufûciently large positive reals satisûes the polynomial-growth condition if there exists a constant y n > 0 such that the following holds: for every constant �  1, there exists a constant d > 1 (depending on �) such that f .n/=d හ f . n/ හ df .n/ for all 1 හ  හ � and n  y n. This deûnition may be one of the hardest in this textbook to get your head around. To a ûrst order, it says that f .n/ satisûes the property that f .‚.n// D ‚.f .n//, although the polynomial-growth condition is actually somewhat stronger (see Ex- ercise 4.7-4). The deûnition also implies that f .n/ is asymptotically positive (see Exercise 4.7-3). Examples of functions that satisfy the polynomial-growth condition include any function of the form f .n/ D ‚.n ˛ lg ˇ n lg lg  n/, where ˛, ˇ, and � are constants. Most of the polynomially bounded functions used in this book satisfy the condition. Exponentials and superexponentials do not (see Exercise 4.7-2, for example), and there also exist polynomially bounded functions that do not. Floors and ceilings in <nice= recurrences When the driving function in an Akra-Bazzi recurrence satisûes the polynomial- growth condition, üoors and ceilings don’t change the asymptotic behavior of the solution. The following theorem, which is presented without proof, formalizes this notion. Theorem 4.5 Let T .n/ be a function deûned on the nonnegative reals that satisûes recur- rence (4.22), where f .n/ satisûes the polynomial-growth condition. Let T 0 .n/ be another function deûned on the natural numbers also satisfying recurrence (4.22), 4.7 Akra-Bazzi recurrences 117 except that each T .n=b i / is replaced either with T .dn=b i e/ or with T .bn=b i c/. Then we have T 0 .n/ D ‚.T .n//. Floors and ceilings represent a minor perturbation to the arguments in the re- cursion. By inequality (3.2) on page 64, they perturb an argument by at most 1. But much larger perturbations are tolerable. As long as the driving function f .n/ in recurrence (4.22) satisûes the polynomial-growth condition, it turns out that re- placing any term T .n=b i / with T .n=b i C h i .n//, where jh i .n/j D O.n= lg 1C n/ for some constant � > 0 and sufûciently large n, leaves the asymptotic solution unaffected. Thus, the divide step in a divide-and-conquer algorithm can be moder- ately coarse without affecting the solution to its running-time recurrence. The Akra-Bazzi method The Akra-Bazzi method, not surprisingly, was developed to solve Akra-Bazzi re- currences (4.22), which by dint of Theorem 4.5, applies in the presence of üoors and ceilings or even larger perturbations, as just discussed. The method involves ûrst determining the unique real number p such that P k i D1 a i =b p i D 1. Such a p always exists, because when p ! 1, the sum goes to 1; it decreases as p in- creases; and when p ! 1, it goes to 0. The Akra-Bazzi method then gives the solution to the recurrence as T .n/ D ‚ Î n p Î 1 C Z n 1 f .x/ x pC1 dx ÏÏ : (4.23) As an example, consider the recurrence T .n/ D T .n=5/ C T .7n=10/ C n : (4.24) We’ll see the similar recurrence (9.1) on page 240 when we study an algorithm for selecting the i th smallest element from a set of n numbers. This recurrence has the form of equation (4.22), where a 1 D a 2 D 1, b 1 D 5, b 2 D 10=7, and f .n/ D n. To solve it, the Akra-Bazzi method says that we should determine the unique p satisfying 1 5 Ï p C Î 7 10 Ï p D 1 : Solving for p is kind of messy4it turns out that p D 0:83978 : : :4but we can solve the recurrence without actually knowing the exact value for p. Observe that .1=5/ 0 C .7=10/ 0 D 2 and .1=5/ 1 C .7=10/ 1 D 9=10, and thus p lies in the range 0 < p < 1. That turns out to be sufûcient for the Akra-Bazzi method to give us the solution. We’ll use the fact from calculus that if k ¤ 1, then R x k dx D x kC1 =.k C 1/, which we’ll apply with k D p ¤ 1. The Akra-Bazzi 118 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer solution (4.23) gives us T .n/ D ‚ Î n p Î 1 C Z n 1 f .x/ x pC1 dx ÏÏ D ‚ Î n p Î 1 C Z n 1 x p dx ÏÏ D ‚ Î n p Î 1 C Ð x 1p 1  p  n 1 ÏÏ D ‚ Î n p Î 1 C Î n 1p 1  p  1 1  p ÏÏÏ D ‚ ã n p  ‚.n 1p / ä (because 1  p is a positive constant) D ‚.n/ (by Problem 3-5(d)) . Although the Akra-Bazzi method is more general than the master theorem, it requires calculus and sometimes a bit more reasoning. You also must ensure that your driving function satisûes the polynomial-growth condition if you want to ig- nore üoors and ceilings, although that’s rarely a problem. When it applies, the master method is much simpler to use, but only when subproblem sizes are more or less equal. They are both good tools for your algorithmic toolkit.

This assumption is valid in most systems because a pointer to the array is passed, not the array itself. This problem examines the implications of three parameter-passing strategies: 1. Arrays are passed by pointer. Time D ‚.1/. 2. Arrays are passed by copying. Time D ‚.N /, where N is the size of the array. 3. Arrays are passed by copying only the subrange that might be accessed by the called procedure. Time D ‚.n/ if the subarray contains n elements. Consider the following three algorithms: a. The recursive binary-search algorithm for ûnding a number in a sorted array (see Exercise 2.3-6). b. The MERGE-SORT procedure from Section 2.3.1. c. The MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure from Section 4.1. Give nine recurrences T a1 .N; n/; T a2 .N; n/; : : : ; T c3 .N; n/ for the worst-case run- ning times of each of the three algorithms above when arrays and matrices are passed using each of the three parameter-passing strategies above.

Prove that F i C2  � i for i  0. 4-6 Chip testing Professor Diogenes has n supposedly identical integrated-circuit chips that in prin- ciple are capable of testing each other. The professor’s test jig accommodates two chips at a time. When the jig is loaded, each chip tests the other and reports whether it is good or bad. A good chip always reports accurately whether the other chip is good or bad, but the professor cannot trust the answer of a bad chip. Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows: Chip A says Chip B says Conclusion B is good A is good both are good, or both are bad B is good A is bad at least one is bad B is bad A is good at least one is bad B is bad A is bad at least one is bad a. Show that if at least n=2 chips are bad, the professor cannot necessarily deter- mine which chips are good using any strategy based on this kind of pairwise test. Assume that the bad chips can conspire to fool the professor. Problems for Chapter 4 123 Now you will design an algorithm to identify which chips are good and which are bad, assuming that more than n=2 of the chips are good. First, you will determine how to identify one good chip. b. Show that bn=2c pairwise tests are sufûcient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size. That is, show how to use bn=2c pairwise tests to obtain a set with at most dn=2e chips that still has the property that more than half of the chips are good. c. Show how to apply the solution to part (b) recursively to identify one good chip. Give and solve the recurrence that describes the number of tests needed to identify one good chip. You have now determined how to identify one good chip. d. Show how to identify all the good chips with an additional ‚.n/ pairwise tests. 4-7 Monge arrays An m  n array A of real numbers is a Monge array if for all i , j , k, and l such that 1 හ i < k හ m and 1 හ j < l හ n, we have AŒi; j � C AŒk; l� හ AŒi; l� C AŒk; j � : In other words, whenever we pick two rows and two columns of a Monge array and consider the four elements at the intersections of the rows and the columns, the sum of the upper-left and lower-right elements is less than or equal to the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements. For example, the following array is Monge: 10 17 13 28 23 17 22 16 29 23 24 28 22 34 24 11 13 6 17 7 45 44 32 37 23 36 33 19 21 6 75 66 51 53 34 a.

The following array is not Monge. Change one element in order to make it Monge. (Hint: Use part (a).) 124 Chapter 4 Divide-and-Conquer 37 23 22 32 21 6 7 10 53 34 30 31 32 13 9 6 43 21 15 8 c.

Here is a description of a divide-and-conquer algorithm that computes the left- most minimum element in each row of an m  n Monge array A: Construct a submatrix A 0 of A consisting of the even-numbered rows of A. Recursively determine the leftmost minimum for each row of A 0 . Then compute the leftmost minimum in the odd-numbered rows of A. Explain how to compute the leftmost minimum in the odd-numbered rows of A (given that the leftmost minimum of the even-numbered rows is known) in O.m C n/ time. e. Write the recurrence for the running time of the algorithm in part (d). Show that its solution is O.m C n log m/. Chapter notes Divide-and-conquer as a technique for designing algorithms dates back at least to 1962 in an article by Karatsuba and Ofman [242], but it might have been used well before then. According to Heideman, Johnson, and Burrus [211], C. F. Gauss devised the ûrst fast Fourier transform algorithm in 1805, and Gauss’s formulation breaks the problem into smaller subproblems whose solutions are combined. Strassen’s algorithm [424] caused much excitement when it appeared in 1969. Before then, few imagined the possibility of an algorithm asymptotically faster than the basic MATRIX-MULTIPLY procedure. Shortly thereafter, S. Winograd reduced the number of submatrix additions from 18 to 15 while still using seven submatrix multiplications. This improvement, which Winograd apparently never published (and which is frequently miscited in the literature), may enhance the practicality of the method, but it does not affect its asymptotic performance. Probert [368] described Winograd’s algorithm and showed that with seven multiplications, 15 additions is the minimum possible. Strassen’s ‚.n lg 7 / D O.n 2:81 / bound for matrix multiplication held until 1987, when Coppersmith and Winograd [103] made a signiûcant advance, improving the Notes for Chapter 4 125 bound to O.n 2:376 / time with a mathematically sophisticated but wildly impracti- cal algorithm based on tensor products. It took approximately 25 years before the asymptotic upper bound was again improved. In 2012 Vassilevska Williams [445] improved it to O.n 2:37287 /, and two years later Le Gall [278] achieved O.n 2:37286 /, both of them using mathematically fascinating but impractical algorithms. The best lower bound to date is just the obvious �.n 2 / bound (obvious because any algo- rithm for matrix multiplication must ûll in the n 2 elements of the product matrix). The performance of MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE can be improved in prac- tice by coarsening the leaves of the recursion. It also exhibits better cache behav- ior than MATRIX-MULTIPLY, although MATRIX-MULTIPLY can be improved by <tiling.= Leiserson et al. [293] conducted a performance-engineering study of ma- trix multiplication in which a parallel and vectorized divide-and-conquer algorithm achieved the highest performance. Strassen’s algorithm can be practical for large dense matrices, although large matrices tend to be sparse, and sparse methods can be much faster. When using limited-precision üoating-point values, Strassen’s al- gorithm produces larger numerical errors than the ‚.n 3 / algorithms do, although Higham [215] demonstrated that Strassen’s algorithm is amply accurate for some applications. Recurrences were studied as early as 1202 by Leonardo Bonacci [66], also known as Fibonacci, for whom the Fibonacci numbers are named, although Indian mathematicians had discovered Fibonacci numbers centuries before. The French mathematician De Moivre [108] introduced the method of generating functions with which he studied Fibonacci numbers (see Problem 4-5). Knuth [259] and Liu [302] are good resources for learning the method of generating functions. Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5, 6] offered one of the ûrst general methods for solving recurrences arising from the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The master method was adapted from Bentley, Haken, and Saxe [52]. The Akra- Bazzi method is due (unsurprisingly) to Akra and Bazzi [13]. Divide-and-conquer recurrences have been studied by many researchers, including Campbell [79], Gra- ham, Knuth, and Patashnik [199], Kuszmaul and Leiserson [274], Leighton [287], Purdom and Brown [371], Roura [389], Verma [447], and Yap [462]. The issue of üoors and ceilings in divide-and-conquer recurrences, including a theorem similar to Theorem 4.5, was studied by Leighton [287]. Leighton pro- posed a version of the polynomial-growth condition. Campbell [79] removed sev- eral limitations in Leighton’s statement of it and showed that there were polyno- mially bounded functions that do not satisfy Leighton’s condition. Campbell also carefully studied many other technical issues, including the well-deûnedness of divide-and-conquer recurrences. Kuszmaul and Leiserson [274] provided a proof of Theorem 4.5 that does not involve calculus or other higher math. Both Camp- bell and Leighton explored the perturbations of arguments beyond simple üoors and ceilings. 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms This chapter introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of probability theory, you should read Sections C.13C.4 of Appendix C, which review this material. We’ll revisit probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms several times throughout this book. 5.1 The hiring problem Suppose that you need to hire a new ofûce assistant. Your previous attempts at hiring have been unsuccessful, and you decide to use an employment agency. The employment agency sends you one candidate each day. You interview that person and then decide either to hire that person or not. You must pay the employment agency a small fee to interview an applicant. To actually hire an applicant is more costly, however, since you must ûre your current ofûce assistant and also pay a substantial hiring fee to the employment agency. You are committed to having, at all times, the best possible person for the job. Therefore, you decide that, after interviewing each applicant, if that applicant is better qualiûed than the current ofûce assistant, you will ûre the current ofûce assistant and hire the new applicant. You are willing to pay the resulting price of this strategy, but you wish to estimate what that price will be. The procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT on the facing page expresses this strategy for hiring in pseudocode. The candidates for the ofûce assistant job are numbered 1 through n and interviewed in that order. The procedure assumes that after inter- viewing candidate i , you can determine whether candidate i is the best candidate you have seen so far. It starts by creating a dummy candidate, numbered 0, who is less qualiûed than each of the other candidates. The cost model for this problem differs from the model described in Chapter 2. We focus not on the running time of HIRE-ASSISTANT, but instead on the fees paid for interviewing and hiring. On the surface, analyzing the cost of this algorithm 5.1 The hiring problem 127 HIRE-ASSISTANT .n/ 1 best D 0 // candidate 0 is a least-qualiûed dummy candidate 2 for i D 1 to n 3 interview candidate i 4 if candidate i is better than candidate best 5 best D i 6 hire candidate i may seem very different from analyzing the running time of, say, merge sort. The analytical techniques used, however, are identical whether we are analyzing cost or running time. In either case, we are counting the number of times certain basic operations are executed. Interviewing has a low cost, say c i , whereas hiring is expensive, costing c h . Let- ting m be the number of people hired, the total cost associated with this algorithm is O.c i n C c h m/. No matter how many people you hire, you always interview n candidates and thus always incur the cost c i n associated with interviewing. We therefore concentrate on analyzing c h m, the hiring cost. This quantity depends on the order in which you interview candidates. This scenario serves as a model for a common computational paradigm. Al- gorithms often need to ûnd the maximum or minimum value in a sequence by examining each element of the sequence and maintaining a current <winner.= The hiring problem models how often a procedure updates its notion of which element is currently winning. Worst-case analysis In the worst case, you actually hire every candidate that you interview. This situa- tion occurs if the candidates come in strictly increasing order of quality, in which case you hire n times, for a total hiring cost of O.c h n/. Of course, the candidates do not always come in increasing order of quality. In fact, you have no idea about the order in which they arrive, nor do you have any control over this order. Therefore, it is natural to ask what we expect to happen in a typical or average case. Probabilistic analysis Probabilistic analysis is the use of probability in the analysis of problems. Most commonly, we use probabilistic analysis to analyze the running time of an algo- rithm. Sometimes we use it to analyze other quantities, such as the hiring cost in 128 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT. In order to perform a probabilistic analysis, we must use knowledge of, or make assumptions about, the distribution of the inputs. Then we analyze our algorithm, computing an average-case running time, where we take the average, or expected value, over the distribution of the possible inputs. When reporting such a running time, we refer to it as the average-case running time. You must be careful in deciding on the distribution of inputs. For some problems, you may reasonably assume something about the set of all possible inputs, and then you can use probabilistic analysis as a technique for designing an efûcient algorithm and as a means for gaining insight into a problem. For other problems, you cannot characterize a reasonable input distribution, and in these cases you cannot use probabilistic analysis. For the hiring problem, we can assume that the applicants come in a random order. What does that mean for this problem? We assume that you can compare any two candidates and decide which one is better qualiûed, which is to say that there is a total order on the candidates. (See Section B.2 for the deûnition of a total order.) Thus, you can rank each candidate with a unique number from 1 through n, using rank.i / to denote the rank of applicant i , and adopt the convention that a higher rank corresponds to a better qualiûed applicant. The ordered list hrank.1/; rank.2/; : : : ; rank.n/i is a permutation of the list h1; 2; : : : ; ni. Saying that the applicants come in a random order is equivalent to saying that this list of ranks is equally likely to be any one of the nŠ permutations of the numbers 1 through n. Alternatively, we say that the ranks form a uniform random permutation, that is, each of the possible nŠ permutations appears with equal probability. Section 5.2 contains a probabilistic analysis of the hiring problem. Randomized algorithms In order to use probabilistic analysis, you need to know something about the dis- tribution of the inputs. In many cases, you know little about the input distribu- tion. Even if you do know something about the distribution, you might not be able to model this knowledge computationally. Yet, probability and randomness often serve as tools for algorithm design and analysis, by making part of the algorithm behave randomly. In the hiring problem, it may seem as if the candidates are being presented to you in a random order, but you have no way of knowing whether they really are. Thus, in order to develop a randomized algorithm for the hiring problem, you need greater control over the order in which you’ll interview the candidates. We will, therefore, change the model slightly. The employment agency sends you a list of the n candidates in advance. On each day, you choose, randomly, which candi- date to interview. Although you know nothing about the candidates (besides their names), we have made a signiûcant change. Instead of accepting the order given 5.1 The hiring problem 129 to you by the employment agency and hoping that it’s random, you have instead gained control of the process and enforced a random order. More generally, we call an algorithm randomized if its behavior is determined not only by its input but also by values produced by a random-number generator. We assume that we have at our disposal a random-number generator RANDOM. A call to RANDOM.a; b/ returns an integer between a and b, inclusive, with each such integer being equally likely. For example, R ANDOM.0; 1/ produces 0 with probability 1=2, and it produces 1 with probability 1=2. A call to RANDOM.3; 7/ returns any one of 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, each with probability 1=5. Each integer returned by RANDOM is independent of the integers returned on previous calls. You may imagine RANDOM as rolling a .b  a C 1/-sided die to obtain its output. (In prac- tice, most programming environments offer a pseudorandom-number generator: a deterministic algorithm returning numbers that <look= statistically random.) When analyzing the running time of a randomized algorithm, we take the expec- tation of the running time over the distribution of values returned by the random number generator. We distinguish these algorithms from those in which the input is random by referring to the running time of a randomized algorithm as an ex- pected running time. In general, we discuss the average-case running time when the probability distribution is over the inputs to the algorithm, and we discuss the expected running time when the algorithm itself makes random choices. Exercises 5.1-1 Show that the assumption that you are always able to determine which candidate is best, in line 4 of procedure HIRE-ASSISTANT, implies that you know a total order on the ranks of the candidates. ? 5.1-2 Describe an implementation of the procedure R ANDOM.a; b/ that makes calls only to RANDOM.0; 1/. What is the expected running time of your procedure, as a function of a and b? ? 5.1-3 You wish to implement a program that outputs 0 with probability 1=2 and 1 with probability 1=2. At your disposal is a procedure B IASED-RANDOM that outputs either 0 or 1, but it outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1  p, where 0 < p < 1. You do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1=2 and 1 with probability 1=2. What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of p? 130 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms 5.2 Indicator random variables In order to analyze many algorithms, including the hiring problem, we use indicator random variables. Indicator random variables provide a convenient method for converting between probabilities and expectations. Given a sample space S and an event A, the indicator random variable I fAg associated with event A is deûned as I fAg D ( 1 if A occurs ; 0 if A does not occur : (5.1) As a simple example, let us determine the expected number of heads obtained when üipping a fair coin. The sample space for a single coin üip is S D fH; T g, with Pr fH g D Pr fT g D 1=2. We can then deûne an indicator random vari- able X H , associated with the coin coming up heads, which is the event H . This variable counts the number of heads obtained in this üip, and it is 1 if the coin comes up heads and 0 otherwise. We write X H D I fH g D ( 1 if H occurs ; 0 if T occurs : The expected number of heads obtained in one üip of the coin is simply the ex- pected value of our indicator variable X H : E ŒX H � D E ŒI fH g� D 1  Pr fH g C 0  Pr fT g D 1  .1=2/ C 0  .1=2/ D 1=2 : Thus the expected number of heads obtained by one üip of a fair coin is 1=2. As the following lemma shows, the expected value of an indicator random variable associated with an event A is equal to the probability that A occurs. Lemma 5.1 Given a sample space S and an event A in the sample space S , let X A D I fAg. Then E ŒX A � D Pr fAg. Proof By the deûnition of an indicator random variable from equation (5.1) and the deûnition of expected value, we have E ŒX A � D E ŒI fAg� D 1  Pr fAg C 0  Pr ˚ A  D Pr fAg ; 5.2 Indicator random variables 131 where A denotes S  A, the complement of A. Although indicator random variables may seem cumbersome for an applica- tion such as counting the expected number of heads on a üip of a single coin, they are useful for analyzing situations that perform repeated random trials. In Appendix C, for example, indicator random variables provide a simple way to determine the expected number of heads in n coin üips. One option is to con- sider separately the probability of obtaining 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, etc. to ar- rive at the result of equation (C.41) on page 1199. Alternati vely, we can employ the simpler method proposed in equation (C.42), which uses indicator random variables implicitly. Making this argument more explicit, let X i be the indicator random variable associated with the event in which the i th üip comes up heads: X i D I fthe i th üip results in the event H g. Let X be the random variable denot- ing the total number of heads in the n coin üips, so that X D n X i D1 X i : In order to compute the expected number of heads, take the expectation of both sides of the above equation to obtain E ŒX � D E \" n X i D1 X i # : (5.2) By Lemma 5.1, the expectation of each of the random variables is E ŒX i � D 1=2 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Then we can compute the sum of the expectations: P n i D1 E ŒX i � D n=2. But equation (5.2) calls for the expectation of the sum, not the sum of the ex- pectations. How can we resolve this conundrum? Linearity of expectation, equa- tion (C.24) on page 1192, to the rescue: the expectation of the sum always equals the sum of the expectations. Linearity of expectation applies even when there is dependence among the random variables. Combining indicator random variables with linearity of expectation gives us a powerful technique to compute expected values when multiple events occur. We now can compute the expected number of heads: E ŒX � D E \" n X i D1 X i # D n X i D1 E ŒX i � D n X i D1 1=2 D n=2 : 132 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Thus, compared with the method used in equation (C.41), indicator random vari- ables greatly simplify the calculation. We use indicator random variables through- out this book. Analysis of the hiring problem using indicator random variables Returning to the hiring problem, we now wish to compute the expected number of times that you hire a new ofûce assistant. In order to use a probabilistic analysis, let’s assume that the candidates arrive in a random order, as discussed in Sec- tion 5.1. (We’ll see in Section 5.3 how to remove this assumption.) Let X be the random variable whose value equals the number of times you hire a new ofûce as- sistant. We could then apply the deûnition of expected value from equation (C.23) on page 1192 to obtain E ŒX � D n X xD1 x Pr fX D x g ; but this calculation would be cumbersome. Instead, let’s simplify the calculation by using indicator random variables. To use indicator random variables, instead of computing E ŒX � by deûning just one variable denoting the number of times you hire a new ofûce assistant, think of the process of hiring as repeated random trials and deûne n variables indicating whether each particular candidate is hired. In particular, let X i be the indicator random variable associated with the event in which the i th candidate is hired. Thus, X i D I fcandidate i is hiredg D ( 1 if candidate i is hired ; 0 if candidate i is not hired ; and D X 1 C X 2 C    C X n : (5.3) Lemma 5.1 gives E ŒX i � D Pr fcandidate i is hiredg ; and we must therefore compute the probability that lines 536 of HIRE-ASSISTANT are executed. Candidate i is hired, in line 6, exactly when candidate i is better than each of candidates 1 through i  1. Because we have assumed that the candidates arrive in a random order, the ûrst i candidates have appeared in a random order. Any one of these ûrst i candidates is equally likely to be the best qualiûed so far. Candidate i has a probability of 1=i of being better qualiûed than candidates 1 through i  1 and thus a probability of 1=i of being hired. By Lemma 5.1, we conclude that 5.2 Indicator random variables 133 E ŒX i � D 1=i : (5.4) Now we can compute E ŒX �: E ŒX � D E \" n X i D1 X i # (by equation (5.3)) (5.5) D n X i D1 E ŒX i � (by equation (C.24), linearity of expectation) D n X i D1 1 i (by equation (5.4)) D ln n C O.1/ (by equation (A.9), the harmonic series) . (5.6) Even though you interview n people, you actually hire only approximately ln n of them, on average. We summarize this result in the following lemma. Lemma 5.2 Assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, algorithm H IRE- ASSISTANT has an average-case total hiring cost of O.c h ln n/. Proof The bound follows immediately from our deûnition of the hiring cost and equation (5.6), which shows that the expected number of hires is approxi- mately ln n. The average-case hiring cost is a signiûcant improvement over the worst-case hiring cost of O.c h n/. Exercises 5.2-1 In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random or- der, what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability that you hire exactly n times? 5.2-2 In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random or- der, what is the probability that you hire exactly twice? 5.2-3 Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of n dice. 134 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms 5.2-4 This exercise asks you to (partly) verify that linearity of expectation holds even if the random variables are not independent. Consider two 6-sided dice that are rolled independently. What is the expected value of the sum? Now consider the case where the ûrst die is rolled normally and then the second die is set equal to the value shown on the ûrst die. What is the expected value of the sum? Now consider the case where the ûrst die is rolled normally and the second die is set equal to 7 minus the value of the ûrst die. What is the expected value of the sum? 5.2-5 Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem, which is known as the hat-check problem. Each of n customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a restaurant. The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers in a random order. What is the expected number of customers who get back their own hat? 5.2-6 Let AŒ1 W n� be an array of n distinct numbers. If i < j and AŒi � > AŒj �, then the pair .i; j / is called an inversion of A. (See Problem 2-4 on page 47 for more on inversions.) Suppose that the elements of A form a uniform random permutation of h1; 2; : : : ; ni. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions. 5.3 Randomized algorithms In the previous section, we showed how knowing a distribution on the inputs can help us to analyze the average-case behavior of an algorithm. What if you do not know the distribution? Then you cannot perform an average-case analysis. As mentioned in Section 5.1, however, you might be able to use a randomized algorithm. For a problem such as the hiring problem, in which it is helpful to assume that all permutations of the input are equally likely, a probabilistic analysis can guide us when developing a randomized algorithm. Instead of assuming a distribution of inputs, we impose a distribution. In particular, before running the algorithm, let’s randomly permute the candidates in order to enforce the property that every permutation is equally likely. Although we have modiûed the algorithm, we still expect to hire a new ofûce assistant approximately ln n times. But now we expect this to be the case for any input, rather than for inputs drawn from a particular distribution. Let us further explore the distinction between probabilistic analysis and ran- domized algorithms. In Section 5.2, we claimed that, assuming that the candidates 5.3 Randomized algorithms 135 arrive in a random order, the expected number of times you hire a new ofûce as- sistant is about ln n. This algorithm is deterministic: for any particular input, the number of times a new ofûce assistant is hired is always the same. Furthermore, the number of times you hire a new ofûce assistant differs for different inputs, and it depends on the ranks of the various candidates. Since this number depends only on the ranks of the candidates, to represent a particular input, we can just list, in order, the ranks hrank.1/; rank.2/; : : : ; rank.n/i of the candidates. Given the rank list A 1 D h1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10i, a new ofûce assistant is always hired 10 times, since each successive candidate is better than the previous one, and lines 536 of HIRE-ASSISTANT are executed in each iteration. Given the list of ranks A 2 D h10; 9; 8; 7; 6; 5; 4; 3; 2; 1i, a new ofûce assistant is hired only once, in the ûrst iteration. Given a list of ranks A 3 D h5; 2; 1; 8; 4; 7; 10; 9; 3; 6i, a new ofûce assistant is hired three times, upon interviewing the candidates with ranks 5, 8, and 10. Recalling that the cost of our algorithm depends on how many times you hire a new ofûce assistant, we see that there are expensive inputs such as A 1 , inexpensive inputs such as A 2 , and moderately expensive inputs such as A 3 . Consider, on the other hand, the randomized algorithm that ûrst permutes the list of candidates and then determines the best candidate. In this case, we randomize in the algorithm, not in the input distribution. Given a particular input, say A 3 above, we cannot say how many times the maximum is updated, because this quantity differs with each run of the algorithm. The ûrst time you run the algorithm on A 3 , it might produce the permutation A 1 and perform 10 updates. But the second time you run the algorithm, it might produce the permutation A 2 and perform only one update. The third time you run the algorithm, it might perform some other number of updates. Each time you run the algorithm, its execution depends on the random choices made and is likely to differ from the previous execution of the algorithm. For this algorithm and many other randomized algorithms, no particular input elicits its worst-case behavior. Even your worst enemy cannot produce a bad input array, since the random permutation makes the input order irrelevant. The randomized algorithm performs badly only if the random-number generator produces an <unlucky= permutation. For the hiring problem, the only change needed in the code is to randomly per- mute the array, as done in the RANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT procedure. This simple change creates a randomized algorithm whose performance matches that obtained by assuming that the candidates were presented in a random order. RANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT .n/ 1 randomly permute the list of candidates 2 HIRE-ASSISTANT .n/ 136 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Lemma 5.3 The expected hiring cost of the procedure R ANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT is O.c h ln n/. Proof Permuting the input array achieves a situation identical to that of the prob- abilistic analysis of HIRE-ASSISTANT in Section 5.2. By carefully comparing Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3, you can see the difference between probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms. Lemma 5.2 makes an assump- tion about the input. Lemma 5.3 makes no such assumption, although randomizing the input takes some additional time. To remain consistent with our terminology, we couched Lemma 5.2 in terms of the average-case hiring cost and Lemma 5.3 in terms of the expected hiring cost. In the remainder of this section, we discuss some issues involved in randomly permuting inputs. Randomly permuting arrays Many randomized algorithms randomize the input by permuting a given input ar- ray. We’ll see elsewhere in this book other ways to randomize an algorithm, but now, let’s see how we can randomly permute an array of n elements. The goal is to produce a uniform random permutation, that is, a permutation that is as likely as any other permutation. Since there are nŠ possible permutations, we want the probability that any particular permutation is produced to be 1=nŠ. You might think that to prove that a permutation is a uniform random permuta- tion, it sufûces to show that, for each element AŒi �, the probability that the element winds up in position j is 1=n. Exercise 5.3-4 shows that this weaker condition is, in fact, insufûcient. Our method to generate a random permutation permutes the array in place: at most a constant number of elements of the input array are ever stored outside the array. The procedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE permutes an array AŒ1 W n� in place in ‚.n/ time. In its i th iteration, it chooses the element AŒi � randomly from among elements AŒi � through AŒn�. After the i th iteration, AŒi � is never altered. RANDOMLY-PERMUTE .A; n/ 1 for i D 1 to n 2 swap AŒi � with AŒRANDOM.i; n/� We use a loop invariant to show that procedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE produces a uniform random permutation. A k-permutation on a set of n elements is a se- 5.3 Randomized algorithms 137 quence containing k of the n elements, with no repetitions. (See page 1180 in Appendix C.) There are nŠ=.n  k/Š such possible k-permutations. Lemma 5.4 Procedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE computes a uniform random permutation. Proof We use the following loop invariant: Just prior to the i th iteration of the for loop of lines 132, for each possible .i  1/-permutation of the n elements, the subarray AŒ1 W i  1� contains this .i  1/-permutation with probability .n  i C 1/Š=nŠ. We need to show that this invariant is true prior to the ûrst loop iteration, that each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant, that the loop terminates, and that the invariant provides a useful property to show correctness when the loop terminates. Initialization: Consider the situation just before the ûrst loop iteration, so that i D 1. The loop invariant says that for each possible 0-permutation, the sub- array AŒ1 W 0� contains this 0-permutation with probability .n  i C 1/Š=nŠ D nŠ=nŠ D 1. The subarray AŒ1 W 0� is an empty subarray, and a 0-permutation has no elements. Thus, AŒ1 W 0� contains any 0-permutation with probability 1, and the loop invariant holds prior to the ûrst iteration. Maintenance: By the loop invariant, we assume that just before the i th iteration, each possible .i  1/-permutation appears in the subarray AŒ1 W i  1� with prob- ability .n  i C 1/Š=nŠ. We shall show that after the i th iteration, each possible i -permutation appears in the subarray AŒ1 W i � with probability .n  i /Š=nŠ. In- crementing i for the next iteration then maintains the loop invariant. Let us examine the i th iteration. Consider a particular i -permutation, and de- note the elements in it by hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x i i. This permutation consists of an .i  1/-permutation hx 1 ; : : : ; x i 1 i followed by the value x i that the algorithm places in AŒi �. Let E 1 denote the event in which the ûrst i  1 iterations have created the particular .i  1/-permutation hx 1 ; : : : ; x i 1 i in AŒ1 W i  1�. By the loop invariant, Pr fE 1 g D .n  i C 1/Š=nŠ. Let E 2 be the event that the i th iteration puts x i in position AŒi �. The i -permutation hx 1 ; : : : ; x i i appears in AŒ1 W i � precisely when both E 1 and E 2 occur, and so we wish to compute Pr fE 2 \\ E 1 g. Using equation (C.16) on page 1187, we have Pr fE 2 \\ E 1 g D Pr fE 2 j E 1 g Pr fE 1 g : The probability Pr fE 2 j E 1 g equals 1=.ni C1/ because in line 2 the algorithm chooses x i randomly from the n  i C 1 values in positions AŒi W n�. Thus, we have 138 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Pr fE 2 \\ E 1 g D Pr fE 2 j E 1 g Pr fE 1 g D 1 n  i C 1  .n  i C 1/Š nŠ D .n  i /Š nŠ : Termination: The loop terminates, since it is a for loop iterating n times. At termination, i D n C 1, and we have that the subarray AŒ1 W n� is a given n-permutation with probability .n  .n C 1/ C 1/Š=nŠ D 0Š=nŠ D 1=nŠ. Thus, RANDOMLY-PERMUTE produces a uniform random permutation. A randomized algorithm is often the simplest and most efûcient way to solve a problem. Exercises 5.3-1 Professor Marceau objects to the loop invariant used in the proof of Lemma 5.4. He questions whether it holds prior to the ûrst iteration. He reasons that we could just as easily declare that an empty subarray contains no 0-permutations. Therefore, the probability that an empty subarray contains a 0-permutation should be 0, thus invalidating the loop invariant prior to the ûrst iteration. Rewrite the procedure RANDOMLY-PERMUTE so that its associated loop invariant applies to a nonempty subarray prior to the ûrst iteration, and modify the proof of Lemma 5.4 for your procedure. 5.3-2 Professor Kelp decides to write a procedure that produces at random any permu- tation except the identity permutation, in which every element ends up where it started. He proposes the procedure PERMUTE-WITHOUT-I DENTITY. Does this procedure do what Professor Kelp intends?

One way is to set AŒi � D i , for i D 1; 2; 3; : : : ; n, call RANDOMLY-PERMUTE .A/, and then take just the ûrst m array elements. This method makes n calls to the RANDOM procedure. In Professor Gallup’s applica- tion, n is much larger than m, and so the professor wants to create a random sample with fewer calls to RANDOM.

The ûrst determines the probability that in a room of k people, two of them share the same birthday. The second example examines what happens when ran- domly tossing balls into bins. The third investigates <streaks= of consecutive heads when üipping coins. The ûnal example analyzes a variant of the hiring problem in which you have to make decisions without actually interviewing all the candidates. 5.4.1 The birthday paradox Our ûrst example is the birthday paradox. How many people must there be in a room before there is a 50% chance that two of them were born on the same day of the year? The answer is surprisingly few. The paradox is that it is in fact far fewer than the number of days in a year, or even half the number of days in a year, as we shall see. To answer this question, we index the people in the room with the integers 1; 2; : : : ; k, where k is the number of people in the room. We ignore the issue of leap years and assume that all years have n D 365 days. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, let b i be the day of the year on which person i ’s birthday falls, where 1 හ b i හ n. We also assume that birthdays are uniformly distributed across the n days of the year, so that Pr fb i D r g D 1=n for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k and r D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The probability that two given people, say i and j , have matching birthdays depends on whether the random selection of birthdays is independent. We assume from now on that birthdays are independent, so that the probability that i ’s birthday and j ’s birthday both fall on day r is Pr fb i D r and b j D r g D Pr fb i D r g Pr fb j D r g D 1 n 2 : Thus, the probability that they both fall on the same day is Pr fb i D b j g D n X r D1 Pr fb i D r and b j D r g 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 141 D n X r D1 1 n 2 D 1 n : (5.7) More intuitively, once b i is chosen, the probability that b j is chosen to be the same day is 1=n. As long as the birthdays are independent, the probability that i and j have the same birthday is the same as the probability that the birthday of one of them falls on a given day. We can analyze the probability of at least 2 out of k people having matching birthdays by looking at the complementary event. The probability that at least two of the birthdays match is 1 minus the probability that all the birthdays are different. The event B k that k people have distinct birthdays is B k D k \\ i D1 A i ; where A i is the event that person i ’s birthday is different from person j ’s for all j < i . Since we can write B k D A k \\ B k1 , we obtain from equation (C.18) on page 1189 the recurrence Pr fB k g D Pr fB k1 g Pr fA k j B k1 g ; (5.8) where we take Pr fB 1 g D Pr fA 1 g D 1 as an initial condition. In other words, the probability that b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k are distinct birthdays equals the probability that b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k1 are distinct birthdays multiplied by the probability that b k ¤ b i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k  1, given that b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k1 are distinct. If b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k1 are distinct, the conditional probability that b k ¤ b i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k  1 is Pr fA k j B k1 g D .n  k C 1/=n, since out of the n days, n  .k  1/ days are not taken. We iteratively apply the recurrence (5.8) to obtain Pr fB k g D Pr fB k1 g Pr fA k j B k1 g D Pr fB k2 g Pr fA k1 j B k2 g Pr fA k j B k1 g : : : D Pr fB 1 g Pr fA 2 j B 1 g Pr fA 3 j B 2 g    Pr fA k j B k1 g D 1  Î n  1 n Ï Î n  2 n Ï    Î n  k C 1 n Ï D 1  Î 1  1 n Ï Î 1  2 n Ï    Î 1  k  1 n Ï : Inequality (3.14) on page 66, 1 C x හ e x , gives us 142 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Pr fB k g හ e 1=n e 2=n    e .k1/=n D e  P k1 i D1 i=n D e k.k1/=2n හ 1 2 when k.k  1/=2n හ ln.1=2/. The probability that all k birthdays are distinct is at most 1=2 when k.k  1/  2n ln 2 or, solving the quadratic equation, when k  .1 C p 1 C .8 ln 2/n/=2. For n D 365, we must have k  23. Thus, if at least 23 people are in a room, the probability is at least 1=2 that at least two people have the same birthday. Since a year on Mars is 669 Martian days long, it takes 31 Martians to get the same effect. An analysis using indicator random variables Indicator random variables afford a simpler but approximate analysis of the birth- day paradox. For each pair .i; j / of the k people in the room, deûne the indicator random variable X ij , for 1 හ i < j හ k, by X ij D I fperson i and person j have the same birthdayg D ( 1 if person i and person j have the same birthday ; 0 otherwise : By equation (5.7), the probability that two people have matching birthdays is 1=n, and thus by Lemma 5.1 on page 130, we have E ŒX ij � D Pr fperson i and person j have the same birthdayg D 1=n : Letting X be the random variable that counts the number of pairs of individuals having the same birthday, we have D k1 X i D1 k X j Di C1 X ij : Taking expectations of both sides and applying linearity of expectation, we obtain E ŒX � D E \" k1 X i D1 k X j Di C1 X ij # D k1 X i D1 k X j Di C1 E ŒX ij � 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 143 D  k 2 ! 1 n D k.k  1/ 2n : When k.k  1/  2n, therefore, the expected number of pairs of people with the same birthday is at least 1. Thus, if we have at least p 2n C 1 individuals in a room, we can expect at least two to have the same birthday. For n D 365, if k D 28, the expected number of pairs with the same birthday is .28  27/=.2  365/  1:0356. Thus, with at least 28 people, we expect to ûnd at least one matching pair of birth- days. On Mars, with 669 days per year, we need at least 38 Martians. The ûrst analysis, which used only probabilities, determined the number of peo- ple required for the probability to exceed 1=2 that a matching pair of birthdays exists, and the second analysis, which used indicator random variables, determined the number such that the expected number of matching birthdays is 1. Although the exact numbers of people differ for the two situations, they are the same asymp- totically: ‚. p n/. 5.4.2 Balls and bins Consider a process in which you randomly toss identical balls into b bins, num- bered 1; 2; : : : ; b. The tosses are independent, and on each toss the ball is equally likely to end up in any bin. The probability that a tossed ball lands in any given bin is 1=b. If we view the ball-tossing process as a sequence of Bernoulli trials (see Appendix C.4), where success means that the ball falls in the given bin, then each trial has a probability 1=b of success. This model is particularly useful for analyz- ing hashing (see Chapter 11), and we can answer a variety of interesting questions about the ball-tossing process. (Problem C-2 asks additional questions about balls and bins.) How many balls fall in a given bin? The number of balls that fall in a given bin follows the binomial distribution b.kI n; 1=b/. If you toss n balls, equa- tion (C.41) on page 1199 tells us that the expected number of balls that fall in the given bin is n=b.  How many balls must you toss, on the average, until a given bin contains a ball? The number of tosses until the given bin receives a ball follows the geometric distribution with probability 1=b and, by equation (C.36) on page 1197, the expected number of tosses until success is 1=.1=b/ D b.  How many balls must you toss until every bin contains at least one ball? Let us call a toss in which a ball falls into an empty bin a <hit.= We want to know the expected number n of tosses required to get b hits. 144 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms Using the hits, we can partition the n tosses into stages. The i th stage consists of the tosses after the .i  1/st hit up to and including the i th hit. The ûrst stage consists of the ûrst toss, since you are guaranteed to have a hit when all bins are empty. For each toss during the i th stage, i  1 bins contain balls and b  i C 1 bins are empty. Thus, for each toss in the i th stage, the probability of obtaining a hit is .b  i C 1/=b. Let n i denote the number of tosses in the i th stage. The number of tosses required to get b hits is n D P b i D1 n i . Each random variable n i has a ge- ometric distribution with probability of success .b  i C 1/=b and thus, by equation (C.36), we have E Œn i � D b b  i C 1 : By linearity of expectation, we have E Œn� D E \" b X i D1 n i # D b X i D1 E Œn i � D b X i D1 b b  i C 1 D b b X i D1 1 i (by equation (A.14) on page 1144) D b.ln b C O.1// (by equation (A.9) on page 1142) . It therefore takes approximately b ln b tosses before we can expect that every bin has a ball. This problem is also known as the coupon collector’s problem, which says that if you are trying to collect each of b different coupons, then you should expect to acquire approximately b ln b randomly obtained coupons in order to succeed. 5.4.3 Streaks Suppose that you üip a fair coin n times. What is the longest streak of consecutive heads that you expect to see? We’ll prove upper and lower bounds separately to show that the answer is ‚.lg n/. 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 145 We ûrst prove that the expected length of the longest streak of heads is O.lg n/. The probability that each coin üip is a head is 1=2. Let A i k be the event that a streak of heads of length at least k begins with the i th coin üip or, more precisely, the event that the k consecutive coin üips i; i C 1; : : : ; i C k  1 yield only heads, where 1 හ k හ n and 1 හ i හ n k C1. Since coin üips are mutually independent, for any given event A i k , the probability that all k üips are heads is Pr fA i k g D 1 2 k : (5.9) For k D 2 dlg ne, Pr fA i;2dlg ne g D 1 2 2dlg ne හ 1 2 2 lg n D 1 n 2 ; and thus the probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 dlg ne begins in position i is quite small. There are at most n  2 dlg ne C 1 positions where such a streak can begin. The probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 dlg ne begins anywhere is therefore Pr ( n2dlg neC1 [ i D1 A i;2dlg ne ) හ n2dlg neC1 X i D1 Pr fA i;2dlg ne g (by Boole’s inequality (C.21) on page 1190) හ n2dlg neC1 X i D1 1 n 2 < n X i D1 1 n 2 D 1 n : (5.10) We can use inequality (5.10) to bound the length of the longest streak. For j D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; n, let L j be the event that the longest streak of heads has length exactly j , and let L be the length of the longest streak. By the deûnition of ex- pected value, we have E ŒL� D n X j D0 j Pr fL j g : (5.11) 146 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms We could try to evaluate this sum using upper bounds on each Pr fL j g similar to those computed in inequality (5.10). Unfortunately, this method yields weak bounds. We can use some intuition gained by the above analysis to obtain a good bound, however. For no individual term in the summation in equation (5.11) are both the factors j and Pr fL j g large. Why? When j  2 dlg ne, then Pr fL j g is very small, and when j < 2 dlg ne, then j is fairly small. More precisely, since the events L j for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n are disjoint, the probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 dlg ne begins anywhere is P n j D2dlg ne Pr fL j g. Inequality (5.10) tells us that the probability that a streak of heads of length at least 2 dlg ne begins anywhere is less than 1=n, which means that P n j D2dlg ne Pr fL j g < 1=n. Also, not- ing that P n j D0 Pr fL j g D 1, we have that P 2dlg ne1 j D0 Pr fL j g හ 1. Thus, we obtain E ŒL� D n X j D0 j Pr fL j g D 2dlg ne1 X j D0 j Pr fL j g C n X j D2dlg ne j Pr fL j g < 2dlg ne1 X j D0 .2 dlg ne/ Pr fL j g C n X j D2dlg ne n Pr fL j g D 2 dlg ne 2dlg ne1 X j D0 Pr fL j g C n n X j D2dlg ne Pr fL j g < 2 dlg ne  1 C n  1 n D O.lg n/ : The probability that a streak of heads exceeds r dlg ne üips diminishes quickly with r . Let’s get a rough bound on the probability that a streak of at least r dlg ne heads occurs, for r  1. The probability that a streak of at least r dlg ne heads starts in position i is Pr fA i;r dlg ne g D 1 2 r dlg ne හ 1 n r : A streak of at least r dlg ne heads cannot start in the last n  r dlg ne C 1 üips, but let’s overestimate the probability of such a streak by allowing it to start anywhere within the n coin üips. Then the probability that a streak of at least r dlg ne heads 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 147 occurs is at most Pr ( n [ i D1 A i;r dlg ne ) හ n X i D1 Pr fA i;r dlg ne g (by Boole’s inequality (C.21)) හ n X i D1 1 n r D 1 n r 1 : Equivalently, the probability is at least 1  1=n r 1 that the longest streak has length less than r dlg ne. As an example, during n D 1000 coin üips, the probability of encountering a streak of at least 2 dlg ne D 20 heads is at most 1=n D 1=1000. The chance of a streak of at least 3 dlg ne D 30 heads is at most 1=n 2 D 1=1,000,000. Let’s now prove a complementary lower bound: the expected length of the longest streak of heads in n coin üips is �.lg n/. To prove this bound, we look for streaks of length s by partitioning the n üips into approximately n=s groups of s üips each. If we choose s D b.lg n/=2c, we’ll see that it is likely that at least one of these groups comes up all heads, which means that it’s likely that the longest streak has length at least s D �.lg n/. We’ll then show that the longest streak has expected length �.lg n/. Let’s partition the n coin üips into at least bn= b.lg n/=2cc groups of b.lg n/=2c consecutive üips and bound the probability that no group comes up all heads. By equation (5.9), the probability that the group starting in position i comes up all heads is Pr fA i;b.lg n/=2c g D 1 2 b.lg n/=2c  1 p n : The probability that a streak of heads of length at least b.lg n/=2c does not begin in position i is therefore at most 1  1= p n. Since the bn= b.lg n/=2cc groups are formed from mutually exclusive, independent coin üips, the probability that every one of these groups fails to be a streak of length b.lg n/=2c is at most ã 1  1= p n ä bn=b.lg n/=2cc හ ã 1  1= p n ä n=b.lg n/=2c1 හ ã 1  1= p n ä 2n= lg n1 හ e .2n= lg n1/= p n D O.e  ln n / D O.1=n/ : (5.12) 148 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms For this argument, we used inequality (3.14), 1 C x හ e x , on page 66 and the fact, which you may verify, that .2n= lg n  1/= p n  ln n for sufûciently large n. We want to bound the probability that the longest streak equals or exceeds b.lg n/=2c. To do so, let L be the event that the longest streak of heads equals or exceeds s D b.lg n/=2c. Let L be the complementary event, that the longest streak of heads is strictly less than s , so that Pr fLg C Pr ˚ L  D 1. Let F be the event that every group of s üips fails to be a streak of s heads. By inequality (5.12), we have Pr fF g D O.1=n/. If the longest streak of heads is less than s , then certainly every group of s üips fails to be a streak of s heads, which means that event L implies event F . Of course, event F could occur even if event L does not (for example, if a streak of s or more heads crosses over the boundary between two groups), and so we have Pr ˚ L  හ Pr fF g D O.1=n/. Since Pr fLg C Pr ˚ L  D 1, we have that Pr fLg D 1  Pr ˚ L   1  Pr fF g D 1  O.1=n/ : That is, the probability that the longest streak equals or exceeds b.lg n/=2c is n X j Db.lg n/=2c Pr fL j g  1  O.1=n/ : (5.13) We can now calculate a lower bound on the expected length of the longest streak, beginning with equation (5.11) and proceeding in a manner similar to our analysis of the upper bound: E ŒL� D n X j D0 j Pr fL j g D b.lg n/=2c1 X j D0 j Pr fL j g C n X j Db.lg n/=2c j Pr fL j g  b.lg n/=2c1 X j D0 0  Pr fL j g C n X j Db.lg n/=2c b.lg n/=2c Pr fL j g D 0  b.lg n/=2c1 X j D0 Pr fL j g C b.lg n/=2c n X j Db.lg n/=2c Pr fL j g  0 C b.lg n/=2c .1  O.1=n// (by inequality (5.13)) D �.lg n/ : 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 149 As with the birthday paradox, we can obtain a simpler, but approximate, analysis using indicator random variables. Instead of determining the expected length of the longest streak, we’ll ûnd the expected number of streaks with at least a given length. Let X i k D I fA i k g be the indicator random variable associated with a streak of heads of length at least k beginning with the i th coin üip. To count the total number of such streaks, deûne X k D nkC1 X i D1 X i k : Taking expectations and using linearity of expectation, we have E ŒX k � D E \" nkC1 X i D1 X i k # D nkC1 X i D1 E ŒX i k � D nkC1 X i D1 Pr fA i k g D nkC1 X i D1 1 2 k D n  k C 1 2 k : By plugging in various values for k, we can calculate the expected number of streaks of length at least k. If this expected number is large (much greater than 1), then we expect many streaks of length k to occur, and the probability that one oc- curs is high. If this expected number is small (much less than 1), then we expect to see few streaks of length k, and the probability that one occurs is low. If k D c lg n, for some positive constant c , we obtain E ŒX c lg n � D n  c lg n C 1 2 c lg n D n  c lg n C 1 n c D 1 n c1  .c lg n  1/=n n c1 D ‚.1=n c1 / : If c is large, the expected number of streaks of length c lg n is small, and we con- clude that they are unlikely to occur. On the other hand, if c D 1=2, then we 150 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms obtain E ŒX .1=2/ lg n � D ‚.1=n 1=21 / D ‚.n 1=2 /, and we expect there to be numer- ous streaks of length .1=2/ lg n. Therefore, one streak of such a length is likely to occur. We can conclude that the expected length of the longest streak is ‚.lg n/. 5.4.4 The online hiring problem As a ûnal example, let’s consider a variant of the hiring problem. Suppose now that you do not wish to interview all the candidates in order to ûnd the best one. You also want to avoid hiring and ûring as you ûnd better and better applicants. Instead, you are willing to settle for a candidate who is close to the best, in ex- change for hiring exactly once. You must obey one company requirement: after each interview you must either immediately offer the position to the applicant or immediately reject the applicant. What is the trade-off between minimizing the amount of interviewing and maximizing the quality of the candidate hired? We can model this problem in the following way. After meeting an applicant, you are able to give each one a score. Let score.i / denote the score you give to the i th applicant, and assume that no two applicants receive the same score. After you have seen j applicants, you know which of the j has the highest score, but you do not know whether any of the remaining n  j applicants will receive a higher score. You decide to adopt the strategy of selecting a positive integer k < n, interviewing and then rejecting the ûrst k applicants, and hiring the ûrst applicant thereafter who has a higher score than all preceding applicants. If it turns out that the best-qualiûed applicant was among the ûrst k interviewed, then you hire the nth applicant4the last one interviewed. We formalize this strategy in the procedure ONLINE-MAXIMUM.k; n/, which returns the index of the candidate you wish to hire. ONLINE-MAXIMUM.k; n/ 1 best-score D 1 2 for i D 1 to k 3 if score.i / > best-score 4 best-score D score.i / 5 for i D k C 1 to n 6 if score.i / > best-score 7 return i 8 return n If we determine, for each possible value of k, the probability that you hire the most qualiûed applicant, then you can choose the best possible k and imple- ment the strategy with that value. For the moment, assume that k is ûxed. Let 5.4 Probabilistic analysis and further uses of indicator ra ndom variables 151 M.j / D max fscore.i / W 1 හ i හ j g denote the maximum score among applicants 1 through j . Let S be the event that you succeed in choosing the best-qualiûed applicant, and let S i be the event that you succeed when the best-qualiûed appli- cant is the i th one interviewed. Since the various S i are disjoint, we have that Pr fS g D P n i D1 Pr fS i g. Noting that you never succeed when the best-qualiûed applicant is one of the ûrst k, we have that Pr fS i g D 0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Thus, we obtain Pr fS g D n X i DkC1 Pr fS i g : (5.14) We now compute Pr fS i g. In order to succeed when the best-qualiûed applicant is the i th one, two things must happen. First, the best-qualiûed applicant must be in position i , an event which we denote by B i . Second, the algorithm must not select any of the applicants in positions k C 1 through i  1, which happens only if, for each j such that k C 1 හ j හ i  1, line 6 ûnds that score.j / < best-score. (Be- cause scores are unique, we can ignore the possibility of score.j / D best-score.) In other words, all of the values score.k C 1/ through score.i  1/ must be less than M.k/. If any are greater than M.k/, the algorithm instead returns the index of the ûrst one that is greater. We use O i to denote the event that none of the ap- plicants in position k C 1 through i  1 are chosen. Fortunately, the two events B i and O i are independent. The event O i depends only on the relative ordering of the values in positions 1 through i  1, whereas B i depends only on whether the value in position i is greater than the values in all other positions. The ordering of the values in positions 1 through i  1 does not affect whether the value in position i is greater than all of them, and the value in position i does not affect the ordering of the values in positions 1 through i  1. Thus, we can apply equation (C.17) on page 1188 to obtain Pr fS i g D Pr fB i \\ O i g D Pr fB i g Pr fO i g : We have Pr fB i g D 1=n since the maximum is equally likely to be in any one of the n positions. For event O i to occur, the maximum value in positions 1 through i  1, which is equally likely to be in any of these i  1 positions, must be in one of the ûrst k positions. Consequently, Pr fO i g D k=.i  1/ and Pr fS i g D k=.n.i  1//. Using equation (5.14), we have Pr fS g D n X i DkC1 Pr fS i g D n X i DkC1 k n.i  1/ 152 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms D k n n X i DkC1 1 i  1 D k n n1 X i Dk 1 i : We approximate by integrals to bound this summation from above and below. By the inequalities (A.19) on page 1150, we have Z n k 1 x dx හ n1 X i Dk 1 i හ Z n1 k1 1 x dx : Evaluating these deûnite integrals gives us the bounds k n .ln n  ln k/ හ Pr fS g හ k n .ln.n  1/  ln.k  1// ; which provide a rather tight bound for Pr fS g. Because you wish to maximize your probability of success, let us focus on choosing the value of k that maximizes the lower bound on Pr fS g. (Besides, the lower-bound expression is easier to maximize than the upper-bound expression.) Differentiating the expression .k=n/.ln n ln k/ with respect to k, we obtain 1 n .ln n  ln k  1/ : Setting this derivative equal to 0, we see that you maximize the lower bound on the probability when ln k D ln n  1 D ln.n=e/ or, equivalently, when k D n=e. Thus, if you implement our strategy with k D n=e, you succeed in hiring the best-qualiûed applicant with probability at least 1=e.

Problems 5-1 Probabilistic counting With a b-bit counter, we can ordinarily only count up to 2 b  1. With R. Morris’s probabilistic counting, we can count up to a much larger value at the expense of some loss of precision. We let a counter value of i represent a count of n i for i D 0; 1; : : : ; 2 b  1, where the n i form an increasing sequence of nonnegative values. We assume that the ini- tial value of the counter is 0, representing a count of n 0 D 0. The I NCREMENT operation works on a counter containing the value i in a probabilistic manner. If i D 2 b  1, then the operation reports an overüow error. Otherwise, the I NCRE- MENT operation increases the counter by 1 with probability 1=.n i C1  n i /, and it leaves the counter unchanged with probability 1  1=.n i C1  n i /. 154 Chapter 5 Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms If we select n i D i for all i  0, then the counter is an ordinary one. More interesting situations arise if we select, say, n i D 2 i 1 for i > 0 or n i D F i (the i th Fibonacci number4see equation (3.31) on page 69). For this problem, assume that n 2 b 1 is large enough that the probability of an overüow error is negligible. a. Show that the expected value represented by the counter after n I NCREMENT operations have been performed is exactly n. b. The analysis of the variance of the count represented by the counter depends on the sequence of the n i . Let us consider a simple case: n i D 100i for all i  0. Estimate the variance in the value represented by the register after n I NCREMENT operations have been performed. 5-2 Searching an unsorted array This problem examines three algorithms for searching for a value x in an unsorted array A consisting of n elements. Consider the following randomized strategy: pick a random index i into A. If AŒi � D x , then terminate; otherwise, continue the search by picking a new random index into A. Continue picking random indices into A until you ûnd an index j such that AŒj � D x or until every element of A has been checked.

Chapter notes Bollob´ as [65], Hofri [223], and Spencer [420] contain a wealth of advanced prob- abilistic techniques. The advantages of randomized algorithms are discussed and surveyed by Karp [249] and Rabin [372]. The textbook by Motwani and Raghavan [336] gives an extensive treatment of randomized algorithms. The RANDOMLY-PERMUTE procedure is by Durstenfeld [128], based on an ear- lier procedure by Fisher and Yates [143, p. 34]. Several variants of the hiring problem have been widely studied. These problems are more commonly referred to as <secretary problems.= Examples of work in this area are the paper by Ajtai, Meggido, and Waarts [11] and another by Kleinberg [258], which ties the secretary problem to online ad auctions. Part II Sorting and Order Statistics Introduction This part presents several algorithms that solve the following sorting problem: Input: A sequence of n numbers ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i. Output: A permutation (reordering) ha 0 1 ; a 0 2 ; : : : ; a 0 n i of the input sequence such that a 0 1 හ a 0 2 හ    හ a 0 n . The input sequence is usually an n-element array, although it may be represented in some other fashion, such as a linked list. The structure of the data In practice, the numbers to be sorted are rarely isolated values. Each is usually part of a collection of data called a record. Each record contains a key, which is the value to be sorted. The remainder of the record consists of satellite data, which are usually carried around with the key. In practice, when a sorting algorithm permutes the keys, it must permute the satellite data as well. If each record includes a large amount of satellite data, it often pays to permute an array of pointers to the records rather than the records themselves in order to minimize data movement. In a sense, it is these implementation details that distinguish an algorithm from a full-blown program. A sorting algorithm describes the method to determine the sorted order, regardless of whether what’s being sorted are individual numbers or large records containing many bytes of satellite data. Thus, when focusing on the problem of sorting, we typically assume that the input consists only of numbers. Translating an algorithm for sorting numbers into a program for sorting records is conceptually straightforward, although in a given engineering situation other subtleties may make the actual programming task a challenge. 158 Part II Sorting and Order Statistics Why sorting? Many computer scientists consider sorting to be the most fundamental problem in the study of algorithms. There are several reasons:  Sometimes an application inherently needs to sort information. For example, in order to prepare customer statements, banks need to sort checks by check number.  Algorithms often use sorting as a key subroutine. For example, a program that renders graphical objects which are layered on top of each other might have to sort the objects according to an <above= relation so that it can draw these objects from bottom to top. We will see numerous algorithms in this text that use sorting as a subroutine.  We can draw from among a wide variety of sorting algorithms, and they employ a rich set of techniques. In fact, many important techniques used throughout algorithm design appear in sorting algorithms that have been developed over the years. In this way, sorting is also a problem of historical interest.  We can prove a nontrivial lower bound for sorting (as we’ll do in Chapter 8). Since the best upper bounds match the lower bound asymptotically, we can con- clude that certain of our sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal. More- over, we can use the lower bound for sorting to prove lower bounds for various other problems.  Many engineering issues come to the fore when implementing sorting algo- rithms. The fastest sorting program for a particular situation may depend on many factors, such as prior knowledge about the keys and satellite data, the memory hierarchy (caches and virtual memory) of the host computer, and the software environment. Many of these issues are best dealt with at the algorith- mic level, rather than by <tweaking= the code. Sorting algorithms We introduced two algorithms that sort n real numbers in Chapter 2. Insertion sort takes ‚.n 2 / time in the worst case. Because its inner loops are tight, however, it is a fast sorting algorithm for small input sizes. Moreover, unlike merge sort, it sorts in place, meaning that at most a constant number of elements of the input array are ever stored outside the array, which can be advantageous for space efûciency. Merge sort has a better asymptotic running time, ‚.n lg n/, but the MERGE proce- dure it uses does not operate in place. (We’ll see a parallelized version of merge sort in Section 26.3.) Part II Sorting and Order Statistics 159 This part introduces two more algorithms that sort arbitrary real numbers. Heap- sort, presented in Chapter 6, sorts n numbers in place in O.n lg n/ time. It uses an important data structure, called a heap, which can also implement a priority queue. Quicksort, in Chapter 7, also sorts n numbers in place, but its worst-case running time is ‚.n 2 /. Its expected running time is ‚.n lg n/, however, and it generally outperforms heapsort in practice. Like insertion sort, quicksort has tight code, and so the hidden constant factor in its running time is small. It is a popular algorithm for sorting large arrays. Insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort are all comparison sorts: they determine the sorted order of an input array by comparing elements. Chapter 8 be- gins by introducing the decision-tree model in order to study the performance limi- tations of comparison sorts. Using this model, we prove a lower bound of �.n lg n/ on the worst-case running time of any comparison sort on n inputs, thus showing that heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts. Chapter 8 then goes on to show that we might be able to beat this lower bound of �.n lg n/ if an algorithm can gather information about the sorted order of the input by means other than comparing elements. The counting sort algorithm, for example, assumes that the input numbers belong to the set f0; 1; : : : ; kg. By using array indexing as a tool for determining relative order, counting sort can sort n numbers in ‚.k C n/ time. Thus, when k D O.n/, counting sort runs in time that is linear in the size of the input array. A related algorithm, radix sort, can be used to extend the range of counting sort. If there are n integers to sort, each integer has d digits, and each digit can take on up to k possible values, then radix sort can sort the numbers in ‚.d.n C k// time. When d is a constant and k is O.n/, radix sort runs in linear time. A third algorithm, bucket sort, requires knowledge of the probabilistic distribution of numbers in the input array. It can sort n real numbers uniformly distributed in the half-open interval Œ0; 1/ in average-case O.n/ time. The table on the following page summarizes the running times of the sorting al- gorithms from Chapters 2 and 638. As usual, n denotes the number of items to sort. For counting sort, the items to sort are integers in the set f0; 1; : : : ; kg. For radix sort, each item is a d -digit number, where each digit takes on k possible values. For bucket sort, we assume that the keys are real numbers uniformly distributed in the half-open interval Œ0; 1/. The rightmost column gives the average-case or expected running time, indicating which one it gives when it differs from the worst-case run- ning time. We omit the average-case running time of heapsort because we do not analyze it in this book. 160 Part II Sorting and Order Statistics Worst-case Average-case/expected Algorithm running time running time Insertion sort ‚.n 2 / ‚.n 2 / Merge sort ‚.n lg n/ ‚.n lg n/ Heapsort O.n lg n/ 4 Quicksort ‚.n 2 / ‚.n lg n/ (expected) Counting sort ‚.k C n/ ‚.k C n/ Radix sort ‚.d.n C k// ‚.d.n C k// Bucket sort ‚.n 2 / ‚.n/ (average-case) Order statistics The i th order statistic of a set of n numbers is the i th smallest number in the set. You can, of course, select the i th order statistic by sorting the input and indexing the i th element of the output. With no assumptions about the input distribution, this method runs in �.n lg n/ time, as the lower bound proved in Chapter 8 shows. Chapter 9 shows how to ûnd the i th smallest element in O.n/ time, even when the elements are arbitrary real numbers. We present a randomized algorithm with tight pseudocode that runs in ‚.n 2 / time in the worst case, but whose expected running time is O.n/. We also give a more complicated algorithm that runs in O.n/ worst-case time. Background Although most of this part does not rely on difûcult mathematics, some sections do require mathematical sophistication. In particular, analyses of quicksort, bucket sort, and the order-statistic algorithm use probability, which is reviewed in Ap- pendix C, and the material on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms in Chapter 5. 6 Heapsort This chapter introduces another sorting algorithm: heapsort. Like merge sort, but unlike insertion sort, heapsort’s running time is O.n lg n/. Like insertion sort, but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array elements are stored outside the input array at any time. Thus, heapsort combines the better attributes of the two sorting algorithms we have already discussed. Heapsort also introduces another algorithm design technique: using a data struc- ture, in this case one we call a <heap,= to manage information. Not only is the heap data structure useful for heapsort, but it also makes an efûcient priority queue. The heap data structure will reappear in algorithms in later chapters. The term <heap= was originally coined in the context of heapsort, but it has since come to refer to <garbage-collected storage,= such as the programming languages Java and Python provide. Please don’t be confused. The heap data structure is not garbage-collected storage. This book is consistent in using the term <heap= to refer to the data structure, not the storage class. 6.1 Heaps The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree (see Section B.5.3), as shown in Figure 6.1. Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is completely ûlled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is ûlled from the left up to a point. An array AŒ1 W n� that represents a heap is an object with an attribute A: heap-size, which represents how many elements in the heap are stored within array A. That is, although AŒ1 W n� may contain numbers, only the elements in AŒ1 W A: heap-size�, where 0 හ A: heap-size හ n, are valid elements of the heap. If A: heap-size D 0, then the heap is empty. The root of the tree is AŒ1�, and given the index i of a node, 162 Chapter 6 Heapsort (a) 16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1 Figure 6.1 A max-heap viewed as (a) a binary tree and (b) an array. The number within the circle at each node in the tree is the value stored at that node. The number above a node is the corresponding index in the array. Above and below the array are lines showing parent-child relationships, with parents always to the left of their children. The tree has height 3, and the node at index 4 (with value 8) has height 1. there’s a simple way to compute the indices of its parent, left child, and right child with the one-line procedures PARENT, LEFT, and RIGHT. PARENT.i / 1 return bi=2c LEFT.i / 1 return 2i RIGHT.i / 1 return 2i C 1 On most computers, the LEFT procedure can compute 2i in one instruction by simply shifting the binary representation of i left by one bit position. Similarly, the RIGHT procedure can quickly compute 2i C 1 by shifting the binary representation of i left by one bit position and then adding 1. The PARENT procedure can compute bi=2c by shifting i right one bit position. Good implementations of heapsort often implement these procedures as macros or inline procedures. There are two kinds of binary heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In both kinds, the values in the nodes satisfy a heap property, the speciûcs of which depend on the kind of heap. In a max-heap, the max-heap property is that for every node i other than the root, AŒPARENT.i /�  AŒi � ; 6.1 Heaps 163 that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. Thus, the largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself. A min-heap is organized in the opposite way: the min-heap property is that for every node i other than the root, AŒPARENT.i /� හ AŒi � : The smallest element in a min-heap is at the root. The heapsort algorithm uses max-heaps. Min-heaps commonly implement prior- ity queues, which we discuss in Section 6.5. We’ll be precise in specifying whether we need a max-heap or a min-heap for any particular application, and when prop- erties apply to either max-heaps or min-heaps, we just use the term <heap.= Viewing a heap as a tree, we deûne the height of a node in a heap to be the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and we deûne the height of the heap to be the height of its root. Since a heap of n ele- ments is based on a complete binary tree, its height is ‚.lg n/ (see Exercise 6.1-2). As we’ll see, the basic operations on heaps run in time at most proportional to the height of the tree and thus take O.lg n/ time. The remainder of this chapter presents some basic procedures and shows how they are used in a sorting algorithm and a priority-queue data structure.  The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure, which runs in O.lg n/ time, is the key to main- taining the max-heap property.  The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max- heap from an unordered input array.  The HEAPSORT procedure, which runs in O.n lg n/ time, sorts an array in place.  The procedures MAX-HEAP-I NSERT, MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX, MAX- HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY, and MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM allow the heap data structure to implement a priority queue. They run in O.lg n/ time plus the time for mapping between objects being inserted into the priority queue and indices in the heap. Exercises 6.1-1 What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height h? 6.1-2 Show that an n-element heap has height blg nc. 164 Chapter 6 Heapsort 6.1-3 Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree. 6.1-4 Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct? 6.1-5 At which levels in a max-heap might the kth largest element reside, for 2 හ k හ bn=2c, assuming that all elements are distinct? 6.1-6 Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap? 6.1-7 Is the array with values h33; 19; 20; 15; 13; 10; 2; 13; 16; 12i a max-heap? 6.1-8 Show that, with the array representation for storing an n-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by bn=2c C 1; bn=2c C 2; : : : ; n. 6.2 Maintaining the heap property The procedure MAX-HEAPIFY on the facing page maintains the max-heap prop- erty. Its inputs are an array A with the heap-size attribute and an index i into the array. When it is called, MAX-HEAPIFY assumes that the binary trees rooted at LEFT.i / and RIGHT.i / are max-heaps, but that AŒi � might be smaller than its chil- dren, thus violating the max-heap property. MAX-HEAPIFY lets the value at AŒi � <üoat down= in the max-heap so that the subtree rooted at index i obeys the max- heap property. Figure 6.2 illustrates the action of MAX-HEAPIFY. Each step determines the largest of the elements AŒi �, AŒLEFT.i /�, and AŒRIGHT.i /� and stores the index of the largest element in largest . If AŒi � is largest, then the subtree rooted at node i is already a max-heap and nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise, one of the two children contains the largest element. Positions i and largest swap their contents, which causes node i and its children to satisfy the max-heap property. The node in- dexed by largest , however, just had its value decreased, and thus the subtree rooted at largest might violate the max-heap property. Consequently, MAX-HEAPIFY calls itself recursively on that subtree. 6.2 Maintaining the heap property 165 16 4 10 14 7 9 2 8 1 (a) 16 14 10 4 7 9 3 2 8 1 (b) 16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1 (c) 3 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 2 8 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 2 8 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 2 8 i i i Figure 6.2 The action of MAX-HEAPIFY.A; 2/, where A: heap-size D 10.

For a tree rooted at a given node i , the running time is the ‚.1/ time to ûx up the relationships among the elements AŒi �, AŒLEFT.i /�, and AŒRIGHT.i /�, plus the time to run MAX-HEAPIFY on a subtree rooted at one of the children of node i (assuming that the recursive call oc- curs). The children’s subtrees each have size at most 2n=3 (see Exercise 6.2-2), and therefore we can describe the running time of MAX-HEAPIFY by the recurrence T .n/ හ T .2n=3/ C ‚.1/ : (6.1) The solution to this recurrence, by case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1 on page 102), is T .n/ D O.lg n/. Alternatively, we can characterize the running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a node of height h as O.h/. Exercises 6.2-1 Using Figure 6.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAPIFY .A; 3/ on the array A D h27; 17; 3; 16; 13; 10; 1; 5; 7; 12; 4; 8; 9; 0i. 6.2-2 Show that each child of the root of an n-node heap is the root of a subtree containing at most 2n=3 nodes. What is the smallest constant ˛ such that each subtree has at most ˛ n nodes? How does that affect the recurrence (6.1) and its solution? 6.2-3 Starting with the procedure MAX-HEAPIFY, write pseudocode for the procedure MIN-HEAPIFY .A; i /, which performs the corresponding manipulation on a min- heap. How does the running time of MIN-HEAPIFY compare with that of MAX- HEAPIFY? 6.2-4 What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY .A; i / when the element AŒi � is larger than its children? 6.2-5 What is the effect of calling MAX-HEAPIFY .A; i / for i > A: heap-size=2? 6.2-6 The code for MAX-HEAPIFY is quite efûcient in terms of constant factors, except possibly for the recursive call in line 10, for which some compilers might produce inefûcient code. Write an efûcient MAX-HEAPIFY that uses an iterative control construct (a loop) instead of recursion. 6.3 Building a heap 167 6.2-7 Show that the worst-case running time of MAX-HEAPIFY on a heap of size n is �.lg n/. (Hint: For a heap with n nodes, give node values that cause M AX- HEAPIFY to be called recursively at every node on a simple path from the root down to a leaf.) 6.3 Building a heap The procedure BUILD-MAX-HEAP converts an array AŒ1 W n� into a max-heap by calling MAX-HEAPIFY in a bottom-up manner. Exercise 6.1-8 says that the ele- ments in the subarray AŒbn=2c C 1 W n� are all leaves of the tree, and so each is a 1-element heap to begin with. BUILD-MAX-HEAP goes through the remain- ing nodes of the tree and runs MAX-HEAPIFY on each one. Figure 6.3 shows an example of the action of BUILD-MAX-HEAP. BUILD-MAX-HEAP .A; n/ 1 A: heap-size D n 2 for i D bn=2c downto 1 3 MAX-HEAPIFY .A; i / To show why BUILD-MAX-HEAP works correctly, we use the following loop invariant: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 233, each node i C 1; i C 2; : : : ; n is the root of a max-heap. We need to show that this invariant is true prior to the ûrst loop iteration, that each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant, that the loop terminates, and that the invariant provides a useful property to show correctness when the loop terminates. Initialization: Prior to the ûrst iteration of the loop, i D bn=2c. Each node bn=2c C 1; bn=2c C 2; : : : ; n is a leaf and is thus the root of a trivial max-heap. Maintenance: To see that each iteration maintains the loop invariant, observe that the children of node i are numbered higher than i . By the loop invariant, therefore, they are both roots of max-heaps. This is precisely the condition required for the call MAX-HEAPIFY .A; i / to make node i a max-heap root. Moreover, the MAX-HEAPIFY call preserves the property that nodes i C 1; i C 2; : : : ; n are all roots of max-heaps. Decrementing i in the for loop update reestablishes the loop invariant for the next iteration. 168 Chapter 6 Heapsort 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 1 3 2 9 10 14 8 7 (a) 16 4 1 2 3 16 9 10 14 8 7 4 1 3 2 9 10 14 8 7 (b) 16 4 1 3 14 9 10 2 8 7 (c) 16 4 1 10 14 9 3 2 8 7 (d) 16 4 16 10 14 9 3 2 8 1 (e) 7 16 14 10 8 9 3 2 4 1 (f) 7 A i i i i i Figure 6.3 The operation of BUILD-MAX-HEAP, showing the data structure before the call to MAX-HEAPIFY in line 3 of BUILD-MAX-HEAP.

(f) The max-heap after BUILD-MAX-HEAP ûnishes. 6.3 Building a heap 169 Termination: The loop makes exactly bn=2c iterations, and so it terminates. At termination, i D 0. By the loop invariant, each node 1; 2; : : : ; n is the root of a max-heap. In particular, node 1 is. We can compute a simple upper bound on the running time of B UILD-MAX- HEAP as follows. Each call to MAX-HEAPIFY costs O.lg n/ time, and BUILD- MAX-HEAP makes O.n/ such calls. Thus, the running time is O.n lg n/. This upper bound, though correct, is not as tight as it can be. We can derive a tighter asymptotic bound by observing that the time for M AX- HEAPIFY to run at a node varies with the height of the node in the tree, and that the heights of most nodes are small. Our tighter analysis relies on the properties that an n-element heap has height blg nc (see Exercise 6.1-2) and at most Û n=2 hC1  nodes of any height h (see Exercise 6.3-4). The time required by MAX-HEAPIFY when called on a node of height h is O.h/. Letting c be the constant implicit in the asymptotic notation, we can express the total cost of BUILD-MAX-HEAP as being bounded from above by P blg nc hD0 Û n=2 hC1  ch. As Exercise 6.3-2 shows, we have Û n=2 hC1   1=2 for 0 හ h හ blg nc. Since dx e හ 2x for any x  1=2, we have Û n=2 hC1  හ n=2 h .

To build a min-heap, use the procedure BUILD-MIN-HEAP, which is the same as BUILD-MAX-HEAP but with the call to MAX-HEAPIFY in line 3 replaced by a call to MIN-HEAPIFY (see Exercise 6.2-3). BUILD-MIN-HEAP produces a min-heap from an unordered linear array in linear time. 170 Chapter 6 Heapsort Exercises 6.3-1 Using Figure 6.3 as a model, illustrate the operation of BUILD-MAX-HEAP on the array A D h5; 3; 17; 10; 84; 19; 6; 22; 9i. 6.3-2 Show that Û n=2 hC1   1=2 for 0 හ h හ blg nc. 6.3-3 Why does the loop index i in line 2 of BUILD-MAX-HEAP decrease from bn=2c to 1 rather than increase from 1 to bn=2c? 6.3-4 Show that there are at most Û n=2 hC1  nodes of height h in any n-element heap. 6.4 The heapsort algorithm The heapsort algorithm, given by the procedure H EAPSORT, starts by calling the BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure to build a max-heap on the input array AŒ1 W n�. Since the maximum element of the array is stored at the root AŒ1�, HEAPSORT can place it into its correct ûnal position by exchanging it with AŒn�. If the procedure then discards node n from the heap4and it can do so by simply decrementing A: heap-size4the children of the root remain max-heaps, but the new root element might violate the max-heap property. To restore the max-heap property, the pro- cedure just calls MAX-HEAPIFY .A; 1/, which leaves a max-heap in AŒ1 W n  1�. The HEAPSORT procedure then repeats this process for the max-heap of size n  1 down to a heap of size 2. (See Exercise 6.4-2 for a precise loop invariant.)

Exercises 6.4-1 Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of HEAPSORT on the array A D h5; 13; 2; 25; 7; 17; 20; 8; 4i. 6.4-2 Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 235, the subarray AŒ1 W i � is a max-heap containing the i smallest elements of AŒ1 W n�, and the subar- ray AŒi C 1 W n� contains the n  i largest elements of AŒ1 W n�, sorted. 6.4-3 What is the running time of HEAPSORT on an array A of length n that is already sorted in increasing order? How about if the array is already sorted in decreasing order? 6.4-4 Show that the worst-case running time of HEAPSORT is �.n lg n/. ? 6.4-5 Show that when all the elements of A are distinct, the best-case running time of HEAPSORT is �.n lg n/. 6.5 Priority queues In Chapter 8, we will see that any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires �.n lg n/ comparisons and hence �.n lg n/ time. Therefore, heapsort is asymp- totically optimal among comparison-based sorting algorithms. Yet, a good imple- mentation of quicksort, presented in Chapter 7, usually beats it in practice. Never- theless, the heap data structure itself has many uses. In this section, we present one of the most popular applications of a heap: as an efûcient priority queue. As with heaps, priority queues come in two forms: max-priority queues and min-priority queues. We’ll focus here on how to implement max-priority queues, which are in turn based on max-heaps. Exercise 6.5-3 asks you to write the procedures for min-priority queues. 6.5 Priority queues 173 A priority queue is a data structure for maintaining a set S of elements, each with an associated value called a key. A max-priority queue supports the following operations: I NSERT.S; x; k/ inserts the element x with key k into the set S , which is equivalent to the operation S D S [ fx g. MAXIMUM.S/ returns the element of S with the largest key. EXTRACT-MAX.S/ removes and returns the element of S with the largest key. I NCREASE-KEY .S; x; k/ increases the value of element x ’s key to the new value k, which is assumed to be at least as large as x ’s current key value. Among their other applications, you can use max-priority queues to schedule jobs on a computer shared among multiple users. The max-priority queue keeps track of the jobs to be performed and their relative priorities. When a job is ûn- ished or interrupted, the scheduler selects the highest-priority job from among those pending by calling EXTRACT-MAX. The scheduler can add a new job to the queue at any time by calling I NSERT. Alternatively, a min-priority queue supports the operations I NSERT, MINIMUM, EXTRACT-MIN, and DECREASE-KEY. A min-priority queue can be used in an event-driven simulator. The items in the queue are events to be simulated, each with an associated time of occurrence that serves as its key. The events must be simulated in order of their time of occurrence, because the simulation of an event can cause other events to be simulated in the future. The simulation program calls EXTRACT-MIN at each step to choose the next event to simulate. As new events are produced, the simulator inserts them into the min-priority queue by calling I NSERT. We’ll see other uses for min-priority queues, highlighting the DECREASE-KEY operation, in Chapters 21 and 22. When you use a heap to implement a priority queue within a given application, elements of the priority queue correspond to objects in the application. Each ob- ject contains a key. If the priority queue is implemented by a heap, you need to determine which application object corresponds to a given heap element, and vice versa. Because the heap elements are stored in an array, you need a way to map application objects to and from array indices. One way to map between application objects and heap elements uses handles, which are additional information stored in the objects and heap elements that give enough information to perform the mapping. Handles are often implemented to be opaque to the surrounding code, thereby maintaining an abstraction barrier be- tween the application and the priority queue. For example, the handle within an application object might contain the corresponding index into the heap array. But since only the code for the priority queue accesses this index, the index is entirely hidden from the application code. Because heap elements change locations within 174 Chapter 6 Heapsort the array during heap operations, an actual implementation of the priority queue, upon relocating a heap element, must also update the array indices in the corre- sponding handles. Conversely, each element in the heap might contain a pointer to the corresponding application object, but the heap element knows this pointer as only an opaque handle and the application maps this handle to an application object. Typically, the worst-case overhead for maintaining handles is O.1/ per access. As an alternative to incorporating handles in application objects, you can store within the priority queue a mapping from application objects to array indices in the heap. The advantage of doing so is that the mapping is contained entirely within the priority queue, so that the application objects need no further embellishment. The disadvantage lies in the additional cost of establishing and maintaining the mapping. One option for the mapping is a hash table (see Chapter 11). 1 The added expected time for a hash table to map an object to an array index is just O.1/, though the worst-case time can be as bad as ‚.n/. Let’s see how to implement the operations of a max-priority queue using a max- heap. In the previous sections, we treated the array elements as the keys to be sorted, implicitly assuming that any satellite data moved with the corresponding keys. When a heap implements a priority queue, we instead treat each array ele- ment as a pointer to an object in the priority queue, so that the object is analogous to the satellite data when sorting. We further assume that each such object has an attribute key, which determines where in the heap the object belongs. For a heap implemented by an array A, we refer to AŒi �: key. The procedure MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM on the facing page implements the MAXIMUM operation in ‚.1/ time, and MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX implements the operation EXTRACT-MAX. MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX is similar to the for loop body (lines 335) of the HEAPSORT procedure. We implicitly assume that MAX-HEAPIFY compares priority-queue objects based on their key attributes. We also assume that when MAX-HEAPIFY exchanges elements in the array, it is ex- changing pointers and also that it updates the mapping between objects and ar- ray indices. The running time of MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX is O.lg n/, since it performs only a constant amount of work on top of the O.lg n/ time for MAX-HEAPIFY , plus whatever overhead is incurred within MAX-HEAPIFY for mapping priority-queue objects to array indices. The procedure MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY on page 176 implements the I NCREASE-KEY operation. It ûrst veriûes that the new key k will not cause the key in the object x to decrease, and if there is no problem, it gives x the new key value. The procedure then ûnds the index i in the array corresponding to object x , 1 In Python, dictionaries are implemented with hash tables. 6.5 Priority queues 175 MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM.A/ 1 if A: heap-size < 1 2 error <heap underüow= 3 return AŒ1� MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX .A/ 1 max D MAX-HEAP-MAXIMUM.A/ 2 AŒ1� D AŒA: heap-size� 3 A: heap-size D A: heap-size  1 4 MAX-HEAPIFY .A; 1/ 5 return max so that AŒi � is x . Because increasing the key of AŒi � might violate the max-heap property, the procedure then, in a manner reminiscent of the insertion loop (lines 537) of I NSERTION-SORT on page 19, traverses a simple path from this node to- ward the root to ûnd a proper place for the newly increased key . As MAX-HEAP- I NCREASE-KEY traverses this path, it repeatedly compares an element’s key to that of its parent, exchanging pointers and continuing if the element’s key is larger, and terminating if the element’s key is smaller, since the max-heap property now holds. (See Exercise 6.5-7 for a precise loop invariant.) Like MAX-HEAPIFY when used in a priority queue, MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY updates the information that maps objects to array indices when array elements are exchanged. Figure 6.5 shows an example of a MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY operation. In addition to the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices, the running time of MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY on an n-element heap is O.lg n/, since the path traced from the node updated in line 3 to the root has length O.lg n/. The procedure MAX-HEAP-I NSERT on the next page implements the I NSERT operation. It takes as inputs the array A implementing the max-heap, the new object x to be inserted into the max-heap, and the size n of array A. The procedure ûrst veriûes that the array has room for the new element. It then expands the max-heap by adding to the tree a new leaf whose key is 1. Then it calls MAX- HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY to set the key of this new element to its correct value and maintain the max-heap property. The running time of MAX-HEAP-I NSERT on an n-element heap is O.lg n/ plus the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to indices. In summary, a heap can support any priority-queue operation on a set of size n in O.lg n/ time, plus the overhead for mapping priority queue objects to array indices. 176 Chapter 6 Heapsort MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY .A; x; k/ 1 if k < x: key 2 error <new key is smaller than current key= 3 x: key D k 4 ûnd the index i in array A where object x occurs 5 while i > 1 and AŒPARENT.i /�: key < AŒi �: key 6 exchange AŒi � with AŒPARENT.i /�, updating the information that maps priority queue objects to array indices 7 i D PARENT.i / MAX-HEAP-I NSERT .A; x; n/ 1 if A: heap-size == n 2 error <heap overüow= 3 A: heap-size D A: heap-size C 1 4 k D x: key 5 x: key D 1 6 AŒA: heap-size� D x 7 map x to index heap-size in the array 8 MAX-HEAP-I NCREASE-KEY .A; x; k/ Exercises 6.5-1 Suppose that the objects in a max-priority queue are just keys.

Chapter notes The heapsort algorithm was invented by Williams [456], who also described how to implement a priority queue with a heap. The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure was suggested by Floyd [145]. Schaffer and Sedgewick [395] showed that in the best case, the number of times elements move in the heap during heapsort is approxi- mately .n=2/ lg n and that the average number of moves is approximately n lg n. We use min-heaps to implement min-priority queues in Chapters 15, 21, and 22. Other, more complicated, data structures give better time bounds for certain min- priority queue operations. Fredman and Tarjan [156] developed Fibonacci heaps, which support I NSERT and DECREASE-KEY in O.1/ amortized time (see Chap- ter 16). That is, the average worst-case running time for these operations is O.1/. Brodal, Lagogiannis, and Tarjan [73] subsequently devised strict Fibonacci heaps, which make these time bounds the actual running times. If the keys are unique and drawn from the set f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g of nonnegative integers, van Emde Boas trees [440, 441] support the operations I NSERT, DELETE, SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, PREDECESSOR, and SUCCESSOR in O.lg lg n/ time. If the data are b-bit integers, and the computer memory consists of addressable b-bit words, Fredman and Willard [157] showed how to implement MINIMUM in O.1/ time and I NSERT and EXTRACT-MIN in O. p lg n/ time. Thorup [436] has Notes for Chapter 6 181 improved the O. p lg n/ bound to O.lg lg n/ time by using randomized hashing, requiring only linear space. An important special case of priority queues occurs when the sequence of EXTRACT-MIN operations is monotone, that is, the values returned by succes- sive EXTRACT-MIN operations are monotonically increasing over time. This case arises in several important applications, such as Dijkstra’s single-source shortest- paths algorithm, which we discuss in Chapter 22, and in discrete-event simula- tion. For Dijkstra’s algorithm it is particularly important that the DECREASE-KEY operation be implemented efûciently. For the monotone case, if the data are in- tegers in the range 1; 2; : : : ; C , Ahuja, Mehlhorn, Orlin, and Tarjan [8] describe how to implement EXTRACT-MIN and I NSERT in O.lg C / amortized time (Chap- ter 16 presents amortized analysis) and D ECREASE-KEY in O.1/ time, using a data structure called a radix heap. The O.lg C / bound can be improved to O. p lg C / using Fibonacci heaps in conjunction with radix heaps. Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Silverstein [90] further improved the bound to O.lg 1=3C C / expected time by combining the multilevel bucketing structure of Denardo and Fox [112] with the heap of Thorup mentioned earlier. Raman [375] further improved these results to obtain a bound of O ã min ˚ lg 1=4C C; lg 1=3C n ä , for any ûxed � > 0. Many other variants of heaps have been proposed. Brodal [72] surveys some of these developments. 7 Quicksort The quicksort algorithm has a worst-case running time of ‚.n 2 / on an input array of n numbers. Despite this slow worst-case running time, quicksort is often the best practical choice for sorting because it is remarkably efûcient on average: its expected running time is ‚.n lg n/ when all numbers are distinct, and the constant factors hidden in the ‚.n lg n/ notation are small. Unlike merge sort, it also has the advantage of sorting in place (see page 158), and it works well even in virtual- memory environments. Our study of quicksort is broken into four sections. Section 7.1 describes the algorithm and an important subroutine used by quicksort for partitioning. Because the behavior of quicksort is complex, we’ll start with an intuitive discussion of its performance in Section 7.2 and analyze it precisely at the end of the chapter. Section 7.3 presents a randomized version of quicksort. When all elements are distinct, 1 this randomized algorithm has a good expected running time and no par- ticular input elicits its worst-case behavior. (See Problem 7-2 for the case in which elements may be equal.) Section 7.4 analyzes the randomized algorithm, showing that it runs in ‚.n 2 / time in the worst case and, assuming distinct elements, in expected O.n lg n/ time. 1 You can enforce the assumption that the values in an array A are distinct at the cost of ‚.n/ additional space and only constant overhead in running time by converting each input value AŒi� to an ordered pair .AŒi�; i/ with .AŒi�; i/ < .AŒj �; j / if AŒi� < AŒj � or if AŒi� D AŒj � and i < j . There are also more practical variants of quicksort that work well when elements are not distinct. 7.1 Description of quicksort 183 7.1 Description of quicksort Quicksort, like merge sort, applies the divide-and-conquer method introduced in Section 2.3.1. Here is the three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting a sub- array AŒp W r�: Divide by partitioning (rearranging) the array AŒp W r� into two (possibly empty) subarrays AŒp W q  1� (the low side) and AŒq C 1 W r� (the high side) such that each element in the low side of the partition is less than or equal to the pivot AŒq�, which is, in turn, less than or equal to each element in the high side. Compute the index q of the pivot as part of this partitioning procedure. Conquer by calling quicksort recursively to sort each of the subarrays AŒp W q  1� and AŒq C 1 W r�. Combine by doing nothing: because the two subarrays are already sorted, no work is needed to combine them. All elements in AŒp W q  1� are sorted and less than or equal to AŒq�, and all elements in AŒq C 1 W r� are sorted and greater than or equal to the pivot AŒq�. The entire subarray AŒp W r� cannot help but be sorted! The QUICKSORT procedure implements quicksort. To sort an entire n-element array AŒ1 W n�, the initial call is QUICKSORT.A; 1; n/. QUICKSORT.A; p; r/ 1 if p < r 2 // Partition the subarray around the pivot, which ends up in AŒq�. 3 q D PARTITION.A; p; r/ 4 QUICKSORT.A; p; q  1/ // recursively sort the low side 5 QUICKSORT.A; q C 1; r/ // recursively sort the high side Partitioning the array The key to the algorithm is the PARTITION procedure on the next page, which rearranges the subarray AŒp W r� in place, returning the index of the dividing point between the two sides of the partition. Figure 7.1 shows how PARTITION works on an 8-element array. PARTITION always selects the element x D AŒr� as the pivot. As the procedure runs, each element falls into exactly one of four regions, some of which may be empty. At the start of each iteration of the for loop in lines 336, the regions satisfy certain properties, shown in Figure 7.2. We state these properties as a loop invariant: 184 Chapter 7 Quicksort PARTITION.A; p; r/ 1 x D AŒr� // the pivot 2 i D p  1 // highest index into the low side 3 for j D p to r  1 // process each element other than the pivot 4 if AŒj � හ x // does this element belong on the low side? 5 i D i C 1 // index of a new slot in the low side 6 exchange AŒi � with AŒj � // put this element there 7 exchange AŒi C 1� with AŒr� // pivot goes just to the right of the low side 8 return i C 1 // new index of the pivot At the beginning of each iteration of the loop of lines 336, for any array index k, the following conditions hold: 1. if p හ k හ i , then AŒk� හ x (the tan region of Figure 7.2); 2. if i C 1 හ k හ j  1, then AŒk� > x (the blue region); 3. if k D r , then AŒk� D x (the yellow region). We need to show that this loop invariant is true prior to the ûrst iteration, that each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant, that the loop terminates, and that correctness follows from the invariant when the loop terminates. Initialization: Prior to the ûrst iteration of the loop, we have i D p  1 and j D p. Because no values lie between p and i and no values lie between i C 1 and j  1, the ûrst two conditions of the loop invariant are trivially satisûed. The assignment in line 1 satisûes the third condition. Maintenance: As Figure 7.3 shows, we consider two cases, depending on the outcome of the test in line 4. Figure 7.3(a) shows what happens when AŒj � > x: the only action in the loop is to increment j . After j has been incremented, the second condition holds for AŒj  1� and all other entries remain unchanged. Figure 7.3(b) shows what happens when AŒj � හ x : the loop increments i , swaps AŒi � and AŒj �, and then increments j . Because of the swap, we now have that AŒi � හ x , and condition 1 is satisûed. Similarly, we also have that AŒj  1� > x , since the item that was swapped into AŒj  1� is, by the loop invariant, greater than x . Termination: Since the loop makes exactly r  p iterations, it terminates, where- upon j D r . At that point, the unexamined subarray AŒj W r  1� is empty, and every entry in the array belongs to one of the other three sets described by the invariant. Thus, the values in the array have been partitioned into three sets: those less than or equal to x (the low side), those greater than x (the high side), and a singleton set containing x (the pivot). 7.1 Description of quicksort 185 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p,j r i (a) 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p,i r j (b) 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p,i r j (c) 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p,i r j (d) 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p r j (e) i 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p r j (f) i 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p r j (g) i 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p r (h) i 2 8 7 1 3 5 6 4 p r (i) i Figure 7.1 The operation of PARTITION on a sample array. Array entry AŒr� becomes the pivot element x. Tan array elements all belong to the low side of the partition, with values at most x. Blue elements belong to the high side, with values greater than x. White elements have not yet been put into either side of the partition, and the yellow element is the pivot x. (a) The initial array and variable settings. None of the elements have been placed into either side of the partition. (b) The value 2 is <swapped with itself= and put into the low side. (c)–(d) The values 8 and 7 are placed into to high side. (e) The values 1 and 8 are swapped, and the low side grows. (f) The values 3 and 7 are swapped, and the low side grows. (g)–(h) The high side of the partition grows to include 5 and 6, and the loop terminates. (i) Line 7 swaps the pivot element so that it lies between the two sides of the partition, and line 8 returns the pivot’s new index. The ûnal two lines of PARTITION ûnish up by swapping the pivot with the left- most element greater than x , thereby moving the pivot into its correct place in the partitioned array, and then returning the pivot’s new index. The output of PARTITION now satisûes the speciûcations given for the divide step. In fact, it satisûes a slightly stronger condition: after line 3 of QUICKSORT, AŒq� is strictly less than every element of AŒq C 1 W r�. 186 Chapter 7 Quicksort ≤ x > x unknown x p i j r Figure 7.2 The four regions maintained by the procedure PARTITION on a subarray AŒp W r�. The tan values in AŒp W i� are all less than or equal to x, the blue values in AŒi C 1 W j  1� are all greater than x, the white values in AŒj W r  1� have unknown relationships to x, and AŒr� D x. ≤ x > x x p i j r > x (a) ≤ x > x x p i j r ≤ x > x x p i j r ≤ x (b) ≤ x > x x p i j r Figure 7.3 The two cases for one iteration of procedure PARTITION. (a) If AŒj � > x , the only action is to increment j , which maintains the loop invariant. (b) If AŒj � හ x, index i is incremented, AŒi� and AŒj � are swapped, and then j is incremented. Again, the loop invariant is maintained. Exercise 7.1-3 asks you to show that the running time of PARTITION on a sub- array AŒp W r� of n D r  p C 1 elements is ‚.n/. Exercises 7.1-1 Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A D h13; 19; 9; 5; 12; 8; 7; 4; 21; 2; 6; 11i. 7.2 Performance of quicksort 187 7.1-2 What value of q does PARTITION return when all elements in the subarray AŒp W r� have the same value? Modify PARTITION so that q D b.p C r/=2c when all elements in the subarray AŒp W r� have the same value. 7.1-3 Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n is ‚.n/. 7.1-4 Modify QUICKSORT to sort into monotonically decreasing order. 7.2 Performance of quicksort The running time of quicksort depends on how balanced each partitioning is, which in turn depends on which elements are used as pivots. If the two sides of a parti- tion are about the same size4the partitioning is balanced4then the algorithm runs asymptotically as fast as merge sort. If the partitioning is unbalanced, however, it can run asymptotically as slowly as insertion sort. To allow you to gain some intu- ition before diving into a formal analysis, this section informally investigates how quicksort performs under the assumptions of balanced versus unbalanced partition- ing. But ûrst, let’s brieüy look at the maximum amount of memory that quicksort re- quires. Although quicksort sorts in place according to the deûnition on page 158, the amount of memory it uses4aside from the array being sorted4is not constant. Since each recursive call requires a constant amount of space on the runtime stack, outside of the array being sorted, quicksort requires space proportional to the max- imum depth of the recursion. As we’ll see now, that could be as bad as ‚.n/ in the worst case. Worst-case partitioning The worst-case behavior for quicksort occurs when the partitioning produces one subproblem with n  1 elements and one with 0 elements. (See Section 7.4.1.) Let us assume that this unbalanced partitioning arises in each recursive call. The partitioning costs ‚.n/ time. Since the recursive call on an array of size 0 just returns without doing anything, T .0/ D ‚.1/, and the recurrence for the running time is 188 Chapter 7 Quicksort T .n/ D T .n  1/ C T .0/ C ‚.n/ D T .n  1/ C ‚.n/ : By summing the costs incurred at each level of the recursion, we obtain an arithmetic series (equation (A.3) on page 1141), which evaluates to ‚.n 2 /. In- deed, the substitution method can be used to prove that the recurrence T .n/ D T .n  1/ C ‚.n/ has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n 2 /. (See Exercise 7.2-1.) Thus, if the partitioning is maximally unbalanced at every recursive level of the algorithm, the running time is ‚.n 2 /. The worst-case running time of quicksort is therefore no better than that of insertion sort. Moreover, the ‚.n 2 / running time occurs when the input array is already completely sorted4a situation in which insertion sort runs in O.n/ time. Best-case partitioning In the most even possible split, PARTITION produces two subproblems, each of size no more than n=2, since one is of size b.n  1/=2c හ n=2 and one of size d.n  1/=2e  1 හ n=2. In this case, quicksort runs much faster. An upper bound on the running time can then be described by the recurrence T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ : By case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1 on page 102), this recurrence has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. Thus, if the partitioning is equally balanced at every level of the recursion, an asymptotically faster algorithm results. Balanced partitioning As the analyses in Section 7.4 will show, the average-case running time of quicksort is much closer to the best case than to the worst case. By appreciating how the balance of the partitioning affects the recurrence describing the running time, we can gain an understanding of why. Suppose, for example, that the partitioning algorithm always produces a 9-to-1 proportional split, which at ûrst blush seems quite unbalanced. We then obtain the recurrence T .n/ D T .9n=10/ C T .n=10/ C ‚.n/ ; on the running time of quicksort. Figure 7.4 shows the recursion tree for this re- currence, where for simplicity the ‚.n/ driving function has been replaced by n, which won’t affect the asymptotic solution of the recurrence (as Exercise 4.7-1 on page 118 justiûes). Every level of the tree has cost n, until the recursion bot- toms out in a base case at depth log 10 n D ‚.lg n/, and then the levels have cost 7.2 Performance of quicksort 189 n n n n n හ n හ n 1 1 O.n lg n/ log 10 n log 10=9 n 1 10 n 9 10 n 1 100 n 9 100 n 9 100 n 81 100 n 81 1000 n 729 1000 n Figure 7.4 A recursion tree for QUICKSORT in which PARTITION always produces a 9-to-1 split, yielding a running time of O.n lg n/. Nodes show subproblem sizes, with per-level costs on the right. at most n. The recursion terminates at depth log 10=9 n D ‚.lg n/. Thus, with a 9-to-1 proportional split at every level of recursion, which intuitively seems highly unbalanced, quicksort runs in O.n lg n/ time4asymptotically the same as if the split were right down the middle. Indeed, even a 99-to-1 split yields an O.n lg n/ running time. In fact, any split of constant proportionality yields a recursion tree of depth ‚.lg n/, where the cost at each level is O.n/. The running time is therefore O.n lg n/ whenever the split has constant proportionality. The ratio of the split affects only the constant hidden in the O-notation. Intuition for the average case To develop a clear notion of the expected behavior of quicksort, we must assume something about how its inputs are distributed. Because quicksort determines the sorted order using only comparisons between input elements, its behavior depends on the relative ordering of the values in the array elements given as the input, not on the particular values in the array. As in the probabilistic analysis of the hiring problem in Section 5.2, assume that all permutations of the input numbers are equally likely and that the elements are distinct. When quicksort runs on a random input array, the partitioning is highly unlikely to happen in the same way at every level, as our informal analysis has assumed. 190 Chapter 7 Quicksort n 0 n31 (n31)/2 3 1 (n31)/2 n (n31)/2 (a) (b) (n31)/2 Θ(n) Θ(n) Figure 7.5 (a) Two levels of a recursion tree for quicksort. The partitioning at the root costs n and produces a <bad= split: two subarrays of sizes 0 and n  1. The partitioning of the subarray of size n  1 costs n  1 and produces a <good= split: subarrays of size .n  1/=2  1 and .n  1/=2. (b) A single level of a recursion tree that is well balanced. In both parts, the partitioning cost for the subproblems shown with blue shading is ‚.n/. Yet the subproblems remaining to be solved in (a), shown with tan shading, are no larger than the corresponding subproblems remaining to be solved in (b). We expect that some of the splits will be reasonably well balanced and that some will be fairly unbalanced. For example, Exercise 7.2-6 asks you to show that about 80% of the time PARTITION produces a split that is at least as balanced as 9 to 1, and about 20% of the time it produces a split that is less balanced than 9 to 1. In the average case, PARTITION produces a mix of <good= and <bad= splits. In a recursion tree for an average-case execution of PARTITION, the good and bad splits are distributed randomly throughout the tree. Suppose for the sake of intuition that the good and bad splits alternate levels in the tree, and that the good splits are best- case splits and the bad splits are worst-case splits. Figure 7.5(a) shows the splits at two consecutive levels in the recursion tree. At the root of the tree, the cost is n for partitioning, and the subarrays produced have sizes n  1 and 0: the worst case. At the next level, the subarray of size n  1 undergoes best-case partitioning into subarrays of size .n  1/=2  1 and .n  1/=2. Let’s assume that the base-case cost is 1 for the subarray of size 0. The combination of the bad split followed by the good split produces three sub- arrays of sizes 0, .n  1/=2  1, and .n  1/=2 at a combined partitioning cost of ‚.n/ C ‚.n  1/ D ‚.n/. This situation is at most a constant factor worse than that in Figure 7.5(b), namely, where a single level of partitioning produces two subarrays of size .n  1/=2, at a cost of ‚.n/. Yet this latter situation is balanced! Intuitively, the ‚.n  1/ cost of the bad split in Figure 7.5(a) can be absorbed into the ‚.n/ cost of the good split, and the resulting split is good. Thus, the run- ning time of quicksort, when levels alternate between good and bad splits, is like the running time for good splits alone: still O.n lg n/, but with a slightly larger constant hidden by the O-notation. We’ll analyze the expected running time of a randomized version of quicksort rigorously in Section 7.4.2. 7.3 A randomized version of quicksort 191 Exercises 7.2-1 Use the substitution method to prove that the recurrence T .n/ D T .n  1/ C ‚.n/ has the solution T .n/ D ‚.n 2 /, as claimed at the beginning of Section 7.2. 7.2-2 What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array A have the same value? 7.2-3 Show that the running time of QUICKSORT is ‚.n 2 / when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order. 7.2-4 Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the trans- actions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in order by check num- ber, and merchants usually cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Explain persuasively why the procedure I NSERTION-SORT might tend to beat the procedure QUICKSORT on this problem. 7.2-5 Suppose that the splits at every level of quicksort are in the constant proportion ˛ to ˇ, where ˛ C ˇ D 1 and 0 < ˛ හ ˇ < 1. Show that the minimum depth of a leaf in the recursion tree is approximately log 1=˛ n and that the maximum depth is approximately log 1=ˇ n. (Don’t worry about integer round-off.) 7.2-6 Consider an array with distinct elements and for which all permutations of the ele- ments are equally likely. Argue that for any constant 0 < ˛ හ 1=2, the probability is approximately 1  2˛ that PARTITION produces a split at least as balanced as 1  ˛ to ˛. 7.3 A randomized version of quicksort In exploring the average-case behavior of quicksort, we have assumed that all per- mutations of the input numbers are equally likely. This assumption does not al- ways hold, however, as, for example, in the situation laid out in the premise for 192 Chapter 7 Quicksort Exercise 7.2-4. Section 5.3 showed that judicious randomization can sometimes be added to an algorithm to obtain good expected performance over all inputs. For quicksort, randomization yields a fast and practical algorithm. Many software li- braries provide a randomized version of quicksort as their algorithm of choice for sorting large data sets. In Section 5.3, the RANDOMIZED-HIRE-ASSISTANT procedure explicitly per- mutes its input and then runs the deterministic HIRE-ASSISTANT procedure. We could do the same for quicksort as well, but a different randomization technique yields a simpler analysis. Instead of always using AŒr� as the pivot, a randomized version randomly chooses the pivot from the subarray AŒp W r�, where each element in AŒp W r� has an equal probability of being chosen. It then exchanges that element with AŒr� before partitioning. Because the pivot is chosen randomly, we expect the split of the input array to be reasonably well balanced on average. The changes to PARTITION and QUICKSORT are small. The new partition- ing procedure, RANDOMIZED-PARTITION, simply swaps before performing the partitioning. The new quicksort procedure, RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, calls RANDOMIZED-PARTITION instead of PARTITION. We’ll analyze this algorithm in the next section. RANDOMIZED-PARTITION .A; p; r/ 1 i D RANDOM.p; r/ 2 exchange AŒr� with AŒi � 3 return PARTITION.A; p; r/ RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT .A; p; r/ 1 if p < r 2 q D RANDOMIZED-PARTITION .A; p; r/ 3 RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT .A; p; q  1/ 4 RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT .A; q C 1; r/ Exercises 7.3-1 Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case running time? 7.4 Analysis of quicksort 193 7.3-2 When RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT runs, how many calls are made to the random- number generator RANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of ‚-notation. 7.4 Analysis of quicksort Section 7.2 gave some intuition for the worst-case behavior of quicksort and for why we expect the algorithm to run quickly. This section analyzes the behavior of quicksort more rigorously. We begin with a worst-case analysis, which applies to either QUICKSORT or RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, and conclude with an analysis of the expected running time of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT. 7.4.1 Worst-case analysis We saw in Section 7.2 that a worst-case split at every level of recursion in quicksort produces a ‚.n 2 / running time, which, intuitively, is the worst-case running time of the algorithm. We now prove this assertion. We’ll use the substitution method (see Section 4.3) to show that the running time of quicksort is O.n 2 /. Let T .n/ be the worst-case time for the procedure QUICKSORT on an input of size n. Because the procedure PARTITION produces two subproblems with total size n  1, we obtain the recurrence T .n/ D max fT .q/ C T .n  1  q/ W 0 හ q හ n  1g C ‚.n/ ; (7.1) We guess that T .n/ හ cn 2 for some constant c > 0. Substituting this guess into recurrence (7.1) yields T .n/ හ max ˚ cq 2 C c.n  1  q/ 2 W 0 හ q හ n  1  C ‚.n/ D c  max ˚ q 2 C .n  1  q/ 2 W 0 හ q හ n  1  C ‚.n/ : Let’s focus our attention on the maximization. For q D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, we have q 2 C .n  1  q/ 2 D q 2 C .n  1/ 2  2q.n  1/ C q 2 D .n  1/ 2 C 2q.q  .n  1// හ .n  1/ 2 because q හ n  1 implies that 2q.q  .n  1// හ 0. Thus every term in the maximization is bounded by .n  1/ 2 . Continuing with our analysis of T .n/, we obtain 194 Chapter 7 Quicksort T .n/ හ c.n  1/ 2 C ‚.n/ හ cn 2  c.2n  1/ C ‚.n/ හ cn 2 ; by picking the constant c large enough that the c.2n  1/ term dominates the ‚.n/ term. Thus T .n/ D O.n 2 /. Section 7.2 showed a speciûc case where quicksort takes �.n 2 / time: when partitioning is maximally unbalanced. Thus, the worst- case running time of quicksort is ‚.n 2 /. 7.4.2 Expected running time We have already seen the intuition behind why the expected running time of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT is O.n lg n/: if, in each level of recursion, the split induced by RANDOMIZED-PARTITION puts any constant fraction of the elements on one side of the partition, then the recursion tree has depth ‚.lg n/ and O.n/ work is performed at each level. Even if we add a few new levels with the most un- balanced split possible between these levels, the total time remains O.n lg n/. We can analyze the expected running time of R ANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT precisely by ûrst understanding how the partitioning procedure operates and then using this understanding to derive an O.n lg n/ bound on the expected running time. This upper bound on the expected running time, combined with the ‚.n lg n/ best-case bound we saw in Section 7.2, yields a ‚.n lg n/ expected running time. We assume throughout that the values of the elements being sorted are distinct. Running time and comparisons The QUICKSORT and RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT procedures differ only in how they select pivot elements. They are the same in all other respects. We can there- fore analyze RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT by considering the QUICKSORT and PARTITION procedures, but with the assumption that pivot elements are selected randomly from the subarray passed to RANDOMIZED-PARTITION. Let’s start by relating the asymptotic running time of QUICKSORT to the number of times ele- ments are compared (all in line 4 of PARTITION), understanding that this analysis also applies to RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT. Note that we are counting the number of times that array elements are compared, not comparisons of indices. Lemma 7.1 The running time of QUICKSORT on an n-element array is O.n C X /, where X is the number of element comparisons performed. 7.4 Analysis of quicksort 195 Proof The running time of QUICKSORT is dominated by the time spent in the PARTITION procedure. Each time PARTITION is called, it selects a pivot ele- ment, which is never included in any future recursive calls to QUICKSORT and PARTITION. Thus, there can be at most n calls to PARTITION over the entire ex- ecution of the quicksort algorithm. Each time QUICKSORT calls PARTITION, it also recursively calls itself twice, so there are at most 2n calls to the QUICKSORT procedure itself. One call to PARTITION takes O.1/ time plus an amount of time that is propor- tional to the number of iterations of the for loop in lines 336. Each iteration of this for loop performs one comparison in line 4, comparing the pivot element to an- other element of the array A. Therefore, the total time spent in the for loop across all executions is proportional to X . Since there are at most n calls to PARTITION and the time spent outside the for loop is O.1/ for each call, the total time spent in PARTITION outside of the for loop is O.n/. Thus the total time for quicksort is O.n C X /. Our goal for analyzing RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, therefore, is to compute the expected value E ŒX � of the random variable X denoting the total number of comparisons performed in all calls to PARTITION. To do so, we must understand when the quicksort algorithm compares two elements of the array and when it does not. For ease of analysis, let’s index the elements of the array A by their position in the sorted output, rather than their position in the input. That is, although the elements in A may start out in any order, we’ll refer to them by ´ 1 ; ´ 2 ; : : : ; ´ n , where ´ 1 < ´ 2 <    < ´ n , with strict inequality because we assume that all elements are distinct. We denote the set f´ i ; ´ i C1 ; : : : ; ´ j g by Z ij . The next lemma characterizes when two elements are compared. Lemma 7.2 During the execution of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT on an array of n distinct ele- ments ´ 1 < ´ 2 <    < ´ n , an element ´ i is compared with an element ´ j , where i < j , if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any other element in the set Z ij . Moreover, no two elements are ever compared twice. Proof Let’s look at the ûrst time that an element x 2 Z ij is chosen as a pivot during the execution of the algorithm. There are three cases to consider. If x is neither ´ i nor ´ j 4that is, ´ i < x < ´ j 4then ´ i and ´ j are not compared at any subsequent time, because they fall into different sides of the partition around x . If x D ´ i , then PARTITION compares ´ i with every other item in Z ij . Similarly, if x D ´ j , then PARTITION compares ´ j with every other item in Z ij . Thus, ´ i and ´ j are compared if and only if the ûrst element to be chosen as a pivot from Z ij is either ´ i or ´ j . In the latter two cases, where one of ´ i and ´ j is chosen 196 Chapter 7 Quicksort as a pivot, since the pivot is removed from future comparisons, it is never compared again with the other element. As an example of this lemma, consider an input to quicksort of the numbers 1 through 10 in some arbitrary order. Suppose that the ûrst pivot element is 7. Then the ûrst call to PARTITION separates the numbers into two sets: f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g and f8; 9; 10g. In the process, the pivot element 7 is compared with all other elements, but no number from the ûrst set (e.g., 2) is or ever will be compared with any number from the second set (e.g., 9). The values 7 and 9 are compared because 7 is the ûrst item from Z 7;9 to be chosen as a pivot. In contrast, 2 and 9 are never compared because the ûrst pivot element chosen from Z 2;9 is 7. The next lemma gives the probability that two elements are compared. Lemma 7.3 Consider an execution of the procedure R ANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT on an array of n distinct elements ´ 1 < ´ 2 <    < ´ n . Given two arbitrary elements ´ i and ´ j where i < j , the probability that they are compared is 2=.j  i C 1/. Proof Let’s look at the tree of recursive calls that RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT makes, and consider the sets of elements provided as input to each call. Initially, the root set contains all the elements of Z ij , since the root set contains every element in A. The elements belonging to Z ij all stay together for each recursive call of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT until PARTITION chooses some element x 2 Z ij as a pivot. From that point on, the pivot x appears in no subsequent input set. The ûrst time that RANDOMIZED-SELECT chooses a pivot x 2 Z ij from a set containing all the elements of Z ij , each element in Z ij is equally likely to be x because the pivot is chosen uniformly at random. Since jZ ij j D j  i C 1, the probability is 1=.j  i C 1/ that any given element in Z ij is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij . Thus, by Lemma 7.2, we have Pr f´ i is compared with ´ j g D Pr f´ i or ´ j is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g D Pr f´ i is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g C Pr f´ j is the ûrst pivot chosen from Z ij g D 2 j  i C 1 ; where the second line follows from the ûrst because the two events are mutually exclusive. We can now complete the analysis of randomized quicksort. 7.4 Analysis of quicksort 197 Theorem 7.4 The expected running time of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT on an input of n distinct elements is O.n lg n/. Proof The analysis uses indicator random variables (see Section 5.2). Let the n distinct elements be ´ 1 < ´ 2 <    < ´ n , and for 1 හ i < j හ n, deûne the indicator random variable X ij D I f´ i is compared with ´ j g. From Lemma 7.2, each pair is compared at most once, and so we can express X as follows: X D n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 X ij : By taking expectations of both sides and using linearity of expectation (equa- tion (C.24) on page 1192) and Lemma 5.1 on page 130, we obtain E ŒX � D E \" n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 X ij # D n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 E ŒX ij � (by linearity of expectation) D n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 Pr f´ i is compared with ´ j g (by Lemma 5.1) D n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 2 j  i C 1 (by Lemma 7.3) . We can evaluate this sum using a change of variables (k D j  i ) and the bound on the harmonic series in equation (A.9) on page 1142: E ŒX � D n1 X i D1 n X j Di C1 2 j  i C 1 D n1 X i D1 ni X kD1 2 k C 1 < n1 X i D1 n X kD1 2 k D n1 X i D1 O.lg n/ D O.n lg n/ : 198 Chapter 7 Quicksort This bound and Lemma 7.1 allow us to conclude that the expected running time of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT is O.n lg n/ (assuming that the element values are distinct). Exercises 7.4-1 Show that the recurrence T .n/ D max fT .q/ C T .n  q  1/ W 0 හ q හ n  1g C ‚.n/ has a lower bound of T .n/ D �.n 2 /. 7.4-2 Show that quicksort’s best-case running time is �.n lg n/. 7.4-3 Show that the expression q 2 C .n  q  1/ 2 achieves its maximum value over q D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1 when q D 0 or q D n  1. 7.4-4 Show that RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT’s expected running time is �.n lg n/. 7.4-5 Coarsening the recursion, as we did in Problem 2-1 for merge sort, is a common way to improve the running time of quicksort in practice. We modify the base case of the recursion so that if the array has fewer than k elements, the subarray is sorted by insertion sort, rather than by continued recursive calls to quicksort. Argue that the randomized version of this sorting algorithm runs in O.nk C n lg.n=k// expected time. How should you pick k, both in theory and in practice? ? 7.4-6 Consider modifying the PARTITION procedure by randomly picking three elements from subarray AŒp W r� and partitioning about their median (the middle value of the three elements). Approximate the probability of getting worse than an ˛-to-.1  ˛/ split, as a function of ˛ in the range 0 < ˛ < 1=2. Problems for Chapter 7 199 Problems 7-1 Hoare partition correctness The version of PARTITION given in this chapter is not the original partitioning al- gorithm. Here is the original partitioning algorithm, which is due to C. A. R. Hoare.

Demonstrate the operation of HOARE-PARTITION on the array A D h13; 19; 9; 5; 12; 8; 7; 4; 11; 2; 6; 21i, showing the values of the array and the indices i and j after each iteration of the while loop in lines 4313. b. Describe how the PARTITION procedure in Section 7.1 differs from HOARE- PARTITION when all elements in AŒp W r� are equal. Describe a practical advan- tage of HOARE-PARTITION over PARTITION for use in quicksort. The next three questions ask you to give a careful argument that the procedure HOARE-PARTITION is correct. Assuming that the subarray AŒp W r� contains at least two elements, prove the following: c. The indices i and j are such that the procedure never accesses an element of A outside the subarray AŒp W r�. d. When HOARE-PARTITION terminates, it returns a value j such that p හ j < r . e. Every element of AŒp W j � is less than or equal to every element of AŒj C 1 W r� when HOARE-PARTITION terminates. 200 Chapter 7 Quicksort The PARTITION procedure in Section 7.1 separates the pivot value (originally in AŒr�) from the two partitions it forms. The HOARE-PARTITION procedure, on the other hand, always places the pivot value (originally in AŒp�) into one of the two partitions AŒp W j � and AŒj C 1 W r�. Since p හ j < r , neither partition is empty. f. Rewrite the QUICKSORT procedure to use HOARE-PARTITION. 7-2 Quicksort with equal element values The analysis of the expected running time of randomized quicksort in Section 7.4.2 assumes that all element values are distinct. This problem examines what happens when they are not. a. Suppose that all element values are equal. What is randomized quicksort’s running time in this case? b. The PARTITION procedure returns an index q such that each element of AŒp W q  1� is less than or equal to AŒq� and each element of AŒq C 1 W r� is greater than AŒq�. Modify the PARTITION procedure to produce a procedure PARTITION 0 .A; p; r/, which permutes the elements of AŒp W r� and returns two indices q and t , where p හ q හ t හ r , such that  all elements of AŒq W t� are equal,  each element of AŒp W q  1� is less than AŒq�, and  each element of AŒt C 1 W r� is greater than AŒq�. Like PARTITION, your PARTITION 0 procedure should take ‚.r  p/ time. c. Modify the RANDOMIZED-PARTITION procedure to call PARTITION 0 , and name the new procedure RANDOMIZED-PARTITION 0 . Then modify the QUICKSORT procedure to produce a procedure QUICKSORT 0 .A; p; r/ that calls RANDOMIZED-PARTITION 0 and recurses only on partitions where elements are not known to be equal to each other. d. Using QUICKSORT 0 , adjust the analysis in Section 7.4.2 to avoid the assumption that all elements are distinct. 7-3 Alternative quicksort analysis An alternative analysis of the running time of randomized quicksort focuses on the expected running time of each individual recursive call to R ANDOMIZED- QUICKSORT, rather than on the number of comparisons performed. As in the analysis of Section 7.4.2, assume that the values of the elements are distinct. Problems for Chapter 7 201 a.

Argue that the call STOOGE-SORT.A; 1; n/ correctly sorts the array AŒ1 W n�. b. Give a recurrence for the worst-case running time of STOOGE-SORT and a tight asymptotic (‚-notation) bound on the worst-case running time. c. Compare the worst-case running time of STOOGE-SORT with that of insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort. Do the professors deserve tenure? 202 Chapter 7 Quicksort STOOGE-SORT.A; p; r/ 1 if AŒp� > AŒr� 2 exchange AŒp� with AŒr� 3 if p C 1 < r 4 k D b.r  p C 1/=3c // round down 5 STOOGE-SORT.A; p; r  k/ // ûrst two-thirds 6 STOOGE-SORT.A; p C k; r/ // last two-thirds 7 STOOGE-SORT.A; p; r  k/ // ûrst two-thirds again 7-5 Stack depth for quicksort The QUICKSORT procedure of Section 7.1 makes two recursive calls to itself. After QUICKSORT calls PARTITION, it recursively sorts the low side of the partition and then it recursively sorts the high side of the partition. The second recursive call in QUICKSORT is not really necessary, because the procedure can instead use an iterative control structure. This transformation technique, called tail-recursion elimination, is provided automatically by good compilers. Applying tail-recursion elimination transforms QUICKSORT into the TRE-QUICKSORT procedure. TRE-QUICKSORT .A; p; r/ 1 while p < r 2 // Partition and then sort the low side. 3 q D PARTITION.A; p; r/ 4 TRE-QUICKSORT.A; p; q  1/ 5 p D q C 1 a. Argue that TRE-QUICKSORT .A; 1; n/ correctly sorts the array AŒ1 W n�. Compilers usually execute recursive procedures by using a stack that contains per- tinent information, including the parameter values, for each recursive call. The information for the most recent call is at the top of the stack, and the information for the initial call is at the bottom. When a procedure is called, its information is pushed onto the stack, and when it terminates, its information is popped. Since we assume that array parameters are represented by pointers, the information for each procedure call on the stack requires O.1/ stack space. The stack depth is the maximum amount of stack space used at any time during a computation. b. Describe a scenario in which TRE-QUICKSORT’s stack depth is ‚.n/ on an n-element input array. Problems for Chapter 7 203 c. Modify TRE-QUICKSORT so that the worst-case stack depth is ‚.lg n/. Main- tain the O.n lg n/ expected running time of the algorithm. 7-6 Median-of-3 partition One way to improve the RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT procedure is to partition around a pivot that is chosen more carefully than by picking a random element from the subarray. A common approach is the median-of-3 method: choose the pivot as the median (middle element) of a set of 3 elements randomly selected from the subarray. (See Exercise 7.4-6.) For this problem, assume that the n ele- ments in the input subarray AŒp W r� are distinct and that n  3. Denote the sorted version of AŒp W r� by ´ 1 ; ´ 2 ; : : : ; ´ n . Using the median-of-3 method to choose the pivot element x , deûne p i D Pr fx D ´ i g. a. Give an exact formula for p i as a function of n and i for i D 2; 3; : : : ; n  1. (Observe that p 1 D p n D 0.) b. By what amount does the median-of-3 method increase the likelihood of choos- ing the pivot to be x D ´ b.nC1/=2c , the median of AŒp W r�, compared with the ordinary implementation? Assume that n ! 1, and give the limiting ratio of these probabilities. c. Suppose that we deûne a <good= split to mean choosing the pivot as x D ´ i , where n=3 හ i හ 2n=3. By what amount does the median-of-3 method in- crease the likelihood of getting a good split compared with the ordinary imple- mentation? (Hint: Approximate the sum by an integral.) d. Argue that in the �.n lg n/ running time of quicksort, the median-of-3 method affects only the constant factor. 7-7 Fuzzy sorting of intervals Consider a sorting problem in which you do not know the numbers exactly. In- stead, for each number, you know an interval on the real line to which it belongs. That is, you are given n closed intervals of the form Œa i ; b i �, where a i හ b i . The goal is to fuzzy-sort these intervals: to produce a permutation hi 1 ; i 2 ; : : : ; i n i of the intervals such that for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n, there exist c j 2 Œa i j ; b i j � satisfying c 1 හ c 2 හ    හ c n . a. Design a randomized algorithm for fuzzy-sorting n intervals. Your algorithm should have the general structure of an algorithm that quicksorts the left end- points (the a i values), but it should take advantage of overlapping intervals to improve the running time. (As the intervals overlap more and more, the prob- 204 Chapter 7 Quicksort lem of fuzzy-sorting the intervals becomes progressively easier. Your algorithm should take advantage of such overlapping, to the extent that it exists.) b. Argue that your algorithm runs in ‚.n lg n/ expected time in general, but runs in ‚.n/ expected time when all of the intervals overlap (i.e., when there exists a value x such that x 2 Œa i ; b i � for all i ). Your algorithm should not be checking for this case explicitly, but rather, its performance should naturally improve as the amount of overlap increases. Chapter notes Quicksort was invented by Hoare [219], and his version of PARTITION appears in Problem 7-1. Bentley [51, p. 117] attributes the PARTITION procedure given in Section 7.1 to N. Lomuto. The analysis in Section 7.4 based on an analysis due to Motwani and Raghavan [336]. Sedgewick [401] and Bentley [51] provide good references on the details of implementation and how they matter. McIlroy [323] shows how to engineer a <killer adversary= that produces an array on which virtually any implementation of quicksort takes ‚.n 2 / time. 8 Sorting in Linear Time We have now seen a handful of algorithms that can sort n numbers in O.n lg n/ time. Whereas merge sort and heapsort achieve this upper bound in the worst case, quicksort achieves it on average. Moreover, for each of these algorithms, we can produce a sequence of n input numbers that causes the algorithm to run in �.n lg n/ time. These algorithms share an interesting property: the sorted order they determine is based only on comparisons between the input elements. We call such sorting algorithms comparison sorts. All the sorting algorithms introduced thus far are comparison sorts. In Section 8.1, we’ll prove that any comparison sort must make �.n lg n/ com- parisons in the worst case to sort n elements. Thus, merge sort and heapsort are asymptotically optimal, and no comparison sort exists that is faster by more than a constant factor. Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 examine three sorting algorithms4counting sort, radix sort, and bucket sort4that run in linear time on certain types of inputs. Of course, these algorithms use operations other than comparisons to determine the sorted order. Consequently, the �.n lg n/ lower bound does not apply to them. 8.1 Lower bounds for sorting A comparison sort uses only comparisons between elements to gain order infor- mation about an input sequence ha 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n i. That is, given two elements a i and a j , it performs one of the tests a i < a j , a i හ a j , a i D a j , a i  a j , or a i > a j to determine their relative order. It may not inspect the values of the elements or gain order information about them in any other way. Since we are proving a lower bound, we assume without loss of generality in this section that all the input elements are distinct. After all, a lower bound for distinct elements applies when elements may or may not be distinct. Consequently, 206 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time ≤ > ≤ > 1:2 2:3 1:3 〈1,2,3〉 1:3 〈2,1,3〉 2:3 〈1,3,2〉 〈3,1,2〉 〈3,2,1〉 ≤ > ≤ > ≤ > 〈2,3,1〉 Figure 8.1 The decision tree for insertion sort operating on three elements. An internal node (shown in blue) annotated by i :j indicates a comparison between a i and a j . A leaf annotated by the permutation h�.1/; �.2/; : : : ; �.n/ i indicates the ordering a .1/ හ a .2/ හ    හ a .n/ . The high- lighted path indicates the decisions made when sorting the input sequence ha 1 D 6; a 2 D 8; a 3 D 5i. Going left from the root node, labeled 1:2, indicates that a 1 හ a 2 . Going right from the node labeled 2:3 indicates that a 2 > a 3 . Going right from the node labeled 1:3 indicates that a 1 > a 3 . Therefore, we have the ordering a 3 හ a 1 හ a 2 , as indicated in the leaf labeled h3; 1; 2i. Because the three input elements have 3Š D 6 possible permutations, the decision tree must have at least 6 leaves. comparisons of the form a i D a j are useless, which means that we can assume that no comparisons for exact equality occur. Moreover, the comparisons a i හ a j , a i  a j , a i > a j , and a i < a j are all equivalent in that they yield identical information about the relative order of a i and a j . We therefore assume that all comparisons have the form a i හ a j . The decision-tree model We can view comparison sorts abstractly in terms of decision trees. A decision tree is a full binary tree (each node is either a leaf or has both children) that repre- sents the comparisons between elements that are performed by a particular sorting algorithm operating on an input of a given size. Control, data movement, and all other aspects of the algorithm are ignored. Figure 8.1 shows the decision tree cor- responding to the insertion sort algorithm from Section 2.1 operating on an input sequence of three elements. A decision tree has each internal node annotated by i :j for some i and j in the range 1 හ i; j හ n, where n is the number of elements in the input sequence. We also annotate each leaf by a permutation h�.1/; �.2/; : : : ; �.n/ i. (See Sec- tion C.1 for background on permutations.) Indices in the internal nodes and the leaves always refer to the original positions of the array elements at the start of the sorting algorithm. The execution of the comparison sorting algorithm corresponds to tracing a simple path from the root of the decision tree down to a leaf. Each internal node indicates a comparison a i හ a j . The left subtree then dictates sub- 8.1 Lower bounds for sorting 207 sequent comparisons once we know that a i හ a j , and the right subtree dictates subsequent comparisons when a i > a j . Arriving at a leaf, the sorting algorithm has established the ordering a .1/ හ a .2/ හ    හ a .n/ . Because any correct sort- ing algorithm must be able to produce each permutation of its input, each of the nŠ permutations on n elements must appear as at least one of the leaves of the decision tree for a comparison sort to be correct. Furthermore, each of these leaves must be reachable from the root by a downward path corresponding to an actual execution of the comparison sort. (We call such leaves <reachable.=) Thus, we consider only decision trees in which each permutation appears as a reachable leaf. A lower bound for the worst case The length of the longest simple path from the root of a decision tree to any of its reachable leaves represents the worst-case number of comparisons that the cor- responding sorting algorithm performs. Consequently, the worst-case number of comparisons for a given comparison sort algorithm equals the height of its decision tree. A lower bound on the heights of all decision trees in which each permutation appears as a reachable leaf is therefore a lower bound on the running time of any comparison sort algorithm. The following theorem establishes such a lower bound. Theorem 8.1 Any comparison sort algorithm requires �.n lg n/ comparisons in the worst case. Proof From the preceding discussion, it sufûces to determine the height of a decision tree in which each permutation appears as a reachable leaf. Consider a decision tree of height h with l reachable leaves corresponding to a comparison sort on n elements. Because each of the nŠ permutations of the input appears as one or more leaves, we have nŠ හ l . Since a binary tree of height h has no more than 2 h leaves, we have nŠ හ l හ 2 h ; which, by taking logarithms, implies  lg.nŠ/ (since the lg function is monotonically increasing) D �.n lg n/ (by equation (3.28) on page 67) . Corollary 8.2 Heapsort and merge sort are asymptotically optimal comparison sorts. Proof The O.n lg n/ upper bounds on the running times for heapsort and merge sort match the �.n lg n/ worst-case lower bound from Theorem 8.1. 208 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time Exercises 8.1-1 What is the smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a comparison sort? 8.1-2 Obtain asymptotically tight bounds on lg.nŠ/ without using Stirling’s approxi- mation. Instead, evaluate the summation P n kD1 lg k using techniques from Sec- tion A.2. 8.1-3 Show that there is no comparison sort whose running time is linear for at least half of the nŠ inputs of length n. What about a fraction of 1=n of the inputs of length n? What about a fraction 1=2 n ? 8.1-4 You are given an n-element input sequence, and you know in advance that it is partly sorted in the following sense. Each element initially in position i such that i mod 4 D 0 is either already in its correct position, or it is one place away from its correct position. For example, you know that after sorting, the element initially in position 12 belongs in position 11, 12, or 13. You have no advance information about the other elements, in positions i where i mod 4 ¤ 0. Show that an �.n lg n/ lower bound on comparison-based sorting still holds in this case. 8.2 Counting sort Counting sort assumes that each of the n input elements is an integer in the range 0 to k, for some integer k. It runs in ‚.n C k/ time, so that when k D O.n/, counting sort runs in ‚.n/ time. Counting sort ûrst determines, for each input element x , the number of elements less than or equal to x . It then uses this information to place element x directly into its position in the output array. For example, if 17 elements are less than or equal to x , then x belongs in output position 17. We must modify this scheme slightly to handle the situation in which several elements have the same value, since we do not want them all to end up in the same position. The COUNTING-SORT procedure on the facing page takes as input an array AŒ1 W n�, the size n of this array, and the limit k on the nonnegative integer values in A. It returns its sorted output in the array BŒ1 W n� and uses an array C Œ0 W k� for temporary working storage. 8.2 Counting sort 209 COUNTING-SORT.A; n; k/ 1 let BŒ1 W n� and C Œ0 W k� be new arrays 2 for i D 0 to k 3 C Œi � D 0 4 for j D 1 to n 5 C ŒAŒj �� D C ŒAŒj �� C 1 6 // C Œi � now contains the number of elements equal to i . 7 for i D 1 to k 8 C Œi � D C Œi � C C Œi  1� 9 // C Œi � now contains the number of elements less than or equal to i . 10 // Copy A to B , starting from the end of A. 11 for j D n downto 1 12 BŒC ŒAŒj ��� D AŒj � 13 C ŒAŒj �� D C ŒAŒj ��  1 // to handle duplicate values 14 return B Figure 8.2 illustrates counting sort. After the for loop of lines 233 initializes the array C to all zeros, the for loop of lines 435 makes a pass over the array A to inspect each input element. Each time it ûnds an input element whose value is i , it increments C Œi �. Thus, after line 5, C Œi � holds the number of input elements equal to i for each integer i D 0; 1; : : : ; k. Lines 738 determine for each i D 0; 1; : : : ; k how many input elements are less than or equal to i by keeping a running sum of the array C . Finally, the for loop of lines 11313 makes another pass over A, but in reverse, to place each element AŒj � into its correct sorted position in the output array B . If all n elements are distinct, then when line 11 is ûrst entered, for each AŒj �, the value C ŒAŒj �� is the correct ûnal position of AŒj � in the output array, since there are C ŒAŒj �� elements less than or equal to AŒj �. Because the elements might not be distinct, the loop decrements C ŒAŒj �� each time it places a value AŒj � into B . Decrementing C ŒAŒj �� causes the previous element in A with a value equal to AŒj �, if one exists, to go to the position immediately before AŒj � in the output array B . How much time does counting sort require? The for loop of lines 233 takes ‚.k/ time, the for loop of lines 435 takes ‚.n/ time, the for loop of lines 738 takes ‚.k/ time, and the for loop of lines 11313 takes ‚.n/ time. Thus, the overall time is ‚.k C n/. In practice, we usually use counting sort when we have k D O.n/, in which case the running time is ‚.n/. Counting sort can beat the lower bound of �.n lg n/ proved in Section 8.1 be- cause it is not a comparison sort. In fact, no comparisons between input elements occur anywhere in the code. Instead, counting sort uses the actual values of the 210 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 2 5 3 0 2 3 0 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 0 2 3 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 A C (a) 2 2 4 7 7 8 C (b) 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 2 4 6 7 8 B C (c) 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 4 6 7 8 B C (d) 0 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 4 5 7 8 B C (e) 0 3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 B (f) 0 3 0 2 2 3 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 Figure 8.2 The operation of C OUNTING-SORT on an input array AŒ1 W 8�, where each element of A is a nonnegative integer no larger than k D 5.

(f) The ûnal sorted output array B. elements to index into an array. The �.n lg n/ lower bound for sorting does not apply when we depart from the comparison sort model. An important property of counting sort is that it is stable: elements with the same value appear in the output array in the same order as they do in the input array. That is, it breaks ties between two elements by the rule that whichever element appears ûrst in the input array appears ûrst in the output array. Normally, the property of stability is important only when satellite data are carried around with the element being sorted. Counting sort’s stability is important for another reason: counting sort is often used as a subroutine in radix sort. As we shall see in the next section, in order for radix sort to work correctly, counting sort must be stable. Exercises 8.2-1 Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of COUNTING-SORT on the array A D h6; 0; 2; 0; 1; 3; 4; 6; 1; 3; 2i. 8.2-2 Prove that COUNTING-SORT is stable. 8.3 Radix sort 211 8.2-3 Suppose that we were to rewrite the for loop header in line 11 of the COUNTING- SORT as 11 for j D 1 to n Show that the algorithm still works properly, but that it is not stable. Then rewrite the pseudocode for counting sort so that elements with the same value are written into the output array in order of increasing index and the algorithm is stable. 8.2-4 Prove the following loop invariant for COUNTING-SORT: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 11313, the last element in A with value i that has not yet been copied into B belongs in BŒC Œi ��. 8.2-5 Suppose that the array being sorted contains only integers in the range 0 to k and that there are no satellite data to move with those keys. Modify counting sort to use just the arrays A and C , putting the sorted result back into array A instead of into a new array B . 8.2-6 Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range 0 to k, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the n integers fall into a range Œa W b� in O.1/ time. Your algorithm should use ‚.n C k/ preprocessing time. 8.2-7 Counting sort can also work efûciently if the input values have fractional parts, but the number of digits in the fractional part is small. Suppose that you are given n numbers in the range 0 to k, each with at most d decimal (base 10) digits to the right of the decimal point. Modify counting sort to run in ‚.n C 10 d k/ time. 8.3 Radix sort Radix sort is the algorithm used by the card-sorting machines you now ûnd only in computer museums. The cards have 80 columns, and in each column a machine can punch a hole in one of 12 places. The sorter can be mechanically <programmed= to examine a given column of each card in a deck and distribute the card into one 212 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 329 457 657 839 436 720 355 329 457 657 839 436 720 355 329 457 657 839 436 720 355 329 457 657 839 436 720 355 Figure 8.3 The operation of radix sort on seven 3-digit numbers. The leftmost column is the input. The remaining columns show the numbers after successive sorts on increasingly signiûcant digit positions. Tan shading indicates the digit position sorted on to produce each list from the previous one. of 12 bins depending on which place has been punched. An operator can then gather the cards bin by bin, so that cards with the ûrst place punched are on top of cards with the second place punched, and so on. For decimal digits, each column uses only 10 places. (The other two places are reserved for encoding nonnumeric characters.) A d -digit number occupies a ûeld of d columns. Since the card sorter can look at only one column at a time, the problem of sorting n cards on a d -digit number requires a sorting algorithm. Intuitively, you might sort numbers on their most signiﬁcant (leftmost) digit, sort each of the resulting bins recursively, and then combine the decks in order. Unfortunately, since the cards in 9 of the 10 bins must be put aside to sort each of the bins, this procedure generates many intermediate piles of cards that you would have to keep track of. (See Exercise 8.3-6.) Radix sort solves the problem of card sorting4counterintuitively4by sorting on the least signiﬁcant digit ûrst. The algorithm then combines the cards into a single deck, with the cards in the 0 bin preceding the cards in the 1 bin preceding the cards in the 2 bin, and so on. Then it sorts the entire deck again on the second-least signiûcant digit and recombines the deck in a like manner. The process continues until the cards have been sorted on all d digits. Remarkably, at that point the cards are fully sorted on the d -digit number. Thus, only d passes through the deck are required to sort. Figure 8.3 shows how radix sort operates on a <deck= of seven 3-digit numbers. In order for radix sort to work correctly, the digit sorts must be stable. The sort performed by a card sorter is stable, but the operator must be careful not to change the order of the cards as they come out of a bin, even though all the cards in a bin have the same digit in the chosen column. In a typical computer, which is a sequential random-access machine, we some- times use radix sort to sort records of information that are keyed by multiple ûelds. For example, we might wish to sort dates by three keys: year, month, and day. We could run a sorting algorithm with a comparison function that, given two dates, 8.3 Radix sort 213 compares years, and if there is a tie, compares months, and if another tie occurs, compares days. Alternatively, we could sort the information three times with a stable sort: ûrst on day (the <least signiûcant= part), next on month, and ûnally on year. The code for radix sort is straightforward. The RADIX-SORT procedure assumes that each element in array AŒ1 W n� has d digits, where digit 1 is the lowest-order digit and digit d is the highest-order digit. RADIX-SORT.A; n; d / 1 for i D 1 to d 2 use a stable sort to sort array AŒ1 W n� on digit i Although the pseudocode for RADIX-SORT does not specify which stable sort to use, COUNTING-SORT is commonly used. If you use C OUNTING-SORT as the sta- ble sort, you can make RADIX-SORT a little more efûcient by revising COUNTING- SORT to take a pointer to the output array as a parameter, having R ADIX-SORT preallocate this array, and alternating input and output between the two arrays in successive iterations of the for loop in RADIX-SORT. Lemma 8.3 Given n d -digit numbers in which each digit can take on up to k possible values, RADIX-SORT correctly sorts these numbers in ‚.d.n C k// time if the stable sort it uses takes ‚.n C k/ time. Proof The correctness of radix sort follows by induction on the column being sorted (see Exercise 8.3-3). The analysis of the running time depends on the stable sort used as the intermediate sorting algorithm. When each digit lies in the range 0 to k  1 (so that it can take on k possible values), and k is not too large, counting sort is the obvious choice. Each pass over n d -digit numbers then takes ‚.n C k/ time. There are d passes, and so the total time for radix sort is ‚.d.n C k//. When d is constant and k D O.n/, we can make radix sort run in linear time. More generally, we have some üexibility in how to break each key into digits. Lemma 8.4 Given n b-bit numbers and any positive integer r හ b, RADIX-SORT correctly sorts these numbers in ‚..b=r/.n C 2 r // time if the stable sort it uses takes ‚.n C k/ time for inputs in the range 0 to k. 214 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time Proof For a value r හ b, view each key as having d D db=r e digits of r bits each. Each digit is an integer in the range 0 to 2 r  1, so that we can use counting sort with k D 2 r  1. (For example, we can view a 32-bit word as having four 8-bit digits, so that b D 32, r D 8, k D 2 r  1 D 255, and d D b=r D 4.) Each pass of counting sort takes ‚.n C k/ D ‚.n C 2 r / time and there are d passes, for a total running time of ‚.d.n C 2 r // D ‚..b=r/.n C 2 r //. Given n and b, what value of r හ b minimizes the expression .b=r/.n C 2 r /? As r decreases, the factor b=r increases, but as r increases so does 2 r . The answer depends on whether b < blg nc. If b < blg nc, then r හ b implies .nC2 r / D ‚.n/. Thus, choosing r D b yields a running time of .b=b/.n C 2 b / D ‚.n/, which is asymptotically optimal. If b  blg nc, then choosing r D blg nc gives the best running time to within a constant factor, which we can see as follows. 1 Choosing r D blg nc yields a running time of ‚.bn= lg n/. As r increases above blg nc, the 2 r term in the numerator increases faster than the r term in the denominator, and so increasing r above blg nc yields a running time of �.bn= lg n/. If instead r were to decrease below blg nc, then the b=r term increases and the n C 2 r term remains at ‚.n/. Is radix sort preferable to a comparison-based sorting algorithm, such as quick- sort? If b D O.lg n/, as is often the case, and r  lg n, then radix sort’s running time is ‚.n/, which appears to be better than quicksort’s expected running time of ‚.n lg n/. The constant factors hidden in the ‚-notation differ, however. Al- though radix sort may make fewer passes than quicksort over the n keys, each pass of radix sort may take signiûcantly longer. Which sorting algorithm to prefer depends on the characteristics of the implementations, of the underlying machine (e.g., quicksort often uses hardware caches more effectively than radix sort), and of the input data. Moreover, the version of radix sort that uses counting sort as the intermediate stable sort does not sort in place, which many of the ‚.n lg n/-time comparison sorts do. Thus, when primary memory storage is at a premium, an in-place algorithm such as quicksort could be the better choice. Exercises 8.3-1 Using Figure 8.3 as a model, illustrate the operation of RADIX-SORT on the fol- lowing list of English words: COW, DOG, SEA, RUG, ROW, MOB, BOX, TAB, BAR, EAR, TAR, DIG, BIG, TEA, NOW, FOX. 1 The choice of r D blg nc assumes that n > 1. If n හ 1, there is nothing to sort. 8.4 Bucket sort 215 8.3-2 Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable: insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort? Give a simple scheme that makes any comparison sort stable. How much additional time and space does your scheme entail? 8.3-3 Use induction to prove that radix sort works. Where does your proof need the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable? 8.3-4 Suppose that COUNTING-SORT is used as the stable sort within RADIX-SORT. If RADIX-SORT calls COUNTING-SORT d times, then since each call of COUNTING- SORT makes two passes over the data (lines 435 and 11313), altogether 2d passes over the data occur. Describe how to reduce the total number of passes to d C 1. 8.3-5 Show how to sort n integers in the range 0 to n 3  1 in O.n/ time. ? 8.3-6 In the ûrst card-sorting algorithm in this section, which sorts on the most signiûcant digit ûrst, exactly how many sorting passes are needed to sort d -digit decimal numbers in the worst case? How many piles of cards does an operator need to keep track of in the worst case? 8.4 Bucket sort Bucket sort assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution and has an average-case running time of O.n/. Like counting sort, bucket sort is fast because it assumes something about the input. Whereas counting sort assumes that the input consists of integers in a small range, bucket sort assumes that the input is generated by a random process that distributes elements uniformly and independently over the interval Œ0; 1/. (See Section C.2 for a deûnition of a uniform distribution.) Bucket sort divides the interval Œ0; 1/ into n equal-sized subintervals, or buckets, and then distributes the n input numbers into the buckets. Since the inputs are uni- formly and independently distributed over Œ0; 1/, we do not expect many numbers to fall into each bucket. To produce the output, we simply sort the numbers in each bucket and then go through the buckets in order, listing the elements in each. The BUCKET-SORT procedure on the next page assumes that the input is an array AŒ1 W n� and that each element AŒi � in the array satisûes 0 හ AŒi � < 1. The code requires an auxiliary array BŒ0 W n  1� of linked lists (buckets) and assumes 216 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .78 .17 .39 .72 .94 .21 .12 .23 .68 A (a) 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 B (b) 0 .12 .17 .21 .23 .26 .26 .39 .68 .72 .78 .94 Figure 8.4 The operation of BUCKET-SORT for n D 10.

The sorted output consists of a concatenation of the lists BŒ0�; BŒ1�; : : : ; BŒ9� in order. that there is a mechanism for maintaining such lists. (Section 10.2 describes how to implement basic operations on linked lists.) Figure 8.4 shows the operation of bucket sort on an input array of 10 numbers. BUCKET-SORT.A; n/ 1 let BŒ0 W n  1� be a new array 2 for i D 0 to n  1 3 make BŒi � an empty list 4 for i D 1 to n 5 insert AŒi � into list BŒbn  AŒi �c� 6 for i D 0 to n  1 7 sort list BŒi � with insertion sort 8 concatenate the lists BŒ0�; BŒ1�; : : : ; BŒn  1� together in order 9 return the concatenated lists To see that this algorithm works, consider two elements AŒi � and AŒj �. Assume without loss of generality that AŒi � හ AŒj �. Since bn  AŒi �c හ bn  AŒj �c, either element AŒi � goes into the same bucket as AŒj � or it goes into a bucket with a lower index. If AŒi � and AŒj � go into the same bucket, then the for loop of lines 637 puts them into the proper order. If AŒi � and AŒj � go into different buckets, then line 8 puts them into the proper order. Therefore, bucket sort works correctly. 8.4 Bucket sort 217 To analyze the running time, observe that, together, all lines except line 7 take O.n/ time in the worst case. We need to analyze the total time taken by the n calls to insertion sort in line 7. To analyze the cost of the calls to insertion sort, let n i be the random variable denoting the number of elements placed in bucket BŒi �. Since insertion sort runs in quadratic time (see Section 2.2), the running time of bucket sort is T .n/ D ‚.n/ C n1 X i D0 O.n 2 i / : (8.1) We now analyze the average-case running time of bucket sort, by computing the expected value of the running time, where we take the expectation over the input distribution. Taking expectations of both sides and using linearity of expectation (equation (C.24) on page 1192), we have E ŒT .n/� D E \" ‚.n/ C n1 X i D0 O.n 2 i / # D ‚.n/ C n1 X i D0 E í O.n 2 i / î (by linearity of expectation) D ‚.n/ C n1 X i D0 O ã E í n 2 i îä (by equation (C.25) on page 1193) . (8.2) We claim that E í n 2 i î D 2  1=n (8.3) for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. It is no surprise that each bucket i has the same value of E Œn 2 i �, since each value in the input array A is equally likely to fall in any bucket. To prove equation (8.3), view each random variable n i as the number of suc- cesses in n Bernoulli trials (see Section C.4). Success in a trial occurs when an element goes into bucket BŒi �, with a probability p D 1=n of success and q D 1  1=n of failure. A binomial distribution counts n i , the number of suc- cesses, in the n trials. By equations (C.41) and (C.44) on pages 119931200, we have E Œn i � D np D n.1=n/ D 1 and Var Œn i � D npq D 1  1=n. Equation (C.31) on page 1194 gives E í n 2 i î D Var Œn i � C E 2 Œn i � D .1  1=n/ C 1 2 D 2  1=n ; 218 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time which proves equation (8.3). Using this expected value in equation (8.2), we get that the average-case running time for bucket sort is ‚.n/ Cn  O.2 1=n/ D ‚.n/. Even if the input is not drawn from a uniform distribution, bucket sort may still run in linear time. As long as the input has the property that the sum of the squares of the bucket sizes is linear in the total number of elements, equation (8.1) tells us that bucket sort runs in linear time.

Give an algorithm that sorts these numbers in linear average-case time. Problems 8-1 Probabilistic lower bounds on comparison sorting In this problem, you will prove a probabilistic �.n lg n/ lower bound on the run- ning time of any deterministic or randomized comparison sort on n distinct input elements. You’ll begin by examining a deterministic comparison sort A with deci- sion tree T A . Assume that every permutation of A’s inputs is equally likely. a. Suppose that each leaf of T A is labeled with the probability that it is reached given a random input. Prove that exactly nŠ leaves are labeled 1=nŠ and that the rest are labeled 0. b. Let D.T / denote the external path length of a decision tree T 4the sum of the depths of all the leaves of T . Let T be a decision tree with k > 1 leaves, and let LT and RT be the left and right subtrees of T . Show that D.T / D D.LT / C D.RT / C k. c. Let d.k/ be the minimum value of D.T / over all decision trees T with k > 1 leaves. Show that d.k/ D min fd.i / C d.k  i / C k W 1 හ i හ k  1g. (Hint: Consider a decision tree T with k leaves that achieves the minimum. Let i 0 be the number of leaves in LT and k  i 0 the number of leaves in RT .) d. Prove that for a given value of k > 1 and i in the range 1 හ i හ k  1, the function i lg i C .k  i / lg.k  i / is minimized at i D k=2. Conclude that d.k/ D �.k lg k/. e. Prove that D.T A / D �.nŠ lg.nŠ//, and conclude that the average-case time to sort n elements is �.n lg n/. Now consider a randomized comparison sort B . We can extend the decision-tree model to handle randomization by incorporating two kinds of nodes: ordinary com- parison nodes and <randomization= nodes. A randomization node models a random choice of the form RANDOM.1; r/ made by algorithm B . The node has r children, each of which is equally likely to be chosen during an execution of the algorithm. f. Show that for any randomized comparison sort B , there exists a deterministic comparison sort A whose expected number of comparisons is no more than those made by B . 220 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 8-2 Sorting in place in linear time You have an array of n data records to sort, each with a key of 0 or 1. An algorithm for sorting such a set of records might possess some subset of the following three desirable characteristics: 1. The algorithm runs in O.n/ time. 2. The algorithm is stable. 3. The algorithm sorts in place, using no more than a constant amount of storage space in addition to the original array. a. Give an algorithm that satisûes criteria 1 and 2 above. b. Give an algorithm that satisûes criteria 1 and 3 above. c. Give an algorithm that satisûes criteria 2 and 3 above. d. Can you use any of your sorting algorithms from parts (a)–(c) as the sorting method used in line 2 of RADIX-SORT, so that RADIX-SORT sorts n records with b-bit keys in O.bn/ time? Explain how or why not. e. Suppose that the n records have keys in the range from 1 to k. Show how to modify counting sort so that it sorts the records in place in O.n C k/ time. You may use O.k/ storage outside the input array. Is your algorithm stable? 8-3 Sorting variable-length items a. You are given an array of integers, where different integers may have different numbers of digits, but the total number of digits over all the integers in the array is n. Show how to sort the array in O.n/ time. b. You are given an array of strings, where different strings may have different numbers of characters, but the total number of characters over all the strings is n. Show how to sort the strings in O.n/ time. (The desired order is the standard alphabetical order: for example, a < ab < b.) 8-4 Water jugs You are given n red and n blue water jugs, all of different shapes and sizes. All the red jugs hold different amounts of water, as do all the blue jugs, and you cannot tell from the size of a jug how much water it holds. Moreover, for every jug of one color, there is a jug of the other color that holds the same amount of water. Your task is to group the jugs into pairs of red and blue jugs that hold the same amount of water. To do so, you may perform the following operation: pick a pair Problems for Chapter 8 221 of jugs in which one is red and one is blue, ûll the red jug with water, and then pour the water into the blue jug. This operation tells you whether the red jug or the blue jug can hold more water, or that they have the same volume. Assume that such a comparison takes one time unit. Your goal is to ûnd an algorithm that makes a minimum number of comparisons to determine the grouping. Remember that you may not directly compare two red jugs or two blue jugs. a. Describe a deterministic algorithm that uses ‚.n 2 / comparisons to group the jugs into pairs. b. Prove a lower bound of �.n lg n/ for the number of comparisons that an algo- rithm solving this problem must make. c. Give a randomized algorithm whose expected number of comparisons is O.n lg n/, and prove that this bound is correct. What is the worst-case num- ber of comparisons for your algorithm? 8-5 Average sorting Suppose that, instead of sorting an array, we just require that the elements increase on average. More precisely, we call an n-element array A k-sorted if, for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  k, the following holds: P i Ck1 j Di AŒj � k හ P i Ck j Di C1 AŒj � k : a. What does it mean for an array to be 1-sorted? b. Give a permutation of the numbers 1; 2; : : : ; 10 that is 2-sorted, but not sorted. c. Prove that an n-element array is k-sorted if and only if AŒi � හ AŒi C k� for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  k. d. Give an algorithm that k-sorts an n-element array in O.n lg.n=k// time. We can also show a lower bound on the time to produce a k-sorted array, when k is a constant. e. Show how to sort a k-sorted array of length n in O.n lg k/ time. (Hint: Use the solution to Exercise 6.5-11.) f. Show that when k is a constant, k-sorting an n-element array requires �.n lg n/ time. (Hint: Use the solution to part (e) along with the lower bound on compar- ison sorts.) 222 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 8-6 Lower bound on merging sorted lists The problem of merging two sorted lists arises frequently. We have seen a proce- dure for it as the subroutine MERGE in Section 2.3.1. In this problem, you will prove a lower bound of 2n  1 on the worst-case number of comparisons required to merge two sorted lists, each containing n items. First, you will show a lower bound of 2n  o.n/ comparisons by using a decision tree. a. Given 2n numbers, compute the number of possible ways to divide them into two sorted lists, each with n numbers. b. Using a decision tree and your answer to part (a), show that any algorithm that correctly merges two sorted lists must perform at least 2n  o.n/ comparisons. Now you will show a slightly tighter 2n  1 bound. c. Show that if two elements are consecutive in the sorted order and from different lists, then they must be compared. d. Use your answer to part (c) to show a lower bound of 2n  1 comparisons for merging two sorted lists. 8-7 The 0-1 sorting lemma and columnsort A compare-exchange operation on two array elements AŒi � and AŒj �, where i < j , has the form COMPARE-EXCHANGE .A; i; j / 1 if AŒi � > AŒj � 2 exchange AŒi � with AŒj � After the compare-exchange operation, we know that AŒi � හ AŒj �. An oblivious compare-exchange algorithm operates solely by a sequence of prespeciûed compare-exchange operations. The indices of the positions compared in the sequence must be determined in advance, and although they can depend on the number of elements being sorted, they cannot depend on the values being sorted, nor can they depend on the result of any prior compare-exchange operation. For example, the COMPARE-EXCHANGE-I NSERTION-SORT procedure on the fac- ing page shows a variation of insertion sort as an oblivious compare-exchange algo- rithm. (Unlike the I NSERTION-SORT procedure on page 19, the oblivious version runs in ‚.n 2 / time in all cases.) The 0-1 sorting lemma provides a powerful way to prove that an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm produces a sorted result. It states that if an oblivi- ous compare-exchange algorithm correctly sorts all input sequences consisting of only 0s and 1s, then it correctly sorts all inputs containing arbitrary values. Problems for Chapter 8 223 COMPARE-EXCHANGE-I NSERTION-SORT .A; n/ 1 for i D 2 to n 2 for j D i  1 downto 1 3 COMPARE-EXCHANGE .A; j; j C 1/ You will prove the 0-1 sorting lemma by proving its contrapositive: if an oblivi- ous compare-exchange algorithm fails to sort an input containing arbitrary values, then it fails to sort some 0-1 input. Assume that an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm X fails to correctly sort the array AŒ1 W n�. Let AŒp� be the smallest value in A that algorithm X puts into the wrong location, and let AŒq� be the value that algorithm X moves to the location into which AŒp� should have gone. Deûne an array BŒ1 W n� of 0s and 1s as follows: BŒi � D ( 0 if AŒi � හ AŒp� ; 1 if AŒi � > AŒp� : a. Argue that AŒq� > AŒp�, so that BŒp� D 0 and BŒq� D 1. b. To complete the proof of the 0-1 sorting lemma, prove that algorithm X fails to sort array B correctly. Now you will use the 0-1 sorting lemma to prove that a particular sorting algo- rithm works correctly. The algorithm, columnsort, works on a rectangular array of n elements. The array has r rows and s columns (so that n D rs ), subject to three restrictions: r must be even,  s must be a divisor of r , and  r  2s 2 . When columnsort completes, the array is sorted in column-major order: reading down each column in turn, from left to right, the elements monotonically increase. Columnsort operates in eight steps, regardless of the value of n. The odd steps are all the same: sort each column individually. Each even step is a ûxed permuta- tion. Here are the steps: 1. Sort each column. 2. Transpose the array, but reshape it back to r rows and s columns. In other words, turn the leftmost column into the top r=s rows, in order; turn the next column into the next r=s rows, in order; and so on. 224 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time 10 14 5 8 7 17 12 1 6 16 9 11 4 15 2 18 3 13 (a) 4 1 2 8 3 5 10 7 6 12 9 11 16 14 13 18 15 17 (b) 4 8 10 12 16 18 1 3 7 9 14 15 2 5 6 11 13 17 (c) 1 3 6 2 5 7 4 8 10 9 13 15 11 14 17 12 16 18 (d) 1 4 11 3 8 14 6 10 17 2 9 12 5 13 16 7 15 18 (e) 1 4 11 2 8 12 3 9 14 5 10 16 6 13 17 7 15 18 (f) 5 10 16 6 13 17 7 15 18 1 4 11 2 8 12 3 9 14 (g) 4 10 16 5 11 17 6 12 18 1 7 13 2 8 14 3 9 15 (h) 1 7 13 2 8 14 3 9 15 4 10 16 5 11 17 6 12 18 (i) Figure 8.5 The steps of columnsort.

Shift the top half of each column into the bottom half of the same column, and shift the bottom half of each column into the top half of the next column to the right. Leave the top half of the leftmost column empty. Shift the bottom half of the last column into the top half of a new rightmost column, and leave the bottom half of this new column empty. 7. Sort each column. 8. Perform the inverse of the permutation performed in step 6. You can think of steps 638 as a single step that sorts the bottom half of each column and the top half of the next column. Figure 8.5 shows an example of the steps of columnsort with r D 6 and s D 3. (Even though this example violates the requirement that r  2s 2 , it happens to work.) c. Argue that we can treat columnsort as an oblivious compare-exchange algo- rithm, even if we do not know what sorting method the odd steps use. Notes for Chapter 8 225 Although it might seem hard to believe that columnsort actually sorts, you will use the 0-1 sorting lemma to prove that it does. The 0-1 sorting lemma applies because we can treat columnsort as an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm. A couple of deûnitions will help you apply the 0-1 sorting lemma. We say that an area of an array is clean if we know that it contains either all 0s or all 1s or if it is empty. Otherwise, the area might contain mixed 0s and 1s, and it is dirty. From here on, assume that the input array contains only 0s and 1s, and that we can treat it as an array with r rows and s columns. d. Prove that after steps 133, the array consists of clean rows of 0s at the top, clean rows of 1s at the bottom, and at most s dirty rows between them. (One of the clean rows could be empty.) e. Prove that after step 4, the array, read in column-major order, starts with a clean area of 0s, ends with a clean area of 1s, and has a dirty area of at most s 2 elements in the middle. (Again, one of the clean areas could be empty.) f. Prove that steps 538 produce a fully sorted 0-1 output. Conclude that column- sort correctly sorts all inputs containing arbitrary values. g. Now suppose that s does not divide r . Prove that after steps 133, the array consists of clean rows of 0s at the top, clean rows of 1s at the bottom, and at most 2s  1 dirty rows between them. (Once again, one of the clean areas could be empty.) How large must r be, compared with s , for columnsort to correctly sort when s does not divide r ? h. Suggest a simple change to step 1 that allows us to maintain the requirement that r  2s 2 even when s does not divide r , and prove that with your change, columnsort correctly sorts. Chapter notes The decision-tree model for studying comparison sorts was introduced by Ford and Johnson [150]. Knuth’s comprehensive treatise on sorting [261] covers many variations on the sorting problem, including the information-theoretic lower bound on the complexity of sorting given here. Ben-Or [46] studied lower bounds for sorting using generalizations of the decision-tree model. Knuth credits H. H. Seward with inventing counting sort in 1954, as well as with the idea of combining counting sort with radix sort. Radix sorting starting with the least signiûcant digit appears to be a folk algorithm widely used by operators of 226 Chapter 8 Sorting in Linear Time mechanical card-sorting machines. According to Knuth, the ûrst published refer- ence to the method is a 1929 document by L. J. Comrie describing punched-card equipment. Bucket sorting has been in use since 1956, when the basic idea was proposed by Isaac and Singleton [235]. Munro and Raman [338] give a stable sorting algorithm that performs O.n 1C / comparisons in the worst case, where 0 < � හ 1 is any ûxed constant. Although any of the O.n lg n/-time algorithms make fewer comparisons, the algorithm by Munro and Raman moves data only O.n/ times and operates in place. The case of sorting n b-bit integers in o.n lg n/ time has been considered by many researchers. Several positive results have been obtained, each under slightly different assumptions about the model of computation and the restrictions placed on the algorithm. All the results assume that the computer memory is divided into addressable b-bit words. Fredman and Willard [157] introduced the fusion tree data structure and used it to sort n integers in O.n lg n= lg lg n/ time. This bound was later improved to O.n p lg n/ time by Andersson [17]. These algorithms require the use of multiplication and several precomputed constants. Andersson, Hagerup, Nilsson, and Raman [18] have shown how to sort n integers in O.n lg lg n/ time without using multiplication, but their method requires storage that can be un- bounded in terms of n. Using multiplicative hashing, we can reduce the storage needed to O.n/, but then the O.n lg lg n/ worst-case bound on the running time becomes an expected-time bound. Generalizing the exponential search trees of Andersson [17], Thorup [434] gave an O.n.lg lg n/ 2 /-time sorting algorithm that does not use multiplication or randomization, and it uses linear space. Combining these techniques with some new ideas, Han [207] improved the bound for sorting to O.n lg lg n lg lg lg n/ time. Although these algorithms are important theoretical breakthroughs, they are all fairly complicated and at the present time seem unlikely to compete with existing sorting algorithms in practice. The columnsort algorithm in Problem 8-7 is by Leighton [286]. 9 Medians and Order Statistics The i th order statistic of a set of n elements is the i th smallest element. For example, the minimum of a set of elements is the ûrst order statistic (i D 1), and the maximum is the nth order statistic (i D n). A median, informally, is the <halfway point= of the set. When n is odd, the median is unique, occurring at i D .n C1/=2. When n is even, there are two medians, the lower median occurring at i D n=2 and the upper median occurring at i D n=2 C 1. Thus, regardless of the parity of n, medians occur at i D b.n C 1/=2c and i D d.n C 1/=2e. For simplicity in this text, however, we consistently use the phrase <the median= to refer to the lower median. This chapter addresses the problem of selecting the i th order statistic from a set of n distinct numbers. We assume for convenience that the set contains dis- tinct numbers, although virtually everything that we do extends to the situation in which a set contains repeated values. We formally specify the selection problem as follows: Input: A set A of n distinct numbers 1 and an integer i , with 1 හ i හ n. Output: The element x 2 A that is larger than exactly i  1 other elements of A. We can solve the selection problem in O.n lg n/ time simply by sorting the num- bers using heapsort or merge sort and then outputting the i th element in the sorted array. This chapter presents asymptotically faster algorithms. Section 9.1 examines the problem of selecting the minimum and maximum of a set of elements. More interesting is the general selection problem, which we investigate in the subsequent two sections. Section 9.2 analyzes a practical ran- domized algorithm that achieves an O.n/ expected running time, assuming dis- 1 As in the footnote on page 182, you can enforce the assumption that the numbers are distinct by converting each input value AŒi� to an ordered pair .AŒi�; i/ with .AŒi�; i/ < .AŒj �; j / if either AŒi� < AŒj � or AŒi� D AŒj � and i < j . 228 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics tinct elements. Section 9.3 contains an algorithm of more theoretical interest that achieves the O.n/ running time in the worst case. 9.1 Minimum and maximum How many comparisons are necessary to determine the minimum of a set of n elements? To obtain an upper bound of n  1 comparisons, just examine each element of the set in turn and keep track of the smallest element seen so far. The MINIMUM procedure assumes that the set resides in array AŒ1 W n�. MINIMUM.A; n/ 1 min D AŒ1� 2 for i D 2 to n 3 if min > AŒi � 4 min D AŒi � 5 return min It’s no more difûcult to ûnd the maximum with n  1 comparisons. Is this algorithm for minimum the best we can do? Yes, because it turns out that there’s a lower bound of n  1 comparisons for the problem of determining the minimum. Think of any algorithm that determines the minimum as a tournament among the elements. Each comparison is a match in the tournament in which the smaller of the two elements wins. Since every element except the winner must lose at least one match, we can conclude that n  1 comparisons are necessary to determine the minimum. Hence the algorithm MINIMUM is optimal with respect to the number of comparisons performed. Simultaneous minimum and maximum Some applications need to ûnd both the minimum and the maximum of a set of n elements. For example, a graphics program may need to scale a set of .x; y/ data to ût onto a rectangular display screen or other graphical output device. To do so, the program must ûrst determine the minimum and maximum value of each coordinate. Of course, we can determine both the minimum and the maximum of n ele- ments using ‚.n/ comparisons. We simply ûnd the minimum and maximum in- dependently, using n  1 comparisons for each, for a total of 2n  2 D ‚.n/ comparisons. 9.1 Minimum and maximum 229 Although 2n  2 comparisons is asymptotically optimal, it is possible to improve the leading constant. We can ûnd both the minimum and the maximum using at most 3 bn=2c comparisons. The trick is to maintain both the minimum and maxi- mum elements seen thus far. Rather than processing each element of the input by comparing it against the current minimum and maximum, at a cost of 2 compar- isons per element, process elements in pairs. Compare pairs of elements from the input ûrst with each other, and then compare the smaller with the current mini- mum and the larger to the current maximum, at a cost of 3 comparisons for every 2 elements. How you set up initial values for the current minimum and maximum depends on whether n is odd or even. If n is odd, set both the minimum and maximum to the value of the ûrst element, and then process the rest of the elements in pairs. If n is even, perform 1 comparison on the ûrst 2 elements to determine the initial values of the minimum and maximum, and then process the rest of the elements in pairs as in the case for odd n. Let’s count the total number of comparisons. If n is odd, then 3 bn=2c com- parisons occur. If n is even, 1 initial comparison occurs, followed by another 3.n  2/=2 comparisons, for a total of 3n=2  2. Thus, in either case, the total number of comparisons is at most 3 bn=2c. Exercises 9.1-1 Show that the second smallest of n elements can be found with n C dlg ne  2 comparisons in the worst case. (Hint: Also ûnd the smallest element.) 9.1-2 Given n > 2 distinct numbers, you want to ûnd a number that is neither the min- imum nor the maximum. What is the smallest number of comparisons that you need to perform? 9.1-3 A racetrack can run races with ûve horses at a time to determine their relative speeds. For 25 horses, it takes six races to determine the fastest horse, assum- ing transitivity (see page 1159). What’s the minimum number of races it takes to determine the fastest three horses out of 25? ? 9.1-4 Prove the lower bound of d3n=2e  2 comparisons in the worst case to ûnd both the maximum and minimum of n numbers. (Hint: Consider how many numbers are potentially either the maximum or minimum, and investigate how a comparison affects these counts.) 230 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics 9.2 Selection in expected linear time The general selection problem4ûnding the i th order statistic for any value of i 4 appears more difûcult than the simple problem of ûnding a minimum. Yet, sur- prisingly, the asymptotic running time for both problems is the same: ‚.n/. This section presents a divide-and-conquer algorithm for the selection problem. The al- gorithm RANDOMIZED-SELECT is modeled after the quicksort algorithm of Chap- ter 7. Like quicksort it partitions the input array recursively. But unlike quicksort, which recursively processes both sides of the partition, R ANDOMIZED-SELECT works on only one side of the partition. This difference shows up in the analysis: whereas quicksort has an expected running time of ‚.n lg n/, the expected running time of RANDOMIZED-SELECT is ‚.n/, assuming that the elements are distinct. RANDOMIZED-SELECT uses the procedure RANDOMIZED-PARTITION intro- duced in Section 7.3. Like RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, it is a randomized algo- rithm, since its behavior is determined in part by the output of a random-number generator. The RANDOMIZED-SELECT procedure returns the i th smallest element of the array AŒp W r�, where 1 හ i හ r  p C 1. RANDOMIZED-SELECT .A; p; r; i / 1 if p == r 2 return AŒp� // 1 හ i හ r  p C 1 when p == r means that i D 1 3 q D RANDOMIZED-PARTITION .A; p; r/ 4 k D q  p C 1 5 if i == k 6 return AŒq� // the pivot value is the answer 7 elseif i < k 8 return RANDOMIZED-SELECT .A; p; q  1; i / 9 else return RANDOMIZED-SELECT .A; q C 1; r; i  k/ Figure 9.1 illustrates how the RANDOMIZED-SELECT procedure works. Line 1 checks for the base case of the recursion, in which the subarray AŒp W r� consists of just one element. In this case, i must equal 1, and line 2 simply returns AŒp� as the i th smallest element. Otherwise, the call to RANDOMIZED-PARTITION in line 3 partitions the array AŒp W r� into two (possibly empty) subarrays AŒp W q  1� and AŒq C 1 W r� such that each element of AŒp W q  1� is less than or equal to AŒq�, which in turn is less than each element of AŒq C 1 W r�. (Although our analysis assumes that the elements are distinct, the procedure still yields the correct result even if equal elements are present.) As in quicksort, we’ll refer to AŒq� as the pivot element.

The subarray AŒp W r� in each recursive step is shown in tan, with the dark tan element selected as the pivot for the next partitioning. Blue elements are outside AŒp W r�. The answer is the tan element in the bottom array, where p D r D 5 and i D 1. The array designations A .0/ ; A .1/ ; : : : ; A .5/ , the partitioning numbers, and whether the partitioning is helpful are explained on the following page. the number of elements in the low side of the partition, plus 1 for the pivot element. Line 5 then checks whether AŒq� is the i th smallest element. If it is, then line 6 returns AŒq�. Otherwise, the algorithm determines in which of the two subarrays AŒp W q  1� and AŒq C 1 W r� the i th smallest element lies. If i < k, then the desired element lies on the low side of the partition, and line 8 recursively selects it from the subarray. If i > k, however, then the desired element lies on the high side of the partition. Since we already know k values that are smaller than the i th smallest element of AŒp W r�4namely, the elements of AŒp W q�4the desired element is the .i  k/th smallest element of AŒq C 1 W r�, which line 9 ûnds recursively. The code appears to allow recursive calls to subarrays with 0 elements, but Exercise 9.2-1 asks you to show that this situation cannot happen. The worst-case running time for RANDOMIZED-SELECT is ‚.n 2 /, even to ûnd the minimum, because it could be extremely unlucky and always partition around the largest remaining element before identifying the i th smallest when only one element remains. In this worst case, each recursive step removes only the pivot from consideration. Because partitioning n elements takes ‚.n/ time, the recurrence for the worst-case running time is the same as for QUICKSORT: 232 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics T .n/ D T .n  1/ C ‚.n/, with the solution T .n/ D ‚.n 2 /. We’ll see that the al- gorithm has a linear expected running time, however, and because it is randomized, no particular input elicits the worst-case behavior. To see the intuition behind the linear expected running time, suppose that each time the algorithm randomly selects a pivot element, the pivot lies somewhere within the second and third quartiles4the <middle half=4of the remaining ele- ments in sorted order. If the i th smallest element is less than the pivot, then all the elements greater than the pivot are ignored in all future recursive calls. These ignored elements include at least the uppermost quartile, and possibly more. Like- wise, if the i th smallest element is greater than the pivot, then all the elements less than the pivot4at least the ûrst quartile4are ignored in all future recursive calls. Either way, therefore, at least 1=4 of the remaining elements are ignored in all future recursive calls, leaving at most 3=4 of the remaining elements in play: residing in the subarray AŒp W r�. Since RANDOMIZED-PARTITION takes ‚.n/ time on a subarray of n elements, the recurrence for the worst-case running time is T .n/ D T .3n=4/ C ‚.n/. By case 3 of the master method (Theorem 4.1 on page 102), this recurrence has solution T .n/ D ‚.n/. Of course, the pivot does not necessarily fall into the middle half every time. Since the pivot is selected at random, the probability that it falls into the middle half is about 1=2 each time. We can view the process of selecting the pivot as a Bernoulli trial (see Section C.4) with success equating to the pivot residing in the middle half. Thus the expected number of trials needed for success is given by a geometric distribution: just two trials on average (equation (C.36) on page 1197). In other words, we expect that half of the partitionings reduce the number of ele- ments still in play by at least 3=4 and that half of the partitionings do not help as much. Consequently, the expected number of partitionings at most doubles from the case when the pivot always falls into the middle half. The cost of each extra partitioning is less than the one that preceded it, so that the expected running time is still ‚.n/. To make the above argument rigorous, we start by deûning the random vari- able A .j / as the set of elements of A that are still in play after j partitionings (that is, within the subarray AŒp W r� after j calls of RANDOMIZED-SELECT), so that A .0/ consists of all the elements in A. Since each partitioning removes at least one element4the pivot4from being in play, the sequence jA .0/ j; jA .1/ j; jA .2/ j; : : : strictly decreases. Set A .j 1/ is in play before the j th partitioning, and set A .j / remains in play afterward. For convenience, assume that the initial set A .0/ is the result of a 0th <dummy= partitioning. Let’s call the j th partitioning helpful if jA .j / j හ .3=4/jA .j 1/ j. Figure 9.1 shows the sets A .j / and whether partitionings are helpful for an example array. A helpful partitioning corresponds to a successful Bernoulli trial. The following lemma shows that a partitioning is at least as likely to be helpful as not. 9.2 Selection in expected linear time 233 Lemma 9.1 A partitioning is helpful with probability at least 1=2. Proof Whether a partitioning is helpful depends on the randomly chosen pivot. We discussed the <middle half= in the informal argument above. Let’s more pre- cisely deûne the middle half of an n-element subarray as all but the smallest dn=4e  1 and greatest dn=4e  1 elements (that is, all but the ûrst dn=4e  1 and last dn=4e  1 elements if the subarray were sorted). We’ll prove that if the pivot falls into the middle half, then the pivot leads to a helpful partitioning, and we’ll also prove that the probability of the pivot falling into the middle half is at least 1=2. Regardless of where the pivot falls, either all the elements greater than it or all the elements less than it, along with the pivot itself, will no longer be in play after partitioning. If the pivot falls into the middle half, therefore, at least dn=4e  1 elements less than the pivot or dn=4e  1 elements greater than the pivot, plus the pivot, will no longer be in play after partitioning. That is, at least dn=4e ele- ments will no longer be in play. The number of elements remaining in play will be at most n  dn=4e, which equals b3n=4c by Exercise 3.3-2 on page 70. Since b3n=4c හ 3n=4, the partitioning is helpful. To determine a lower bound on the probability that a randomly chosen pivot falls into the middle half, we determine an upper bound on the probability that it does not. That probability is 2.dn=4e  1/ n හ 2..n=4 C 1/  1/ n (by inequality (3.2) on page 64) D n=2 n D 1=2 : Thus, the pivot has a probability of at least 1=2 of falling into the middle half, and so the probability is at least 1=2 that a partitioning is helpful. We can now bound the expected running time of R ANDOMIZED-SELECT. Theorem 9.2 The procedure RANDOMIZED-SELECT on an input array of n distinct elements has an expected running time of ‚.n/. Proof Since not every partitioning is necessarily helpful, let’s give each parti- tioning an index starting at 0 and denote by hh 0 ; h 1 ; h 2 ; : : : ; h m i the sequence of partitionings that are helpful, so that the h k th partitioning is helpful for k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; m. Although the number m of helpful partitionings is a random vari- 234 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics … … … generation 0 generation 1 generation k … … A .0/ A .1/ A .2/ A .h 1 1/ A .h 1 / A .h 1 C1/ A .h 1 C2/ A .h 2 1/ A .h 2 / A .h k 1/ A .h k / A .h k C1/ A .h k C2/ A .h kC1 1/ A .h kC1 / A .hm/ Figure 9.2 The sets within each generation in the proof of Theorem 9.2. Vertical lines represent the sets, with the height of each line indicating the size of the set, which equals the number of elements in play. Each generation starts with a set A .h k / , which is the result of a helpful partitioning. These sets are drawn in black and are at most 3=4 the size of the sets to their immediate left. Sets drawn in orange are not the ûrst within a generation. A generation may contain just one set. The sets in generation k are A .h k / ; A .h k C1/ ; : : : ; A .h kC1 1/ . The sets A .h k / are deûned so that jA .h k / j හ .3=4/jA .h k1 / j. If the partitioning gets all the way to generation h m , set A .h m / has at most one element in play. able, we can bound it, since after at most dlog 4=3 ne helpful partitionings, only one element remains in play. Consider the dummy 0th partitioning as helpful, so that h 0 D 0. Denote jA .h k / j by n k , where n 0 D jA .0/ j is the original problem size. Since the h k th partitioning is helpful and the sizes of the sets A .j / strictly decrease, we have n k D jA .h k / j හ .3=4/jA .h k 1/ j D .3=4/ n k1 for k D 1; 2; : : : ; m. By iterating n k හ .3=4/ n k1 , we have that n k හ .3=4/ k n 0 for k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; m. As Figure 9.2 depicts, we break up the sequence of sets A .j / into m genera- tions consisting of consecutively partitioned sets, starting with the result A .h k / of a helpful partitioning and ending with the last set A .h kC1 1/ before the next help- ful partitioning, so that the sets in generation k are A .h k / ; A .h k C1/ ; : : : ; A .h kC1 1/ . Then for each set of elements A .j / in the kth generation, we have that jA .j / j හ jA .h k / j D n k හ .3=4/ k n 0 . Next, we deûne the random variable X k D h kC1  h k for k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; m  1. That is, X k is the number of sets in the kth generation, so that the sets in the kth generation are A .h k / ; A .h k C1/ ; : : : ; A .h k CX k 1/ . By Lemma 9.1, the probability that a partitioning is helpful is at least 1=2. The probability is actually even higher, since a partitioning is helpful even if the pivot 9.2 Selection in expected linear time 235 does not fall into the middle half but the i th smallest element happens to lie in the smaller side of the partitioning. We’ll just use the lower bound of 1=2, however, and then equation (C.36) gives that E ŒX k � හ 2 for k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; m  1. Let’s derive an upper bound on how many comparisons are made altogether dur- ing partitioning, since the running time is dominated by the comparisons. Since we are calculating an upper bound, assume that the recursion goes all the way un- til only one element remains in play. The j th partitioning takes the set A .j 1/ of elements in play, and it compares the randomly chosen pivot with all the other jA .j 1/ j  1 elements, so that the j th partitioning makes fewer than jA .j 1/ j comparisons. The sets in the kth generation have sizes jA .h k / j; jA .h k C1/ j; : : : ; jA .h k CX k 1/ j. Thus, the total number of comparisons during partitioning is less than 1 X kD0 h k CX k 1 X j Dh k jA .j / j හ m1 X kD0 h k CX k 1 X j Dh k jA .h k / j D m1 X kD0 X k jA .h k / j හ m1 X kD0 X k Ï 3 4 Ð k n 0 : Since E ŒX k � හ 2, we have that the expected total number of comparisons during partitioning is less than E \" m1 X kD0 X k Ï 3 4 Ð k n 0 # D m1 X kD0 E \" X k Ï 3 4 Ð k n 0 # (by linearity of expectation) D n 0 m1 X kD0 Ï 3 4 Ð k E ŒX k � හ 2n 0 m1 X kD0 Ï 3 4 Ð k < 2n 0 1 X kD0 Ï 3 4 Ð k D 8n 0 (by equation (A.7) on page 1142) . Since n 0 is the size of the original array A, we conclude that the expected num- ber of comparisons, and thus the expected running time, for R ANDOMIZED- SELECT is O.n/. All n elements are examined in the ûrst call of RANDOMIZED- 236 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics PARTITION, giving a lower bound of �.n/. Hence the expected running time is ‚.n/. Exercises 9.2-1 Show that RANDOMIZED-SELECT never makes a recursive call to a 0-length array. 9.2-2 Write an iterative version of RANDOMIZED-SELECT. 9.2-3 Suppose that RANDOMIZED-SELECT is used to select the minimum element of the array A D h2; 3; 0; 5; 7; 9; 1; 8; 6; 4i. Describe a sequence of partitions that results in a worst-case performance of RANDOMIZED-SELECT. 9.2-4 Argue that the expected running time of RANDOMIZED-SELECT does not depend on the order of the elements in its input array AŒp W r�. That is, the expected running time is the same for any permutation of the input array AŒp W r�. (Hint: Argue by induction on the length n of the input array.) 9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time We’ll now examine a remarkable and theoretically interesting selection algorithm whose running time is ‚.n/ in the worst case. Although the RANDOMIZED- SELECT algorithm from Section 9.2 achieves linear expected time, we saw that its running time in the worst case was quadratic. The selection algorithm presented in this section achieves linear time in the worst case, but it is not nearly as practical as RANDOMIZED-SELECT. It is mostly of theoretical interest. Like the expected linear-time RANDOMIZED-SELECT, the worst-case linear- time algorithm SELECT ûnds the desired element by recursively partitioning the input array. Unlike RANDOMIZED-SELECT, however, SELECT guarantees a good split by choosing a provably good pivot when partitioning the array. The cleverness in the algorithm is that it ûnds the pivot recursively. Thus, there are two invocations of SELECT: one to ûnd a good pivot, and a second to recursively ûnd the desired order statistic. The partitioning algorithm used by SELECT is like the deterministic partitioning algorithm PARTITION from quicksort (see Section 7.1), but modiûed to take the element to partition around as an additional input parameter. Like PARTITION, the 9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time 237 PARTITION-AROUND algorithm returns the index of the pivot. Since it’s so similar to PARTITION, the pseudocode for PARTITION-AROUND is omitted. The SELECT procedure takes as input a subarray AŒp W r ] of n D r  p C 1 elements and an integer i in the range 1 හ i හ n. It returns the i th smallest element of A. The pseudocode is actually more understandable than it might appear at ûrst.

The while loop executes 0 to 4 times, each time rearranging the elements of AŒp W r� so that AŒp� contains the minimum element. If i D 1, which means that we actually want the minimum element, then the procedure simply returns it in line 7. Otherwise, SELECT eliminates the minimum from the subarray AŒp W r� and iterates to ûnd the .i  1/st element in AŒp C 1 W r�. Lines 9310 do so by incrementing p and decrementing i . If the while loop completes all of its iterations without returning a 238 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics x g dg=2e bg=2c C 1 Figure 9.3 The relationships between elements (shown as circles) immediately after line 17 of the selection algorithm S ELECT. There are g D .r  p C 1/=5 groups of 5 elements, each of which oc- cupies a column. For example, the leftmost column contains elements AŒp�, AŒp C g�, AŒp C 2g�, AŒp C 3g�, AŒp C 4g�, and the next column contains AŒp C 1�, AŒp C g C 1�, AŒp C 2g C 1�, AŒp C 3g C 1�, AŒp C 4g C 1�. The medians of the groups are red, and the pivot x is labeled. Arrows go from smaller elements to larger. The elements on the blue background are all known to be less than or equal to x and cannot fall into the high side of the partition around x. The elements on the yellow background are known to be greater than or equal to x and cannot fall into the low side of the partition around x. The pivot x belongs to both the blue and yellow regions and is shown on a green background. The elements on the white background could lie on either side of the partition. result, the procedure executes the core of the algorithm in lines 11324, assured that the number r  p C 1 of elements in AŒp W r� is evenly divisible by 5. The next part of the algorithm implements the following idea, illustrated in Fig- ure 9.3. Divide the elements in AŒp W r� into g D .r p C1/=5 groups of 5 elements each. The ûrst 5-element group is hAŒp�; AŒp C g�; AŒp C 2g�; AŒp C 3g�; AŒp C 4g�i ; the second is AŒp C 1�; AŒp C g C 1�; AŒp C 2g C 1�; AŒp C 3g C 1�; AŒp C 4g C 1�i ; and so forth until the last, which is AŒp C g  1�; AŒp C 2g  1�; AŒp C 3g  1�; AŒp C 4g  1�; AŒr�i : (Note that r D p C 5g  1.) Line 13 puts each group in order using, for example, insertion sort (Section 2.1), so that for j D p; p C 1; : : : ; p C g  1, we have 9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time 239 AŒj � හ AŒj C g� හ AŒj C 2g� හ AŒj C 3g� හ AŒj C 4g� : Each vertical column in Figure 9.3 depicts a sorted group of 5 elements. The median of each 5-element group is AŒj C 2g�, and thus all the 5-element medians, shown in red, lie in the range AŒp C 2g W p C 3g  1�. Next, line 16 determines the pivot x by recursively calling SELECT to ûnd the median (speciûcally, the dg=2eth smallest) of the g group medians. Line 17 uses the modiûed PARTITION-AROUND algorithm to partition the elements of AŒp W r� around x , returning the index q of x , so that AŒq� D x , elements in AŒp W q� are all at most x , and elements in AŒq W r� are greater than or equal to x . The remainder of the code mirrors that of RANDOMIZED-SELECT . If the pivot x is the i th largest, the procedure returns it. Otherwise, the procedure recursively calls itself on either AŒp W q  1� or AŒq C 1 W r�, depending on the value of i . Let’s analyze the running time of SELECT and see how the judicious choice of the pivot x plays into a guarantee on its worst-case running time. Theorem 9.3 The running time of SELECT on an input of n elements is ‚.n/. Proof Deûne T .n/ as the worst-case time to run SELECT on any input subarray AŒp W r� of size at most n, that is, for which r  p C 1 හ n. By this deûnition, T .n/ is monotonically increasing. We ûrst determine an upper bound on the time spent outside the recursive calls in lines 16, 23, and 24. The while loop in lines 1310 executes 0 to 4 times, which is O.1/ times. Since the dominant time within the loop is the computa- tion of the minimum in lines 234, which takes ‚.n/ time, lines 1310 execute in O.1/  ‚.n/ D O.n/ time. The sorting of the 5-element groups in lines 12313 takes ‚.n/ time because each 5-element group takes ‚.1/ time to sort (even using an asymptotically inefûcient sorting algorithm such as insertion sort), and there are g elements to sort, where n=5  1 < g හ n=5. Finally, the time to partition in line 17 is ‚.n/, as Exercise 7.1-3 on page 187 asks you to show. Because the re- maining bookkeeping only costs ‚.1/ time, the total amount of time spent outside of the recursive calls is O.n/ C ‚.n/ C ‚.n/ C ‚.1/ D ‚.n/. Now let’s determine the running time for the recursive calls. The recursive call to ûnd the pivot in line 16 takes T .g/ හ T .n=5/ time, since g හ n=5 and T .n/ monotonically increases. Of the two recursive calls in lines 23 and 24, at most one is executed. But we’ll see that no matter which of these two recursive calls to SELECT actually executes, the number of elements in the recursive call turns out to be at most 7n=10, and hence the worst-case cost for lines 23 and 24 is at most T .7n=10/. Let’s now show that the machinations with group medians and the choice of the pivot x as the median of the group medians guarantees this property. 240 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics Figure 9.3 helps to visualize what’s going on. There are g හ n=5 groups of 5 el- ements, with each group shown as a column sorted from bottom to top. The arrows show the ordering of elements within the columns. The columns are ordered from left to right with groups to the left of x ’s group having a group median less than x and those to the right of x ’s group having a group median greater than x . Although the relative order within each group matters, the relative order among groups to the left of x ’s column doesn’t really matter, and neither does the relative order among groups to the right of x ’s column. The important thing is that the groups to the left have group medians less than x (shown by the horizontal arrows entering x ), and that the groups to the right have group medians greater than x (shown by the horizontal arrows leaving x ). Thus, the yellow region contains elements that we know are greater than or equal to x , and the blue region contains elements that we know are less than or equal to x . These two regions each contain at least 3g=2 elements. The number of group medians in the yellow region is bg=2c C 1, and for each group median, two ad- ditional elements are greater than it, making a total of 3.bg=2c C 1/  3g=2 elements. Similarly, the number of group medians in the blue region is dg=2e, and for each group median, two additional elements are less than it, making a total of 3 dg=2e  3g=2. The elements in the yellow region cannot fall into the low side of the partition around x , and those in the blue region cannot fall into the high side. The elements in neither region4those lying on a white background4could fall into either side of the partition. But since the low side of the partition excludes the elements in the yellow region, and there are a total of 5g elements, we know that the low side of the partition can contain at most 5g  3g=2 D 7g=2 හ 7n=10 elements. Likewise, the high side of the partition excludes the elements in the blue region, and a similar calculation shows that it also contains at most 7n=10 elements. All of which leads to the following recurrence for the worst-case running time of SELECT: T .n/ හ T .n=5/ C T .7n=10/ C ‚.n/ : (9.1) We can show that T .n/ D O.n/ by substitution. 2 More speciûcally, we’ll prove that T .n/ හ cn for some suitably large constant c > 0 and all n > 0. Substituting this inductive hypothesis into the right-hand side of recurrence (9.1) and assuming that n  5 yields 2 We could also use the Akra-Bazzi method from Section 4.7, which involves calculus, to solve this recurrence. Indeed, a similar recurrence (4.24) on page 117 was used to illustrate that method. 9.3 Selection in worst-case linear time 241 T .n/ හ c.n=5/ C c.7n=10/ C ‚.n/ හ 9cn=10 C ‚.n/ D cn  cn=10 C ‚.n/ හ cn if c is chosen large enough that c=10 dominates the upper-bound constant hidden by the ‚.n/. In addition to this constraint, we can pick c large enough that T .n/ හ cn for all n හ 4, which is the base case of the recursion within SELECT. The running time of SELECT is therefore O.n/ in the worst case, and because line 13 alone takes ‚.n/ time, the total time is ‚.n/. As in a comparison sort (see Section 8.1), SELECT and RANDOMIZED-SELECT determine information about the relative order of elements only by comparing ele- ments. Recall from Chapter 8 that sorting requires �.n lg n/ time in the compari- son model, even on average (see Problem 8-1). The linear-time sorting algorithms in Chapter 8 make assumptions about the type of the input. In contrast, the linear- time selection algorithms in this chapter do not require any assumptions about the input’s type, only that the elements are distinct and can be pairwise compared ac- cording to a linear order. The algorithms in this chapter are not subject to the �.n lg n/ lower bound, because they manage to solve the selection problem with- out sorting all the elements. Thus, solving the selection problem by sorting and indexing, as presented in the introduction to this chapter, is asymptotically inefû- cient in the comparison model. Exercises 9.3-1 In the algorithm SELECT, the input elements are divided into groups of 5. Show that the algorithm works in linear time if the input elements are divided into groups of 7 instead of 5. 9.3-2 Suppose that the preprocessing in lines 1310 of S ELECT is replaced by a base case for n  n 0 , where n 0 is a suitable constant; that g is chosen as br  p C 1/=5c; and that the elements in AŒ5g W n� belong to no group. Show that although the recurrence for the running time becomes messier, it still solves to ‚.n/. 9.3-3 Show how to use SELECT as a subroutine to make quicksort run in O.n lg n/ time in the worst case, assuming that all elements are distinct. 242 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics Figure 9.4 Professor Olay needs to determine the position of the east-west oil pipeline that mini- mizes the total length of the north-south spurs. ? 9.3-4 Suppose that an algorithm uses only comparisons to ûnd the i th smallest element in a set of n elements. Show that it can also ûnd the i  1 smaller elements and the n  i larger elements without performing any additional comparisons. 9.3-5 Show how to determine the median of a 5-element set using only 6 comparisons. 9.3-6 You have a <black-box= worst-case linear-time median subroutine. Give a sim- ple, linear-time algorithm that solves the selection problem for an arbitrary order statistic. 9.3-7 Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running east to west through an oil ûeld of n wells. The company wants to connect a spur pipeline from each well directly to the main pipeline along a shortest route (either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.4. Given the x - and y -coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick an optimal location of the main pipeline to minimize the total length of the spurs? Show how to determine an optimal location in linear time. 9.3-8 The kth quantiles of an n-element set are the k  1 order statistics that divide the sorted set into k equal-sized sets (to within 1). Give an O.n lg k/-time algorithm to list the kth quantiles of a set. Problems for Chapter 9 243 9.3-9 Describe an O.n/-time algorithm that, given a set S of n distinct numbers and a positive integer k හ n, determines the k numbers in S that are closest to the median of S . 9.3-10 Let X Œ1 W n� and Y Œ1 W n� be two arrays, each containing n numbers already in sorted order. Give an O.lg n/-time algorithm to ûnd the median of all 2n elements in arrays X and Y . Assume that all 2n numbers are distinct. Problems 9-1 Largest i numbers in sorted order You are given a set of n numbers, and you wish to ûnd the i largest in sorted order using a comparison-based algorithm.

Sort the numbers, and list the i largest. b. Build a max-priority queue from the numbers, and call EXTRACT-MAX i times. c. Use an order-statistic algorithm to ûnd the i th largest number, partition around that number, and sort the i largest numbers. 9-2 Variant of randomized selection Professor Mendel has proposed simplifying R ANDOMIZED-SELECT by eliminat- ing the check for whether i and k are equal. The simpliûed procedure is SIMPLER- RANDOMIZED-SELECT.

Argue that in the worst case, SIMPLER-RANDOMIZED-SELECT never termi- nates. b. Prove that the expected running time of SIMPLER-RANDOMIZED-SELECT is still O.n/. 9-3 Weighted median Consider n elements x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n with positive weights w 1 ; w 2 ; : : : ; w n such that P n i D1 w i D 1. The weighted (lower) median is an element x k satisfying X x i <x k w i < 1 2 and X x i >x k w i හ 1 2 : For example, consider the following elements x i and weights w i : i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x i 3 8 2 5 4 1 6 w i 0:12 0:35 0:025 0:08 0:15 0:075 0:2 For these elements, the median is x 5 D 4, but the weighted median is x 7 D 6. To see why the weighted median is x 7 , observe that the elements less than x 7 are x 1 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 , and x 6 , and the sum w 1 C w 3 C w 4 C w 5 C w 6 D 0:45, which is less than 1=2. Furthermore, only element x 2 is greater than x 7 , and w 2 D 0:35, which is no greater than 1=2. a.

Show how to compute the weighted median in ‚.n/ worst-case time using a linear-time median algorithm such as S ELECT from Section 9.3. The post-ofûce location problem is deûned as follows. The input is n points p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n with associated weights w 1 ; w 2 ; : : : ; w n . A solution is a point p (not necessarily one of the input points) that minimizes the sum P n i D1 w i d.p; p i /, where d.a; b/ is the distance between points a and b. Problems for Chapter 9 245 d. Argue that the weighted median is a best solution for the one-dimensional post- ofûce location problem, in which points are simply real numbers and the dis- tance between points a and b is d.a; b/ D ja  bj. e. Find the best solution for the two-dimensional post-ofûce location problem, in which the points are .x; y/ coordinate pairs and the distance between points a D .x 1 ; y 1 / and b D .x 2 ; y 2 / is the Manhattan distance given by d.a; b/ D jx 1  x 2 j C jy 1  y 2 j. 9-4 Small order statistics Let’s denote by S.n/ the worst-case number of comparisons used by S ELECT to select the i th order statistic from n numbers. Although S.n/ D ‚.n/, the constant hidden by the ‚-notation is rather large. When i is small relative to n, there is an algorithm that uses SELECT as a subroutine but makes fewer comparisons in the worst case. a. Describe an algorithm that uses U i .n/ comparisons to ûnd the i th smallest of n elements, where i .n/ D ( S.n/ if i  n=2 ; bn=2c C U i .dn=2e/ C S.2i / otherwise : (Hint: Begin with bn=2c disjoint pairwise comparisons, and recurse on the set containing the smaller element from each pair.) b. Show that, if i < n=2, then U i .n/ D n C O.S.2i / lg.n=i //. c. Show that if i is a constant less than n=2, then U i .n/ D n C O.lg n/. d. Show that if i D n=k for k  2, then U i .n/ D n C O.S.2n=k/ lg k/. 9-5 Alternative analysis of randomized selection In this problem, you will use indicator random variables to analyze the proce- dure RANDOMIZED-SELECT in a manner akin to our analysis of R ANDOMIZED- QUICKSORT in Section 7.4.2. As in the quicksort analysis, we assume that all elements are distinct, and we rename the elements of the input array A as ´ 1 ; ´ 2 ; : : : ; ´ n , where ´ i is the i th smallest element. Thus the call RANDOMIZED-SELECT .A; 1; n; i / returns ´ i . For 1 හ j < k හ n, let X ij k D I f ´ j is compared with ´ k sometime during the execution of the algorithm to ûnd ´ i g : 246 Chapter 9 Medians and Order Statistics a.

Conclude that, assuming all elements of array A are distinct, RANDOMIZED- SELECT runs in O.n/ expected time. 9-6 Select with groups of 3 Exercise 9.3-1 asks you to show that the SELECT algorithm still runs in linear time if the elements are divided into groups of 7. This problem asks about dividing into groups of 3. a. Show that SELECT runs in linear time if you divide the elements into groups whose size is any odd constant greater than 3. b. Show that SELECT runs in O.n lg n/ time if you divide the elements into groups of size 3. Because the bound in part (b) is just an upper bound, we do not know whether the groups-of-3 strategy actually runs in O.n/ time. But by repeating the groups- of-3 idea on the middle group of medians, we can pick a pivot that guarantees O.n/ time. The SELECT3 algorithm on the next page determines the i th smallest of an input array of n > 1 distinct elements. c. Describe in English how the SELECT3 algorithm works. Include in your de- scription one or more suitable diagrams. d. Show that SELECT3 runs in O.n/ time in the worst case. Chapter notes The worst-case linear-time median-ûnding algorithm was devised by Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan [62]. The fast randomized version is due to Hoare [218]. Floyd and Rivest [147] have developed an improved randomized version that parti- tions around an element recursively selected from a small sample of the elements.

Bent and John [48] gave a lower bound of 2n comparisons for median ûnding, and Sch¨ onhage, Paterson, and Pippenger [397] gave an upper bound of 3n. Dor and Zwick have improved on both of these bounds. Their upper bound [123] is slightly less than 2:95n, and their lower bound [124] is .2 C �/n, for a small positive constant � , thereby improving slightly on related work by Dor et al. [122]. Paterson [354] describes some of these results along with other related work. Problem 9-6 was inspired by a paper by Chen and Dumitrescu [84]. Part III Data Structures Introduction Sets are as fundamental to computer science as they are to mathematics. Whereas mathematical sets are unchanging, the sets manipulated by algorithms can grow, shrink, or otherwise change over time. We call such sets dynamic. The next four chapters present some basic techniques for representing ûnite dynamic sets and manipulating them on a computer. Algorithms may require several types of operations to be performed on sets. For example, many algorithms need only the ability to insert elements into, delete el- ements from, and test membership in a set. We call a dynamic set that supports these operations a dictionary. Other algorithms require more complicated opera- tions. For example, min-priority queues, which Chapter 6 introduced in the context of the heap data structure, support the operations of inserting an element into and extracting the smallest element from a set. The best way to implement a dynamic set depends upon the operations that you need to support. Elements of a dynamic set In a typical implementation of a dynamic set, each element is represented by an object whose attributes can be examined and manipulated given a pointer to the object. Some kinds of dynamic sets assume that one of the object’s attributes is an identifying key. If the keys are all different, we can think of the dynamic set as being a set of key values. The object may contain satellite data, which are carried around in other object attributes but are otherwise unused by the set implementa- tion. It may also have attributes that are manipulated by the set operations. These attributes may contain data or pointers to other objects in the set. Some dynamic sets presuppose that the keys are drawn from a totally ordered set, such as the real numbers, or the set of all words under the usual alphabetic 250 Part III Data Structures ordering. A total ordering allows us to deûne the minimum element of the set, for example, or to speak of the next element larger than a given element in a set. Operations on dynamic sets Operations on a dynamic set can be grouped into two categories: queries, which simply return information about the set, and modifying operations, which change the set. Here is a list of typical operations. Any speciûc application will usually require only a few of these to be implemented. SEARCH.S; k/ A query that, given a set S and a key value k, returns a pointer x to an element in S such that x: key D k, or NIL if no such element belongs to S . I NSERT.S; x/ A modifying operation that adds the element pointed to by x to the set S . We usually assume that any attributes in element x needed by the set implementa- tion have already been initialized. DELETE .S; x/ A modifying operation that, given a pointer x to an element in the set S , re- moves x from S . (Note that this operation takes a pointer to an element x , not a key value.) MINIMUM.S/ and MAXIMUM.S/ Queries on a totally ordered set S that return a pointer to the element of S with the smallest (for MINIMUM) or largest (for MAXIMUM) key. SUCCESSOR.S; x/ A query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S , returns a pointer to the next larger element in S , or NIL if x is the maximum element. PREDECESSOR .S; x/ A query that, given an element x whose key is from a totally ordered set S , returns a pointer to the next smaller element in S , or NIL if x is the minimum element. In some situations, we can extend the queries SUCCESSOR and PREDECESSOR so that they apply to sets with nondistinct keys. For a set on n keys, the normal presumption is that a call to MINIMUM followed by n  1 calls to SUCCESSOR enumerates the elements in the set in sorted order. We usually measure the time taken to execute a set operation in terms of the size of the set. For example, Chapter 13 describes a data structure that can support any of the operations listed above on a set of size n in O.lg n/ time. Part III Data Structures 251 Of course, you can always choose to implement a dynamic set with an array. The advantage of doing so is that the algorithms for the dynamic-set operations are simple. The downside, however, is that many of these operations have a worst- case running time of ‚.n/. If the array is not sorted, I NSERT and DELETE can take ‚.1/ time, but the remaining operations take ‚.n/ time. If instead the ar- ray is maintained in sorted order, then MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR take ‚.1/ time; SEARCH takes O.lg n/ time if implemented with binary search; but I NSERT and DELETE take ‚.n/ time in the worst case. The data structures studied in this part improve on the array implementation for many of the dynamic-set operations. Overview of Part III Chapters 10313 describe several data structures that we can use to implement dy- namic sets. We’ll use many of these data structures later to construct efûcient algo- rithms for a variety of problems. We already saw another important data structure 4the heap4in Chapter 6. Chapter 10 presents the essentials of working with simple data structures such as arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees. If you have taken an introductory programming course, then much of this material should be familiar to you. Chapter 11 introduces hash tables, a widely used data structure supporting the dictionary operations I NSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH. In the worst case, hash ta- bles require ‚.n/ time to perform a SEARCH operation, but the expected time for hash-table operations is O.1/. We rely on probability to analyze hash-table opera- tions, but you can understand how the operations work even without probability. Binary search trees, which are covered in Chapter 12, support all the dynamic- set operations listed above. In the worst case, each operation takes ‚.n/ time on a tree with n elements. Binary search trees serve as the basis for many other data structures. Chapter 13 introduces red-black trees, which are a variant of binary search trees. Unlike ordinary binary search trees, red-black trees are guaranteed to perform well: operations take O.lg n/ time in the worst case. A red-black tree is a balanced search tree. Chapter 18 in Part V presents another kind of balanced search tree, called a B-tree. Although the mechanics of red-black trees are somewhat intricate, you can glean most of their properties from the chapter without studying the mechanics in detail. Nevertheless, you probably will ûnd walking through the code to be instructive. 10 Elementary Data Structures In this chapter, we examine the representation of dynamic sets by simple data struc- tures that use pointers. Although you can construct many complex data structures using pointers, we present only the rudimentary ones: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees. 10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues 10.1.1 Arrays We assume that, as in most programming languages, an array is stored as a con- tiguous sequence of bytes in memory. If the ûrst element of an array has index s (for example, in an array with 1-origin indexing, s D 1), the array starts at memory address a, and each array element occupies b bytes, then the i th element occupies bytes a C b.i  s/ through a C b.i  s C 1/  1. Since most of the arrays in this book are indexed starting at 1, and a few starting at 0, we can simplify these formulas a little. When s D 1, the i th element occupies bytes a C b.i  1/ through a C bi  1, and when s D 0, the i th element occupies bytes a C bi through a C b.i C 1/  1. Assuming that the computer can access all memory locations in the same amount of time (as in the RAM model described in Section 2.2), it takes constant time to access any array element, regardless of the index. Most programming languages require each element of a particular array to be the same size. If the elements of a given array might occupy different numbers of bytes, then the above formulas fail to apply, since the element size b is not a constant. In such cases, the array elements are usually objects of varying sizes, and what actually appears in each array element is a pointer to the object. The number of bytes occupied by a pointer is typically the same, no matter what the pointer references, so that to access an object in an array, the above formulas give the address of the pointer to the object and then the pointer must be followed to access the object itself. 10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues 253 1 2 3 4 5 6 (a) 1 4 2 5 3 6 (b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 (c) 2 5 3 6 1 4 (d) Figure 10.1 Four ways to store the 2  3 matrix M from equation (10.1). (a) In row-major order, in a single array. (b) In column-major order, in a single array. (c) In row-major order, with one array per row (tan) and a single array (blue) of pointers to the row arrays. (d) In column-major order, with one array per column (tan) and a single array (blue) of pointers to the column arrays. 10.1.2 Matrices We typically represent a matrix or two-dimensional array by one or more one- dimensional arrays. The two most common ways to store a matrix are row-major and column-major order. Let’s consider an mn matrix4a matrix with m rows and n columns. In row-major order, the matrix is stored row by row, and in column- major order, the matrix is stored column by column. For example, consider the 2  3 matrix M D Ï 1 2 3 4 5 6 Ð : (10.1) Row-major order stores the two rows 1 2 3 and 4 5 6, whereas column-major order stores the three columns 1 4; 2 5; and 3 6. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 10.1 show how to store this matrix using a single one-dimensional array. It’s stored in row-major order in part (a) and in column- major order in part (b). If the rows, columns, and the single array all are indexed starting at s , then M Œi; j �4the element in row i and column j 4is at array in- dex s C .n.i  s// C .j  s/ with row-major order and s C .m.j  s// C .i  s/ with column-major order. When s D 1, the single-array indices are n.i  1/ C j with row-major order and i C m.j  1/ with column-major order. When s D 0, the single-array indices are simpler: ni C j with row-major order and i C mj with column-major order. For the example matrix M with 1-origin indexing, ele- ment M Œ2; 1� is stored at index 3.2 1/ C1 D 4 in the single array using row-major order and at index 2 C 2.1  1/ D 2 using column-major order. Parts (c) and (d) of Figure 10.1 show multiple-array strategies for storing the example matrix. In part (c), each row is stored in its own array of length n, shown in tan. Another array, with m elements, shown in blue, points to the m row arrays. If we call the blue array A, then AŒi � points to the array storing the entries for row i of M , and array element AŒi �Œj � stores matrix element M Œi; j �. Part (d) shows the column-major version of the multiple-array representation, with n arrays, each of 254 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures length m, representing the n columns. Matrix element M Œi; j � is stored in array element AŒj �Œi �. Single-array representations are typically more efûcient on modern machines than multiple-array representations. But multiple-array representations can some- times be more üexible, for example, allowing for <ragged arrays,= in which the rows in the row-major version may have different lengths, or symmetrically for the column-major version, where columns may have different lengths. Occasionally, other schemes are used to store matrices. In the block representa- tion, the matrix is divided into blocks, and each block is stored contiguously. For example, a 4  4 matrix that is divided into 2  2 blocks, such as  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ˘ might be stored in a single array in the order h1; 2; 5; 6; 3; 4; 7; 8; 9; 10; 13; 14; 11; 12; 15; 16i. 10.1.3 Stacks and queues Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE operation is prespeciûed. In a stack, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, ûrst-out, or LIFO, policy. Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a ûrst-in, ûrst-out, or FIFO, policy. There are several efûcient ways to implement stacks and queues on a computer. Here, you will see how to use an array with attributes to store them. Stacks The I NSERT operation on a stack is often called PUSH, and the DELETE opera- tion, which does not take an element argument, is often called P OP. These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack, since only the top plate is accessible. Figure 10.2 shows how to implement a stack of at most n elements with an array SŒ1 W n�. The stack has attributes S: top, indexing the most recently inserted element, and S: size, equaling the size n of the array. The stack consists of elements SŒ1 W S: top�, where SŒ1� is the element at the bottom of the stack and SŒS: top� is the element at the top. 10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues 255 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 S 15 6 2 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 S 15 6 2 9 17 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 S 15 6 2 9 17 3 (a) (b) (c) S: top D 4 S: top D 6 S: top D 5 Figure 10.2 An array implementation of a stack S . Stack elements appear only in the tan positions. (a) Stack S has 4 elements. The top element is 9. (b) Stack S after the calls PUSH.S; 17/ and PUSH.S; 3/. (c) Stack S after the call POP.S/ has returned the element 3, which is the one most recently pushed. Although element 3 still appears in the array, it is no longer in the stack. The top is element 17. When S: top D 0, the stack contains no elements and is empty. We can test whether the stack is empty with the query operation STAC K-EMPTY. Upon an attempt to pop an empty stack, the stack underüows, which is normally an error. If S: top exceeds S: size, the stack overüows. The procedures STAC K-EMPTY, PUSH, and POP implement each of the stack operations with just a few lines of code. Figure 10.2 shows the effects of the modifying operations PUSH and POP. Each of the three stack operations takes O.1/ time. STAC K-EMPTY .S/ 1 if S: top == 0 2 return TRUE 3 else return FALSE PUSH.S; x/ 1 if S: top == S: size 2 error <overüow= 3 else S: top D S: top C 1 4 SŒS: top� D x POP.S/ 1 if STAC K-EMPTY .S/ 2 error <underüow= 3 else S: top D S: top  1 4 return SŒS: top C 1� 256 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Q (a) 15 6 9 8 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Q (b) 15 6 9 8 4 3 5 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Q (c) 15 6 9 8 4 3 5 17 Q: head D 7 Q: head D 7 Q: tail D 12 Q: tail D 3 Q: tail D 3 Q: head D 8 Figure 10.3 A queue implemented using an array QŒ1 W 12�. Queue elements appear only in the tan positions. (a) The queue has 5 elements, in locations QŒ7 W 11�. (b) The conûguration of the queue after the calls ENQUEUE.Q; 17/, ENQUEUE.Q; 3/, and ENQUEUE.Q; 5/. (c) The conûguration of the queue after the call DEQUEUE.Q/ returns the key value 15 formerly at the head of the queue. The new head has key 6. Queues We call the I NSERT operation on a queue ENQUEUE, and we call the DELETE operation DEQUEUE. Like the stack operation POP, DEQUEUE takes no element argument. The FIFO property of a queue causes it to operate like a line of cus- tomers waiting for service. The queue has a head and a tail. When an element is enqueued, it takes its place at the tail of the queue, just as a newly arriving cus- tomer takes a place at the end of the line. The element dequeued is always the one at the head of the queue, like the customer at the head of the line, who has waited the longest. Figure 10.3 shows one way to implement a queue of at most n  1 elements using an array QŒ1 W n�, with the attribute Q: size equaling the size n of the array. The queue has an attribute Q: head that indexes, or points to, its head. The attribute Q: tail indexes the next location at which a newly arriving element will be inserted into the queue.

In the procedures ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE, we have omitted the error checking for underüow and overüow. (Exercise 10.1-5 asks you to supply these checks.)

Unlike an array, however, in which the linear order is determined by the array indices, the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object. Since the elements of linked lists often contain keys that can be searched for, linked lists are sometimes called search lists. Linked lists provide a simple, üexible representation for dynamic sets, supporting (though not necessarily efûciently) all the operations listed on page 250. As shown in Figure 10.4, each element of a doubly linked list L is an object with an attribute key and two pointer attributes: next and prev. The object may 10.2 Linked lists 259 9 16 4 1 prev key next (a) 9 16 4 1 (b) 25 9 4 1 (c) 25 9 (d) 25 36 16 36 16 1 L: head L: head L: head L: head Figure 10.4 (a) A doubly linked list L representing the dynamic set f1; 4; 9; 16g. Each element in the list is an object with attributes for the key and pointers (shown by arrows) to the next and previous objects. The next attribute of the tail and the prev attribute of the head are NIL, indicated by a diagonal slash. The attribute L: head points to the head. (b) Following the execution of L IST-PREPEND.L; x/, where x: key D 25, the linked list has an object with key 25 as the new head. This new object points to the old head with key 9. (c) The result of calling L IST-I NSERT.x; y/, where x: key D 36 and y points to the object with key 9. (d) The result of the subsequent call L IST-DELETE.L; x/, where x points to the object with key 4. also contain other satellite data. Given an element x in the list, x: next points to its successor in the linked list, and x: prev points to its predecessor. If x: prev D NIL, the element x has no predecessor and is therefore the ûrst element, or head, of the list. If x: next D NIL, the element x has no successor and is therefore the last element, or tail, of the list. An attribute L: head points to the ûrst element of the list. If L: head D NIL, the list is empty. A list may have one of several forms. It may be either singly linked or doubly linked, it may be sorted or not, and it may be circular or not. If a list is singly linked, each element has a next pointer but not a prev pointer. If a list is sorted, the linear order of the list corresponds to the linear order of keys stored in elements of the list. The minimum element is then the head of the list, and the maximum element is the tail. If the list is unsorted, the elements can appear in any order. In a circular list, the prev pointer of the head of the list points to the tail, and the next pointer of the tail of the list points to the head. You can think of a circular list as a ring of elements. In the remainder of this section, we assume that the lists we are working with are unsorted and doubly linked. 260 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures Searching a linked list The procedure LIST-SEARCH .L; k/ ûnds the ûrst element with key k in list L by a simple linear search, returning a pointer to this element. If no object with key k appears in the list, then the procedure returns NIL. For the linked list in Figure 10.4(a), the call LIST-SEARCH .L; 4/ returns a pointer to the third element, and the call LIST-SEARCH .L; 7/ returns NIL. To search a list of n objects, the LIST-SEARCH procedure takes ‚.n/ time in the worst case, since it may have to search the entire list. LIST-SEARCH .L; k/ 1 x D L: head 2 while x ¤ NIL and x: key ¤ k 3 x D x: next 4 return x Inserting into a linked list Given an element x whose key attribute has already been set, the LIST-PREPEND procedure adds x to the front of the linked list, as shown in Figure 10.4(b). (Re- call that our attribute notation can cascade, so that L: head: prev denotes the prev attribute of the object that L: head points to.) The running time for LIST-PREPEND on a list of n elements is O.1/. LIST-PREPEND .L; x/ 1 x: next D L: head 2 x: prev D NIL 3 if L: head ¤ NIL 4 L: head: prev D x 5 L: head D x You can insert anywhere within a linked list. As Figure 10.4(c) shows, if you have a pointer y to an object in the list, the LIST-I NSERT procedure on the facing page <splices= a new element x into the list, immediately following y , in O.1/ time. Since LIST-I NSERT never references the list object L, it is not supplied as a parameter. 10.2 Linked lists 261 LIST-I NSERT .x; y/ 1 x: next D y: next 2 x: prev D y 3 if y: next ¤ NIL 4 y: next: prev D x 5 y: next D x Deleting from a linked list The procedure LIST-DELETE removes an element x from a linked list L. It must be given a pointer to x , and it then <‘splices= x out of the list by updating pointers. To delete an element with a given key, ûrst call L IST-SEARCH to retrieve a pointer to the element. Figure 10.4(d) shows how an element is deleted from a linked list. LIST-DELETE runs in O.1/ time, but to delete an element with a given key, the call to LIST-SEARCH makes the worst-case running time be ‚.n/. LIST-DELETE .L; x/ 1 if x: prev ¤ NIL 2 x: prev: next D x: next 3 else L: head D x: next 4 if x: next ¤ NIL 5 x: next: prev D x: prev Insertion and deletion are faster operations on doubly linked lists than on arrays. If you want to insert a new ûrst element into an array or delete the ûrst element in an array, maintaining the relative order of all the existing elements, then each of the existing elements needs to be moved by one position. In the worst case, therefore, insertion and deletion take ‚.n/ time in an array, compared with O.1/ time for a doubly linked list. (Exercise 10.2-1 asks you to show that deleting an element from a singly linked list takes ‚.n/ time in the worst case.) If, however, you want to ûnd the kth element in the linear order, it takes just O.1/ time in an array regardless of k, but in a linked list, you’d have to traverse k elements, taking ‚.k/ time. Sentinels The code for LIST-DELETE is simpler if you ignore the boundary conditions at the head and tail of the list: 262 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures 9 16 4 1 9 16 4 1 25 9 16 4 25 (a) (c) 9 16 4 25 (e) 36 L: nil L: nil L: nil L: nil L: nil Figure 10.5 A circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel.

(b) The linked list from Figure 10.4(a), with key 9 at the head and key 1 at the tail. (c) The list after executing LIST-I NSERT 0 .x; L: nil/, where x: key D 25. The new object becomes the head of the list. (d) The list after deleting the object with key 1. The new tail is the object with key 4. (e) The list after executing LIST-I NSERT 0 .x; y/, where x: key D 36 and y points to the object with key 9. LIST-DELETE 0 .x/ 1 x: prev: next D x: next 2 x: next : prev D x: prev A sentinel is a dummy object that allows us to simplify boundary conditions. In a linked list L, the sentinel is an object L: nil that represents NIL but has all the attributes of the other objects in the list. References to NIL are replaced by references to the sentinel L: nil. As shown in Figure 10.5, this change turns a regular doubly linked list into a circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel, in which the sentinel L: nil lies between the head and tail. The attribute L: nil: next points to the head of the list, and L: nil: prev points to the tail. Similarly, both the next attribute of the tail and the prev attribute of the head point to L: nil. Since L: nil: next points to the head, the attribute L: head is eliminated altogether, with references to it replaced by references to L: nil: next . Figure 10.5(a) shows that an empty list consists of just the sentinel, and both L: nil: next and L: nil: prev point to L: nil. To delete an element from the list, just use the two-line procedure LIST-DELETE 0 from before. Just as LIST-I NSERT never references the list object L, neither does 10.2 Linked lists 263 LIST-DELETE 0 . You should never delete the sentinel L: nil unless you are deleting the entire list! The LIST-I NSERT 0 procedure inserts an element x into the list following ob- ject y . No separate procedure for prepending is necessary: to insert at the head of the list, let y be L: nil; and to insert at the tail, let y be L: nil: prev. Figure 10.5 shows the effects of LIST-I NSERT 0 and LIST-DELETE 0 on a sample list. LIST-I NSERT 0 .x; y/ 1 x: next D y: next 2 x: prev D y 3 y: next: prev D x 4 y: next D x Searching a circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel has the same asymptotic running time as without a sentinel, but it is possible to decrease the constant factor. The test in line 2 of LIST-SEARCH makes two comparisons: one to check whether the search has run off the end of the list and, if not, one to check whether the key resides in the current element x . Suppose that you know that the key is somewhere in the list. Then you do not need to check whether the search runs off the end of the list, thereby eliminating one comparison in each iteration of the while loop. The sentinel provides a place to put the key before starting the search. The search starts at the head L: nil: next of list L, and it stops if it ûnds the key somewhere in the list. Now the search is guaranteed to ûnd the key, either in the sentinel or before reaching the sentinel. If the key is found before reaching the sentinel, then it really is in the element where the search stops. If, however, the search goes through all the elements in the list and ûnds the key only in the sentinel, then the key is not really in the list, and the search returns NIL. The procedure LIST-SEARCH 0 embodies this idea. (If your sentinel requires its key attribute to be NIL, then you might want to assign L: nil: key D NIL before line 5.) LIST-SEARCH 0 .L; k/ 1 L: nil: key D k // store the key in the sentinel to guarantee it is in list 2 x D L: nil: next // start at the head of the list 3 while x: key ¤ k 4 x D x: next 5 if x == L: nil // found k in the sentinel 6 return NIL // k was not really in the list 7 else return x // found k in element x 264 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures Sentinels often simplify code and, as in searching a linked list, they might speed up code by a small constant factor, but they don’t typically improve the asymptotic running time. Use them judiciously. When there are many small lists, the extra storage used by their sentinels can represent signiûcant wasted memory. In this book, we use sentinels only when they signiûcantly simplify the code. Exercises 10.2-1 Explain why the dynamic-set operation I NSERT on a singly linked list can be im- plemented in O.1/ time, but the worst-case time for DELETE is ‚.n/. 10.2-2 Implement a stack using a singly linked list.

The operations ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE should still take O.1/ time. Do you need to add any attributes to the list? 10.2-4 The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S 1 and S 2 as input, and it returns a set S D S 1 [ S 2 consisting of all the elements of S 1 and S 2 . The sets S 1 and S 2 are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support U NION in O.1/ time using a suitable list data structure. 10.2-5 Give a ‚.n/-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked list of n elements. The procedure should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself. ? 10.2-6 Explain how to implement doubly linked lists using only one pointer value x: np per item instead of the usual two (next and prev). Assume that all pointer values can be interpreted as k-bit integers, and deûne x: np D x: next XOR x: prev, the k-bit <exclusive-or= of x: next and x: prev. The value NIL is represented by 0. Be sure to describe what information you need to access the head of the list. Show how to implement the SEARCH, I NSERT, and DELETE operations on such a list. Also show how to reverse such a list in O.1/ time. 10.3 Representing rooted trees 265 10.3 Representing rooted trees Linked lists work well for representing linear relationships, but not all relationships are linear. In this section, we look speciûcally at the problem of representing rooted trees by linked data structures. We ûrst look at binary trees, and then we present a method for rooted trees in which nodes can have an arbitrary number of children. We represent each node of a tree by an object. As with linked lists, we assume that each node contains a key attribute. The remaining attributes of interest are pointers to other nodes, and they vary according to the type of tree. Binary trees Figure 10.6 shows how to use the attributes p, left , and right to store pointers to the parent, left child, and right child of each node in a binary tree T . If x: p D NIL, then x is the root. If node x has no left child, then x: left D NIL, and similarly for the right child. The root of the entire tree T is pointed to by the attribute T: root . If T: root D NIL, then the tree is empty. Rooted trees with unbounded branching It’s simple to extend the scheme for representing a binary tree to any class of trees in which the number of children of each node is at most some constant k: replace the left and right attributes by child 1 ; child 2 ; : : : ; child k . This scheme no longer works when the number of children of a node is unbounded, however, since we do not know how many attributes to allocate in advance. Moreover, if k, the number of children, is bounded by a large constant but most nodes have a small number of children, we may waste a lot of memory. Fortunately, there is a clever scheme to represent trees with arbitrary numbers of children. It has the advantage of using only O.n/ space for any n-node rooted tree. The left-child, right-sibling representation appears in Figure 10.7. As before, each node contains a parent pointer p, and T: root points to the root of tree T . Instead of having a pointer to each of its children, however, each node x has only two pointers: 1. x: left-child points to the leftmost child of node x , and 2. x: right-sibling points to the sibling of x immediately to its right. If node x has no children, then x: left-child D NIL, and if node x is the rightmost child of its parent, then x: right-sibling D NIL. 266 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures T: root Figure 10.6 The representation of a binary tree T . Each node x has the attributes x: p (top), x: left (lower left), and x: right (lower right). The key attributes are not shown. T: root Figure 10.7 The left-child, right-sibling representation of a tree T . Each node x has attributes x: p (top), x: left-child (lower left), and x: right-sibling (lower right). The key attributes are not shown. 10.3 Representing rooted trees 267 Other tree representations We sometimes represent rooted trees in other ways. In Chapter 6, for example, we represented a heap, which is based on a complete binary tree, by a single array along with an attribute giving the index of the last node in the heap. The trees that appear in Chapter 19 are traversed only toward the root, and so only the parent pointers are present: there are no pointers to children. Many other schemes are possible. Which scheme is best depends on the application. Exercises 10.3-1 Draw the binary tree rooted at index 6 that is represented by the following at- tributes: index key left right 1 17 8 9 2 14 NIL NIL 3 12 NIL NIL 4 20 10 NIL 5 33 2 NIL 6 15 1 4 7 28 NIL NIL 8 22 NIL NIL 9 13 3 7 10 25 NIL 5 10.3-2 Write an O.n/-time recursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree. 10.3-3 Write an O.n/-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node in the tree. Use a stack as an auxiliary data structure. 10.3-4 Write an O.n/-time procedure that prints out all the keys of an arbitrary rooted tree with n nodes, where the tree is stored using the left-child, right-sibling representa- tion. ? 10.3-5 Write an O.n/-time nonrecursive procedure that, given an n-node binary tree, prints out the key of each node. Use no more than constant extra space outside 268 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures of the tree itself and do not modify the tree, even temporarily, during the proce- dure. ? 10.3-6 The left-child, right-sibling representation of an arbitrary rooted tree uses three pointers in each node: left-child , right-sibling, and parent . From any node, its parent can be accessed in constant time and all its children can be accessed in time linear in the number of children. Show how to use only two pointers and one boolean value in each node x so that x ’s parent or all of x ’s children can be accessed in time linear in the number of x ’s children. Problems 10-1 Comparisons among lists For each of the four types of lists in the following table, what is the asymptotic worst-case running time for each dynamic-set operation listed? unsorted, sorted, unsorted, sorted, singly singly doubly doubly linked linked linked linked SEARCH I NSERT DELETE SUCCESSOR PREDECESSOR MINIMUM MAXIMUM 10-2 Mergeable heaps using linked lists A mergeable heap supports the following operations: MAKE-HEAP (which creates an empty mergeable heap), I NSERT, MINIMUM, EXTRACT-MIN, and UNION. 1 1 Because we have deûned a mergeable heap to support M INIMUM and EXTRACT-MIN, we can also refer to it as a mergeable min-heap. Alternatively, if it supports M AXIMUM and EXTRACT-MAX, it is a mergeable max-heap. Problems for Chapter 10 269 Show how to implement mergeable heaps using linked lists in each of the following cases. Try to make each operation as efûcient as possible. Analyze the running time of each operation in terms of the size of the dynamic set(s) being operated on. a. Lists are sorted. b. Lists are unsorted. c. Lists are unsorted, and dynamic sets to be merged are disjoint. 10-3 Searching a sorted compact list We can represent a singly linked list with two arrays, key and next . Given the index i of an element, its value is stored in keyŒi �, and the index of its successor is given by next Œi �, where next Œi � D NIL for the last element. We also need the index head of the ûrst element in the list. An n-element list stored in this way is compact if it is stored only in positions 1 through n of the key and next arrays. Let’s assume that all keys are distinct and that the compact list is also sorted, that is, keyŒi � < keyŒnext Œi �� for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; n such that next Œi � ¤ NIL. Under these assumptions, you will show that the randomized algorithm C OMPAC T -LIST- SEARCH searches the list for key k in O. p n/ expected time. COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH .key; next ; head ; n; k/ 1 i D head 2 while i ¤ NIL and keyŒi � < k 3 j D RANDOM.1; n/ 4 if keyŒi � < keyŒj � and keyŒj � හ k 5 i D j 6 if keyŒi � == k 7 return i 8 i D next Œi � 9 if i == NIL or keyŒi � > k 10 return NIL 11 else return i If you ignore lines 337 of the procedure, you can see that it’s an ordinary algo- rithm for searching a sorted linked list, in which index i points to each position of the list in turn. The search terminates once the index i <falls off= the end of the list or once keyŒi �  k. In the latter case, if keyŒi � D k, the procedure has found a key with the value k. If, however, keyŒi � > k, then the search will never ûnd a key with the value k, so that terminating the search was the correct action. 270 Chapter 10 Elementary Data Structures Lines 337 attempt to skip ahead to a randomly chosen position j . Such a skip helps if keyŒj � is larger than keyŒi � and no larger than k. In such a case, j marks a position in the list that i would reach during an ordinary list search. Because the list is compact, we know that any choice of j between 1 and n indexes some element in the list. Instead of analyzing the performance of C OMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH directly, you will analyze a related algorithm, COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 , which executes two separate loops. This algorithm takes an additional parameter t , which speciûes an upper bound on the number of iterations of the ûrst loop. COMPAC T -LIST-S EARCH 0 .key; next ; head ; n; k; t/ 1 i D head 2 for q D 1 to t 3 j D RANDOM.1; n/ 4 if keyŒi � < keyŒj � and keyŒj � හ k 5 i D j 6 if keyŒi � == k 7 return i 8 while i ¤ NIL and keyŒi � < k 9 i D next Œi � 10 if i == NIL or keyŒi � > k 11 return NIL 12 else return i To compare the execution of the two algorithms, assume that the sequence of calls of RANDOM.1; n/ yields the same sequence of integers for both algorithms. a. Argue that for any value of t , COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH .key; next ; head; n; k/ and COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 .key; next ; head; n; k; t/ return the same result and that the number of iterations of the while loop of lines 238 in COMPAC T - LIST-SEARCH is at most the total number of iterations of both the for and while loops in COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 . In the call COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 .key; next ; head; n; k; t/, let X t be the random variable that describes the distance in the linked list (that is, through the chain of next pointers) from position i to the desired key k after t iterations of the for loop of lines 237 have occurred. b. Argue that COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 .key; next ; head ; n; k; t/ has an expected running time of O.t C E ŒX t �/. c. Show that E ŒX t � D P n r D1 .1r=n/ t . (Hint: Use equation (C.28) on page 1193.)

Show that COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH 0 .key; next ; head ; n; k; t/ has an expected running time of O.t C n=t/. g. Conclude that COMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH runs in O. p n/ expected time. h. Why do we assume that all keys are distinct in C OMPAC T -LIST-SEARCH? Ar- gue that random skips do not necessarily help asymptotically when the list con- tains repeated key values. Chapter notes Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [6] and Knuth [259] are excellent references for ele- mentary data structures. Many other texts cover both basic data structures and their implementation in a particular programming language. Examples of these types of textbooks include Goodrich and Tamassia [196], Main [311], Shaffer [406], and Weiss [452, 453, 454]. The book by Gonnet and Baeza-Yates [193] provides ex- perimental data on the performance of many data-structure operations. The origin of stacks and queues as data structures in computer science is un- clear, since corresponding notions already existed in mathematics and paper-based business practices before the introduction of digital computers. Knuth [259] cites A. M. Turing for the development of stacks for subroutine linkage in 1947. Pointer-based data structures also seem to be a folk invention. According to Knuth, pointers were apparently used in early computers with drum memories. The A-1 language developed by G. M. Hopper in 1951 represented algebraic formulas as binary trees. Knuth credits the IPL-II language, developed in 1956 by A. Newell, J. C. Shaw, and H. A. Simon, for recognizing the importance and promoting the use of pointers. Their IPL-III language, developed in 1957, included explicit stack operations. 11 Hash Tables Many applications require a dynamic set that supports only the dictionary opera- tions I NSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE. For example, a compiler that translates a programming language maintains a symbol table, in which the keys of elements are arbitrary character strings corresponding to identiûers in the language. A hash table is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. Although search- ing for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a linked list4‚.n/ time in the worst case4in practice, hashing performs extremely well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time to search for an element in a hash table is O.1/. Indeed, the built-in dictionaries of Python are implemented with hash tables. A hash table generalizes the simpler notion of an ordinary array. Directly ad- dressing into an ordinary array takes advantage of the O.1/ access time for any array element. Section 11.1 discusses direct addressing in more detail. To use di- rect addressing, you must be able to allocate an array that contains a position for every possible key. When the number of keys actually stored is small relative to the total number of possible keys, hash tables become an effective alternative to directly address- ing an array, since a hash table typically uses an array of size proportional to the number of keys actually stored. Instead of using the key as an array index directly, we compute the array index from the key. Section 11.2 presents the main ideas, focusing on <chaining= as a way to handle <collisions,= in which more than one key maps to the same array index. Section 11.3 describes how to compute array indices from keys using hash functions. We present and analyze several variations on the basic theme. Section 11.4 looks at <open addressing,= which is another way to deal with collisions. The bottom line is that hashing is an extremely effective and practical technique: the basic dictionary operations require only O.1/ time on the average. Section 11.5 discusses the hierarchical memory systems of modern computer systems have and illustrates how to design hash tables that work well in such systems. 11.1 Direct-address tables 273 11.1 Direct-address tables Direct addressing is a simple technique that works well when the universe U of keys is reasonably small. Suppose that an application needs a dynamic set in which each element has a distinct key drawn from the universe U D f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g, where m is not too large. To represent the dynamic set, you can use an array, or direct-address table, de- noted by T Œ0 W m  1�, in which each position, or slot, corresponds to a key in the universe U . Figure 11.1 illustrates this approach. Slot k points to an element in the set with key k. If the set contains no element with key k, then T Œk� D NIL. The dictionary operations DIRECT-ADDRESS-SEARCH, DIRECT-ADDRESS- I NSERT, and DIRECT-ADDRESS-DELETE on the following page are trivial to im- plement. Each takes only O.1/ time. For some applications, the direct-address table itself can hold the elements in the dynamic set. That is, rather than storing an element’s key and satellite data in an object external to the direct-address table, with a pointer from a slot in the table to the object, save space by storing the object directly in the slot. To indicate an empty slot, use a special key. Then again, why store the key of the object at all? The index of the object is its key! Of course, then you’d need some way to tell whether slots are empty.

Describe a procedure that ûnds the maximum element of S . What is the worst-case perfor- mance of your procedure? 11.1-2 A bit vector is simply an array of bits (each either 0 or 1). A bit vector of length m takes much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements drawn from the set f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g and with no satellite data. Dictionary operations should run in O.1/ time. 11.1-3 Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored el- ements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data. All three dictionary operations (I NSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in O.1/ time. (Don’t forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an object to be deleted, not a key.) ? 11.1-4 Suppose that you want to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a huge array. That is, if the array size is m and the dictionary contains at most n elements at any one time, then m  n. At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use O.1/ space; the operations SEARCH, I NSERT, and DELETE should take O.1/ time each; and initializing the data structure should take O.1/ time. (Hint: Use an additional array, treated somewhat like a stack whose size is the number of keys actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or not.) 11.2 Hash tables 275 11.2 Hash tables The downside of direct addressing is apparent: if the universe U is large or inûnite, storing a table T of size jU j may be impractical, or even impossible, given the memory available on a typical computer. Furthermore, the set K of keys actually stored may be so small relative to U that most of the space allocated for T would be wasted. When the set K of keys stored in a dictionary is much smaller than the uni- verse U of all possible keys, a hash table requires much less storage than a direct- address table. Speciûcally, the storage requirement reduces to ‚.jKj/ while main- taining the beneût that searching for an element in the hash table still requires only O.1/ time. The catch is that this bound is for the average-case time, 1 whereas for direct addressing it holds for the worst-case time. With direct addressing, an element with key k is stored in slot k, but with hash- ing, we use a hash function h to compute the slot number from the key k, so that the element goes into slot h.k/. The hash function h maps the universe U of keys into the slots of a hash table T Œ0 W m  1�: h W U ! f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g ; where the size m of the hash table is typically much less than jU j. We say that an element with key k hashes to slot h.k/, and we also say that h.k/ is the hash value of key k. Figure 11.2 illustrates the basic idea. The hash function reduces the range of array indices and hence the size of the array. Instead of a size of jU j, the array can have size m. An example of a simple, but not particularly good, hash function is h.k/ D k mod m. There is one hitch, namely that two keys may hash to the same slot. We call this situation a collision. Fortunately, there are effective techniques for resolving the conüict created by collisions. Of course, the ideal solution is to avoid collisions altogether. We might try to achieve this goal by choosing a suitable hash function h. One idea is to make h ap- pear to be <random,= thus avoiding collisions or at least minimizing their number. The very term <to hash,= evoking images of random mixing and chopping, cap- tures the spirit of this approach. (Of course, a hash function h must be determin- istic in that a given input k must always produce the same output h.k/.) Because jU j > m, however, there must be at least two keys that have the same hash value, 1 The deûnition of <average-case= requires care4are we assuming an input distribution over the keys, or are we randomizing the choice of hash function itself? We’ll consider both approaches, but with an emphasis on the use of a randomly chosen hash function. 276 Chapter 11 Hash Tables T U (universe of keys) K (actual keys) 0 31 k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 k 5 h(k 1 ) h(k 4 ) h(k 3 ) h(k 2 ) = h(k 5 ) Figure 11.2 Using a hash function h to map keys to hash-table slots. Because keys k 2 and k 5 map to the same slot, they collide. and avoiding collisions altogether is impossible. Thus, although a well-designed, <random=-looking hash function can reduce the number of collisions, we still need a method for resolving the collisions that do occur. The remainder of this section ûrst presents a deûnition of <independent uniform hashing,= which captures the simplest notion of what it means for a hash function to be <random.= It then presents and analyzes the simplest collision resolution tech- nique, called chaining. Section 11.4 introduces an alternative method for resolving collisions, called open addressing. Independent uniform hashing An <ideal= hashing function h would have, for each possible input k in the do- main U , an output h.k/ that is an element randomly and independently chosen uniformly from the range f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g. Once a value h.k/ is randomly cho- sen, each subsequent call to h with the same input k yields the same output h.k/. We call such an ideal hash function an independent uniform hash function. Such a function is also often called a random oracle [43]. When hash tables are implemented with an independent uniform hash function, we say we are using independent uniform hashing. Independent uniform hashing is an ideal theoretical abstraction, but it is not something that can reasonably be implemented in practice. Nonetheless, we’ll analyze the efûciency of hashing under the assumption of independent uniform hashing and then present ways of achieving useful practical approximations to this ideal. 11.2 Hash tables 277 T U (universe of keys) K (actual keys) k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 k 5 k 6 k 7 k 8 k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 k 5 k 6 k 7 k 8 Figure 11.3 Collision resolution by chaining. Each nonempty hash-table slot T Œj � points to a linked list of all the keys whose hash value is j . For example, h.k 1 / D h.k 4 / and h.k 5 / D h.k 2 / D h.k 7 /. The list can be either singly or doubly linked. We show it as doubly linked because deletion may be faster that way when the deletion procedure knows which list element (not just which key) is to be deleted. Collision resolution by chaining At a high level, you can think of hashing with chaining as a nonrecursive form of divide-and-conquer: the input set of n elements is divided randomly into m subsets, each of approximate size n=m. A hash function determines which subset an element belongs to. Each subset is managed independently as a list. Figure 11.3 shows the idea behind chaining: each nonempty slot points to a linked list, and all the elements that hash to the same slot go into that slot’s linked list. Slot j contains a pointer to the head of the list of all stored elements with hash value j . If there are no such elements, then slot j contains NIL. When collisions are resolved by chaining, the dictionary operations are straight- forward to implement. They appear on the next page and use the linked-list pro- cedures from Section 10.2. The worst-case running time for insertion is O.1/. The insertion procedure is fast in part because it assumes that the element x be- ing inserted is not already present in the table. To enforce this assumption, you can search (at additional cost) for an element whose key is x: key before inserting. For searching, the worst-case running time is proportional to the length of the list. (We’ll analyze this operation more closely below.) Deletion takes O.1/ time if the lists are doubly linked, as in Figure 11.3. (Since CHAINED-HASH-DELETE takes as input an element x and not its key k, no search is needed. If the hash table supports deletion, then its linked lists should be doubly linked in order to delete an item quickly. If the lists were only singly linked, then by Exercise 10.2-1, deletion 278 Chapter 11 Hash Tables CHAINED-HASH-I NSERT .T; x/ 1 LIST-PREPEND .T Œh.x: key/�; x/ CHAINED-HASH-SEARCH .T; k/ 1 return LIST-SEARCH .T Œh.k/�; k/ CHAINED-HASH-DELETE .T; x/ 1 LIST-DELETE .T Œh.x: key/�; x/ could take time proportional to the length of the list. With singly linked lists, both deletion and searching would have the same asymptotic running times.) Analysis of hashing with chaining How well does hashing with chaining perform? In particular, how long does it take to search for an element with a given key? Given a hash table T with m slots that stores n elements, we deûne the load factor ˛ for T as n=m, that is, the average number of elements stored in a chain. Our analysis will be in terms of ˛, which can be less than, equal to, or greater than 1. The worst-case behavior of hashing with chaining is terrible: all n keys hash to the same slot, creating a list of length n. The worst-case time for searching is thus ‚.n/ plus the time to compute the hash function4no better than using one linked list for all the elements. We clearly don’t use hash tables for their worst-case performance. The average-case performance of hashing depends on how well the hash func- tion h distributes the set of keys to be stored among the m slots, on the average (meaning with respect to the distribution of keys to be hashed and with respect to the choice of hash function, if this choice is randomized). Section 11.3 discusses these issues, but for now we assume that any given element is equally likely to hash into any of the m slots. That is, the hash function is uniform. We further assume that where a given element hashes to is independent of where any other el- ements hash to. In other words, we assume that we are using independent uniform hashing. Because hashes of distinct keys are assumed to be independent, independent uni- form hashing is universal: the chance that any two distinct keys k 1 and k 2 collide is at most 1=m. Universality is important in our analysis and also in the speciûcation of universal families of hash functions, which we’ll see in Section 11.3.2. For j D 0; 1; : : : ; m  1, denote the length of the list T Œj � by n j , so that 11.2 Hash tables 279 D n 0 C n 1 C    C n m1 ; (11.1) and the expected value of n j is E Œn j � D ˛ D n=m. We assume that O.1/ time sufûces to compute the hash value h.k/, so that the time required to search for an element with key k depends linearly on the length n h.k/ of the list T Œh.k/�. Setting aside the O.1/ time required to compute the hash function and to access slot h.k/, we’ll consider the expected number of elements examined by the search algorithm, that is, the number of elements in the list T Œh.k/� that the algorithm checks to see whether any have a key equal to k. We consider two cases. In the ûrst, the search is unsuccessful: no element in the table has key k. In the second, the search successfully ûnds an element with key k. Theorem 11.1 In a hash table in which collisions are resolved by chaining, an unsuccessful search takes ‚.1 C ˛/ time on average, under the assumption of independent uniform hashing. Proof Under the assumption of independent uniform hashing, any key k not al- ready stored in the table is equally likely to hash to any of the m slots. The expected time to search unsuccessfully for a key k is the expected time to search to the end of list T Œh.k/�, which has expected length E Œn h.k/ � D ˛. Thus, the expected number of elements examined in an unsuccessful search is ˛, and the total time required (including the time for computing h.k/) is ‚.1 C ˛/. The situation for a successful search is slightly different. An unsuccessful search is equally likely to go to any slot of the hash table. A successful search, however, cannot go to an empty slot, since it is for an element that is present in one of the linked lists. We assume that the element searched for is equally likely to be any one of the elements in the table, so the longer the list, the more likely that the search is for one of its elements. Even so, the expected search time still turns out to be ‚.1 C ˛/. Theorem 11.2 In a hash table in which collisions are resolved by chaining, a successful search takes ‚.1 C ˛/ time on average, under the assumption of independent uniform hashing. Proof We assume that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any of the n elements stored in the table. The number of elements examined during a successful search for an element x is 1 more than the number of elements that appear before x in x ’s list. Because new elements are placed at the front of the list, 280 Chapter 11 Hash Tables elements before x in the list were all inserted after x was inserted. Let x i denote the i th element inserted into the table, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, and let k i D x i : key. Our analysis uses indicator random variables extensively. For each slot q in the table and for each pair of distinct keys k i and k j , we deûne the indicator random variable ij q D I fthe search is for x i , h.k i / D q, and h.k j / D q g : That is, X ij q D 1 when keys k i and k j collide at slot q and the search is for element x i . Because Pr fthe search is for x i g D 1=n, Pr fh.k i / D qg D 1=m, Pr fh.k j / D qg D 1=m, and these events are all independent, we have that Pr fX ij q D 1g D 1=nm 2 . Lemma 5.1 on page 130 gives E ŒX ij q � D 1=nm 2 . Next, we deûne, for each element x j , the indicator random variable Y j D I fx j appears in a list prior to the element being searched forg D m1 X qD0 j 1 X i D1 X ij q ; since at most one of the X ij q equals 1, namely when the element x i being searched for belongs to the same list as x j (pointed to by slot q), and i < j (so that x i appears after x j in the list). Our ûnal random variable is Z, which counts how many elements appear in the list prior to the element being searched for: D n X j D1 Y j : Because we must count the element being searched for as well as all those pre- ceding it in its list, we wish to compute E ŒZ C 1�. Using linearity of expectation (equation (C.24) on page 1192), we have E ŒZ C 1� D E \" 1 C n X j D1 Y j # D 1 C E \" n X j D1 m1 X qD0 j 1 X i D1 X ij q # D 1 C E \" m1 X qD0 n X j D1 j 1 X i D1 X ij q # D 1 C m1 X qD0 n X j D1 j 1 X i D1 E ŒX ij q � (by linearity of expectation) 11.2 Hash tables 281 D 1 C m1 X qD0 n X j D1 j 1 X i D1 1 nm 2 D 1 C m  n.n  1/ 2  1 nm 2 (by equation (A.2) on page 1141) D 1 C n  1 2m D 1 C n 2m  1 2m D 1 C ˛ 2  ˛ 2n : Thus, the total time required for a successful search (including the time for com- puting the hash function) is ‚.2 C ˛=2  ˛=2n/ D ‚.1 C ˛/. What does this analysis mean? If the number of elements in the table is at most proportional to the number of hash-table slots, we have n D O.m/ and, consequently, ˛ D n=m D O.m/=m D O.1/. Thus, searching takes constant time on average. Since insertion takes O.1/ worst-case time and deletion takes O.1/ worst-case time when the lists are doubly linked (assuming that the list element to be deleted is known, and not just its key), we can support all dictionary operations in O.1/ time on average. The analysis in the preceding two theorems depends only on two essential prop- erties of independent uniform hashing: uniformity (each key is equally likely to hash to any one of the m slots), and independence (so any two distinct keys collide with probability 1=m). Exercises 11.2-1 You use a hash function h to hash n distinct keys into an array T of length m. Assuming independent uniform hashing, what is the expected number of colli- sions? More precisely, what is the expected cardinality of ˚ fk 1 ; k 2 g W k 1 ¤ k 2 and h.k 1 / D h.k 2 /  ? 11.2-2 Consider a hash table with 9 slots and the hash function h.k/ D k mod 9. Demon- strate what happens upon inserting the keys 5; 28; 19; 15; 20; 33; 12; 17; 10 with collisions resolved by chaining. 282 Chapter 11 Hash Tables 11.2-3 Professor Marley hypothesizes that he can obtain substantial performance gains by modifying the chaining scheme to keep each list in sorted order. How does the pro- fessor’s modiûcation affect the running time for successful searches, unsuccessful searches, insertions, and deletions? 11.2-4 Suggest how to allocate and deallocate storage for elements within the hash table itself by creating a <free list=: a linked list of all the unused slots. Assume that one slot can store a üag and either one element plus a pointer or two pointers. All dictionary and free-list operations should run in O.1/ expected time. Does the free list need to be doubly linked, or does a singly linked free list sufûce? 11.2-5 You need to store a set of n keys in a hash table of size m. Show that if the keys are drawn from a universe U with jU j > .n  1/m, then U has a subset of size n consisting of keys that all hash to the same slot, so that the worst-case searching time for hashing with chaining is ‚.n/. 11.2-6 You have stored n keys in a hash table of size m, with collisions resolved by chain- ing, and you know the length of each chain, including the length L of the longest chain. Describe a procedure that selects a key uniformly at random from among the keys in the hash table and returns it in expected time O.L  .1 C 1=˛//. 11.3 Hash functions For hashing to work well, it needs a good hash function. Along with being efû- ciently computable, what properties does a good hash function have? How do you design good hash functions? This section ûrst attempts to answer these questions based on two ad hoc ap- proaches for creating hash functions: hashing by division and hashing by multipli- cation. Although these methods work well for some sets of input keys, they are limited because they try to provide a single ûxed hash function that works well on any data4an approach called static hashing. We then see that provably good average-case performance for any data can be obtained by designing a suitable family of hash functions and choosing a hash func- tion at random from this family at runtime, independent of the data to be hashed. The approach we examine is called random hashing. A particular kind of random 11.3 Hash functions 283 hashing, universal hashing, works well. As we saw with quicksort in Chapter 7, randomization is a powerful algorithmic design tool. What makes a good hash function? A good hash function satisûes (approximately) the assumption of independent uni- form hashing: each key is equally likely to hash to any of the m slots, indepen- dently of where any other keys have hashed to. What does <equally likely= mean here? If the hash function is ûxed, any probabilities would have to be based on the probability distribution of the input keys. Unfortunately, you typically have no way to check this condition, unless you happen to know the probability distribution from which the keys are drawn. More- over, the keys might not be drawn independently. Occasionally you might know the distribution. For example, if you know that the keys are random real numbers k independently and uniformly distributed in the range 0 හ k < 1, then the hash function h.k/ D bkmc satisûes the condition of independent uniform hashing. A good static hashing approach derives the hash value in a way that you expect to be independent of any patterns that might exist in the data. For example, the <division method= (discussed in Section 11.3.1) computes the hash value as the remainder when the key is divided by a speciûed prime number. This method may give good results, if you (somehow) choose a prime number that is unrelated to any patterns in the distribution of keys. Random hashing, described in Section 11.3.2, picks the hash function to be used at random from a suitable family of hashing functions. This approach removes any need to know anything about the probability distribution of the input keys, as the randomization necessary for good average-case behavior then comes from the (known) random process used to pick the hash function from the family of hash functions, rather than from the (unknown) process used to create the input keys. We recommend that you use random hashing. Keys are integers, vectors, or strings In practice, a hash function is designed to handle keys that are one of the following two types: A short nonnegative integer that ûts in a w-bit machine word. Typical values for w would be 32 or 64. 284 Chapter 11 Hash Tables  A short vector of nonnegative integers, each of bounded size. For example, each element might be an 8-bit byte, in which case the vector is often called a (byte) string. The vector might be of variable length. To begin, we assume that keys are short nonnegative integers. Handling vector keys is more complicated and discussed in Sections 11.3.5 and 11.5.2. 11.3.1 Static hashing Static hashing uses a single, ûxed hash function. The only randomization available is through the (usually unknown) distribution of input keys. This section discusses two standard approaches for static hashing: the division method and the multiplica- tion method. Although static hashing is no longer recommended, the multiplication method also provides a good foundation for <nonstatic= hashing4better known as random hashing4where the hash function is chosen at random from a suitable family of hash functions. The division method The division method for creating hash functions maps a key k into one of m slots by taking the remainder of k divided by m. That is, the hash function is h.k/ D k mod m : For example, if the hash table has size m D 12 and the key is k D 100, then h.k/ D 4. Since it requires only a single division operation, hashing by division is quite fast. The division method may work well when m is a prime not too close to an exact power of 2. There is no guarantee that this method provides good average-case performance, however, and it may complicate applications since it constrains the size of the hash tables to be prime. The multiplication method The general multiplication method for creating hash functions operates in two steps. First, multiply the key k by a constant A in the range 0 < A < 1 and extract the fractional part of kA. Then, multiply this value by m and take the üoor of the result. That is, the hash function is h.k/ D bm .kA mod 1/c ; where <kA mod 1= means the fractional part of kA, that is, kAbkAc. The general multiplication method has the advantage that the value of m is not critical and you can choose it independently of how you choose the multiplicative constant A. 11.3 Hash functions 285 × a D A 2 w w bits k r 0 r 1 h a .k/ extract ` bits Figure 11.4 The multiply-shift method to compute a hash function. The w-bit representation of the key k is multiplied by the w-bit value a D A  2 w . The ` highest-order bits of the lower w-bit half of the product form the desired hash value h a .k/. The multiply-shift method In practice, the multiplication method is best in the special case where the num- ber m of hash-table slots is an exact power of 2, so that m D 2 ` for some integer `, where ` හ w and w is the number of bits in a machine word. If you choose a ûxed w-bit positive integer a D A 2 w , where 0 < A < 1 as in the multiplication method so that a is in the range 0 < a < 2 w , you can implement the function on most computers as follows. We assume that a key k ûts into a single w-bit word. Referring to Figure 11.4, ûrst multiply k by the w-bit integer a. The result is a 2w-bit value r 1 2 w C r 0 , where r 1 is the high-order w-bit word of the product and r 0 is the low-order w-bit word of the product. The desired `-bit hash value consists of the ` most signiûcant bits of r 0 . (Since r 1 is ignored, the hash function can be implemented on a computer that produces only a w-bit product given two w-bit inputs, that is, where the multiplication operation computes modulo 2 w .) In other words, you deûne the hash function h D h a , where h a .k/ D .ka mod 2 w / o .w  `/ (11.2) for a ûxed nonzero w-bit value a. Since the product ka of two w-bit words occu- pies 2w bits, taking this product modulo 2 w zeroes out the high-order w bits (r 1 ), leaving only the low-order w bits (r 0 ). The o operator performs a logical right shift by w  ` bits, shifting zeros into the vacated positions on the left, so that the ` most signiûcant bits of r 0 move into the ` rightmost positions. (It’s the same as dividing by 2 w` and taking the üoor of the result.) The resulting value equals the ` most signiûcant bits of r 0 . The hash function h a can be implemented with three machine instructions: multiplication, subtraction, and logical right shift. As an example, suppose that k D 123456, ` D 14, m D 2 14 D 16384, and w D 32. Suppose further that we choose a D 2654435769 (following a suggestion 286 Chapter 11 Hash Tables of Knuth [261]). Then ka D 327706022297664 D .76300  2 32 / C 17612864, and so r 1 D 76300 and r 0 D 17612864. The 14 most signiûcant bits of r 0 yield the value h a .k/ D 67. Even though the multiply-shift method is fast, it doesn’t provide any guarantee of good average-case performance. The universal hashing approach presented in the next section provides such a guarantee. A simple randomized variant of the multiply-shift method works well on the average, when the program begins by picking a as a randomly chosen odd integer. 11.3.2 Random hashing Suppose that a malicious adversary chooses the keys to be hashed by some ûxed hash function. Then the adversary can choose n keys that all hash to the same slot, yielding an average retrieval time of ‚.n/. Any static hash function is vulnerable to such terrible worst-case behavior. The only effective way to improve the situation is to choose the hash function randomly in a way that is independent of the keys that are actually going to be stored. This approach is called random hashing. A special case of this approach, called universal hashing, can yield provably good performance on average when collisions are handled by chaining, no matter which keys the adversary chooses. To use random hashing, at the beginning of program execution you select the hash function at random from a suitable family of functions. As in the case of quicksort, randomization guarantees that no single input always evokes worst-case behavior. Because you randomly select the hash function, the algorithm can be- have differently on each execution, even for the same set of keys to be hashed, guaranteeing good average-case performance. Let H be a ûnite family of hash functions that map a given universe U of keys into the range f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g. Such a family is said to be universal if for each pair of distinct keys k 1 ; k 2 2 U , the number of hash functions h 2 H for which h.k 1 / D h.k 2 / is at most jH j =m. In other words, with a hash function randomly chosen from H , the chance of a collision between distinct keys k 1 and k 2 is no more than the chance 1=m of a collision if h.k 1 / and h.k 2 / were randomly and independently chosen from the set f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g. Independent uniform hashing is the same as picking a hash function uniformly at random from a family of m n hash functions, each member of that family mapping the n keys to the m hash values in a different way. Every independent uniform random family of hash function is universal, but the converse need not be true: consider the case where U D f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g and the only hash function in the family is the identity function. The probability that two distinct keys collide is zero, even though each key is hashes to a ûxed value. 11.3 Hash functions 287 The following corollary to Theorem 11.2 on page 279 says that universal hash- ing provides the desired payoff: it becomes impossible for an adversary to pick a sequence of operations that forces the worst-case running time. Corollary 11.3 Using universal hashing and collision resolution by chaining in an initially empty table with m slots, it takes ‚.s/ expected time to handle any sequence of s I NSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE operations containing n D O.m/ I NSERT operations. Proof The I NSERT and DELETE operations take constant time. Since the num- ber n of insertions is O.m/, we have that ˛ D O.1/. Furthermore, the expected time for each SEARCH operation is O.1/, which can be seen by examining the proof of Theorem 11.2. That analysis depends only on collision probabilities, which are 1=m for any pair k 1 ; k 2 of keys by the choice of an independent uniform hash function in that theorem. Using a universal family of hash functions here instead of using independent uniform hashing changes the probability of collision from 1=m to at most 1=m. By linearity of expectation, therefore, the expected time for the entire sequence of s operations is O.s/. Since each operation takes �.1/ time, the ‚.s/ bound follows. 11.3.3 Achievable properties of random hashing There is a rich literature on the properties a family H of hash functions can have, and how they relate to the efûciency of hashing. We summarize a few of the most interesting ones here. Let H be a family of hash functions, each with domain U and range f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g, and let h be any hash function that is picked uniformly at random from H . The probabilities mentioned are probabilities over the picks of h.  The family H is uniform if for any key k in U and any slot q in the range f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g, the probability that h.k/ D q is 1=m.  The family H is universal if for any distinct keys k 1 and k 2 in U , the probability that h.k 1 / D h.k 2 / is at most 1=m.  The family H of hash functions is -universal if for any distinct keys k 1 and k 2 in U , the probability that h.k 1 / D h.k 2 / is at most � . Therefore, a universal family of hash functions is also 1=m-universal. 2 2 In the literature, a .c=m/-universal hash function is sometimes called c-universal or c-approxi- mately universal. We’ll stick with the notation .c=m/-universal. 288 Chapter 11 Hash Tables  The family H is d -independent if for any distinct keys k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k d in U and any slots q 1 , q 2 , . . . , q d , not necessarily distinct, in f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g the probability that h.k i / D q i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; d is 1=m d . Universal hash-function families are of particular interest, as they are the sim- plest type supporting provably efûcient hash-table operations for any input data set. Many other interesting and desirable properties, such as those noted above, are also possible and allow for efûcient specialized hash-table operations. 11.3.4 Designing a universal family of hash functions This section present two ways to design a universal (or � -universal) family of hash functions: one based on number theory and another based on a randomized variant of the multiply-shift method presented in Section 11.3.1. The ûrst method is a bit easier to prove universal, but the second method is newer and faster in practice. A universal family of hash functions based on number theory We can design a universal family of hash functions using a little number theory. You may wish to refer to Chapter 31 if you are unfamiliar with basic concepts in number theory. Begin by choosing a prime number p large enough so that every possible key k lies in the range 0 to p  1, inclusive. We assume here that p has a <reasonable= length. (See Section 11.3.5 for a discussion of methods for handling long input keys, such as variable-length strings.) Let Z p denote the set f0; 1; : : : ; p  1g, and let Z  p denote the set f1; 2; : : : ; p  1g. Since p is prime, we can solve equations modulo p with the methods given in Chapter 31. Because the size of the universe of keys is greater than the number of slots in the hash table (otherwise, just use direct addressing), we have p > m. Given any a 2 Z  p and any b 2 Z p , deûne the hash function h ab as a linear transformation followed by reductions modulo p and then modulo m: h ab .k/ D ..ak C b/ mod p/ mod m : (11.3) For example, with p D 17 and m D 6, we have h 3;4 .8/ D ..3  8 C 4/ mod 17/ mod 6 D .28 mod 17/ mod 6 D 11 mod 6 D 5 : Given p and m, the family of all such hash functions is H pm D ˚ h ab W a 2 Z  p and b 2 Z p  : (11.4) 11.3 Hash functions 289 Each hash function h ab maps Z p to Z m . This family of hash functions has the nice property that the size m of the output range (which is the size of the hash table) is arbitrary4it need not be prime. Since you can choose from among p  1 values for a and p values for b, the family H pm contains p.p  1/ hash functions. Theorem 11.4 The family H pm of hash functions deûned by equations (11.3) and (11.4) is uni- versal. Proof Consider two distinct keys k 1 and k 2 from Z p , so that k 1 ¤ k 2 . For a given hash function h ab , let r 1 D .ak 1 C b/ mod p ; r 2 D .ak 2 C b/ mod p : We ûrst note that r 1 ¤ r 2 . Why? Since we have r 1  r 2 D a.k 1  k 2 / .mod p/, it follows that r 1 ¤ r 2 because p is prime and both a and .k 1  k 2 / are nonzero modulo p. By Theorem 31.6 on page 908, their product must also be nonzero modulo p. Therefore, when computing any h ab 2 H pm , distinct inputs k 1 and k 2 map to distinct values r 1 and r 2 modulo p, and there are no collisions yet at the <mod p level.= Moreover, each of the possible p.p  1/ choices for the pair .a; b/ with a ¤ 0 yields a different resulting pair .r 1 ; r 2 / with r 1 ¤ r 2 , since we can solve for a and b given r 1 and r 2 : a D ã .r 1  r 2 /..k 1  k 2 / 1 mod p/ ä mod p ; b D .r 1  ak 1 / mod p ; where ..k 1  k 2 / 1 mod p/ denotes the unique multiplicative inverse, modulo p, of k 1  k 2 . For each of the p possible values of r 1 , there are only p  1 possible values of r 2 that do not equal r 1 , making only p.p  1/ possible pairs .r 1 ; r 2 / with r 1 ¤ r 2 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between pairs .a; b/ with a ¤ 0 and pairs .r 1 ; r 2 / with r 1 ¤ r 2 . Thus, for any given pair of distinct inputs k 1 and k 2 , if we pick .a; b/ uniformly at random from Z  p  Z p , the resulting pair .r 1 ; r 2 / is equally likely to be any pair of distinct values modulo p. Therefore, the probability that distinct keys k 1 and k 2 collide is equal to the probability that r 1 D r 2 .mod m/ when r 1 and r 2 are randomly chosen as distinct values modulo p. For a given value of r 1 , of the p  1 possible remaining values for r 2 , the number of values r 2 such that r 2 ¤ r 1 and r 2 D r 1 .mod m/ is at most l p m m  1 හ p C m  1 m  1 (by inequality (3.7) on page 64) D p  1 m : 290 Chapter 11 Hash Tables The probability that r 2 collides with r 1 when reduced modulo m is at most ..p  1/=m/=.p  1/ D 1=m, since r 2 is equally likely to be any of the p  1 values in Z p that are different from r 1 , but at most .p  1/=m of those values are equivalent to r 1 modulo m. Therefore, for any pair of distinct values k 1 ; k 2 2 Z p , Pr fh ab .k 1 / D h ab .k 2 /g හ 1=m ; so that H pm is indeed universal. A 2 =m-universal family of hash functions based on the multiply-shift method We recommend that in practice you use the following hash-function family based on the multiply-shift method. It is exceptionally efûcient and (although we omit the proof) provably 2=m-universal. Deûne H to be the family of multiply-shift hash functions with odd constants a: H D fh a W a is odd, 1 හ a < m, and h a is deûned by equation (11.2)g : (11.5) Theorem 11.5 The family of hash functions H given by equation (11.5) is 2=m-universal. That is, the probability that any two distinct keys collide is at most 2=m. In many practical situations, the speed of computing the hash function more than compensates for the higher upper bound on the probability that two distinct keys collide when compared with a universal hash function. 11.3.5 Hashing long inputs such as vectors or strings Sometimes hash function inputs are so long that they cannot be easily encoded modulo a reasonably sized prime number p or encoded within a single word of, say, 64 bits. As an example, consider the class of vectors, such as vectors of 8-bit bytes (which is how strings in many programming languages are stored). A vector might have an arbitrary nonnegative length, in which case the length of the input to the hash function may vary from input to input. Number-theoretic approaches One way to design good hash functions for variable-length inputs is to extend the ideas used in Section 11.3.4 to design universal hash functions. Exercise 11.3-6 explores one such approach. 11.3 Hash functions 291 Cryptographic hashing Another way to design a good hash function for variable-length inputs is to use a hash function designed for cryptographic applications. Cryptographic hash func- tions are complex pseudorandom functions, designed for applications requiring properties beyond those needed here, but are robust, widely implemented, and us- able as hash functions for hash tables. A cryptographic hash function takes as input an arbitrary byte string and returns a ûxed-length output. For example, the NIST standard deterministic cryptographic hash function SHA-256 [346] produces a 256-bit (32-byte) output for any input. Some chip manufacturers include instructions in their CPU architectures to pro- vide fast implementations of some cryptographic functions. Of particular inter- est are instructions that efûciently implement rounds of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the <AES-NI= instructions. These instructions execute in a few tens of nanoseconds, which is generally fast enough for use with hash tables. A message authentication code such as CBC-MAC based on AES and the use of the AES-NI instructions could be a useful and efûcient hash function. We don’t pursue the potential use of specialized instruction sets further here. Cryptographic hash functions are useful because they provide a way of imple- menting an approximate version of a random oracle. As noted earlier, a random oracle is equivalent to an independent uniform hash function family. From a the- oretical point of view, a random oracle is an unachievable ideal: a deterministic function that provides a randomly selected output for each input. Because it is de- terministic, it provides the same output if queried again for the same input. From a practical point of view, constructions of hash function families based on crypto- graphic hash functions are sensible substitutes for random oracles. There are many ways to use a cryptographic hash function as a hash function. For example, we could deûne h.k/ D SHA-256 .k/ mod m : To deûne a family of such hash functions one may prepend a <salt= string a to the input before hashing it, as in a .k/ D SHA-256 .a k k/ mod m ; where a k k denotes the string formed by concatenating the strings a and k. The lit- erature on message authentication codes (MACs) provides additional approaches. Cryptographic approaches to hash-function design are becoming more practi- cal as computers arrange their memories in hierarchies of differing capacities and speeds. Section 11.5 discusses one hash-function design based on the RC6 encryp- tion method. 292 Chapter 11 Hash Tables Exercises 11.3-1 You wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h.k/. Each key is a long character string. How might you take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key? 11.3-2 You hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. You can represent the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. How can you apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words of storage outside the string itself? 11.3-3 Consider a version of the division method in which h.k/ D k mod m, where m D 2 p  1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2 p . Show that if string x can be converted to string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function. 11.3-4 Consider a hash table of size m D 1000 and a corresponding hash function h.k/ D bm .kA mod 1/c for A D . p 5  1/=2. Compute the locations to which the keys 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65 are mapped. ? 11.3-5 Show that any � -universal family H of hash functions from a ûnite set U to a ûnite set Q has �  1= jQj  1= jU j. ? 11.3-6 Let U be the set of d -tuples of values drawn from Z p , and let Q D Z p , where p is prime. Deûne the hash function h b W U ! Q for b 2 Z p on an input d -tuple ha 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a d 1 i from U as h b .ha 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a d 1 i/ D  d 1 X j D0 a j b j ! mod p ; and let H D fh b W b 2 Z p g. Argue that H is � -universal for � D .d  1/=p. (Hint: See Exercise 31.4-4.) 11.4 Open addressing 293 11.4 Open addressing This section describes open addressing, a method for collision resolution that, un- like chaining, does not make use of storage outside of the hash table itself. In open addressing, all elements occupy the hash table itself. That is, each table entry con- tains either an element of the dynamic set or NIL. No lists or elements are stored outside the table, unlike in chaining. Thus, in open addressing, the hash table can <ûll up= so that no further insertions can be made. One consequence is that the load factor ˛ can never exceed 1. Collisions are handled as follows: when a new element is to be inserted into the table, it is placed in its <ûrst-choice= location if possible. If that location is already occupied, the new element is placed in its <second-choice= location. The process continues until an empty slot is found in which to place the new element. Different elements have different preference orders for the locations. To search for an element, systematically examine the preferred table slots for that element, in order of decreasing preference, until either you ûnd the desired element or you ûnd an empty slot and thus verify that the element is not in the table. Of course, you could use chaining and store the linked lists inside the hash table, in the otherwise unused hash-table slots (see Exercise 11.2-4), but the advantage of open addressing is that it avoids pointers altogether. Instead of following pointers, you compute the sequence of slots to be examined. The memory freed by not storing pointers provides the hash table with a larger number of slots in the same amount of memory, potentially yielding fewer collisions and faster retrieval. To perform insertion using open addressing, successively examine, or probe, the hash table until you ûnd an empty slot in which to put the key. Instead of being ûxed in the order 0; 1; : : : ; m  1 (which implies a ‚.n/ search time), the sequence of positions probed depends upon the key being inserted. To determine which slots to probe, the hash function includes the probe number (starting from 0) as a second input. Thus, the hash function becomes W U  f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g ! f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g : Open addressing requires that for every key k, the probe sequence hh.k; 0/; h.k; 1/; : : : ; h.k; m  1/i be a permutation of h0; 1; : : : ; m  1i, so that every hash-table position is eventually considered as a slot for a new key as the table ûlls up. The HASH-I NSERT procedure on the following page assumes that the elements in the hash table T are keys with no satellite information: the key k is identical to the element containing key k. Each slot contains either a key or NIL (if the slot is empty). The HASH-I NSERT procedure takes as input a hash table T and a key k 294 Chapter 11 Hash Tables that is assumed to be not already present in the hash table. It either returns the slot number where it stores key k or üags an error because the hash table is already full. HASH-I NSERT .T; k/ 1 i D 0 2 repeat 3 q D h.k; i / 4 if T Œq� == NIL 5 T Œq� D k 6 return q 7 else i D i C 1 8 until i == m 9 error <hash table overüow= HASH-SEARCH.T; k/ 1 i D 0 2 repeat 3 q D h.k; i / 4 if T Œq� == k 5 return q 6 i D i C 1 7 until T Œq� == NIL or i == m 8 return NIL The algorithm for searching for key k probes the same sequence of slots that the insertion algorithm examined when key k was inserted. Therefore, the search can terminate (unsuccessfully) when it ûnds an empty slot, since k would have been inserted there and not later in its probe sequence. The procedure H ASH-SEARCH takes as input a hash table T and a key k, returning q if it ûnds that slot q contains key k, or NIL if key k is not present in table T . Deletion from an open-address hash table is tricky. When you delete a key from slot q, it would be a mistake to mark that slot as empty by simply storing NIL in it. If you did, you might be unable to retrieve any key k for which slot q was probed and found occupied when k was inserted. One way to solve this problem is by marking the slot, storing in it the special value DELETED instead of NIL. The HASH-I NSERT procedure then has to treat such a slot as empty so that it can insert a new key there. The HASH-SEARCH procedure passes over DELETED values while searching, since slots containing DELETED were ûlled when the key being searched for was inserted. Using the special value DELETED, however, means that search times no longer depend on the load factor ˛, and for this reason chaining is 11.4 Open addressing 295 frequently selected as a collision resolution technique when keys must be deleted. There is a simple special case of open addressing, linear probing, that avoids the need to mark slots with DELETED. Section 11.5.1 shows how to delete from a hash table when using linear probing. In our analysis, we assume independent uniform permutation hashing (also confusingly known as uniform hashing in the literature): the probe sequence of each key is equally likely to be any of the mŠ permutations of h0; 1; : : : ; m  1i. Independent uniform permutation hashing generalizes the notion of independent uniform hashing deûned earlier to a hash function that produces not just a single slot number, but a whole probe sequence. True independent uniform permutation hashing is difûcult to implement, however, and in practice suitable approximations (such as double hashing, deûned below) are used. We’ll examine both double hashing and its special case, linear probing. These techniques guarantee that hh.k; 0/; h.k; 1/; : : : ; h.k; m  1/i is a permutation of h0; 1; : : : ; m  1i for each key k. (Recall that the second parameter to the hash function h is the probe number.) Neither double hashing nor linear probing meets the assumption of independent uniform permutation hashing, however. Double hashing cannot generate more than m 2 different probe sequences (instead of the mŠ that independent uniform permutation hashing requires). Nonetheless, double hashing has a large number of possible probe sequences and, as you might expect, seems to give good results. Linear probing is even more restricted, capable of generating only m different probe sequences. Double hashing Double hashing offers one of the best methods available for open addressing be- cause the permutations produced have many of the characteristics of randomly chosen permutations. Double hashing uses a hash function of the form h.k; i / D .h 1 .k/ C ih .k// mod m ; where both h 1 and h 2 are auxiliary hash functions. The initial probe goes to posi- tion T Œh 1 .k/�, and successive probe positions are offset from previous positions by the amount h 2 .k/, modulo m. Thus, the probe sequence here depends in two ways upon the key k, since the initial probe position h 1 .k/, the step size h 2 .k/, or both, may vary. Figure 11.5 gives an example of insertion by double hashing. In order for the entire hash table to be searched, the value h 2 .k/ must be rel- atively prime to the hash-table size m. (See Exercise 11.4-5.) A convenient way to ensure this condition is to let m be an exact power of 2 and to design h 2 so that it always produces an odd number. Another way is to let m be prime and to design h 2 so that it always returns a positive integer less than m. For example, you 296 Chapter 11 Hash Tables 0 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 79 69 98 72 14 50 Figure 11.5 Insertion by double hashing. The hash table has size 13 with h 1 .k/ D k mod 13 and h 2 .k/ D 1 C .k mod 11/. Since 14 D 1 .mod 13/ and 14 D 3 .mod 11/, the key 14 goes into empty slot 9, after slots 1 and 5 are examined and found to be occupied. could choose m prime and let h 1 .k/ D k mod m ; h 2 .k/ D 1 C .k mod m 0 / ; where m 0 is chosen to be slightly less than m (say, m  1). For example, if k D 123456, m D 701, and m 0 D 700, then h 1 .k/ D 80 and h 2 .k/ D 257, so that the ûrst probe goes to position 80, and successive probes examine every 257th slot (modulo m) until the key has been found or every slot has been examined. Although values of m other than primes or exact powers of 2 can in principle be used with double hashing, in practice it becomes more difûcult to efûciently generate h 2 .k/ (other than choosing h 2 .k/ D 1, which gives linear probing) in a way that ensures that it is relatively prime to m, in part because the relative density �.m/=m of such numbers for general m may be small (see equation (31.25) on page 921). When m is prime or an exact power of 2, double hashing produces ‚.m 2 / probe sequences, since each possible .h 1 .k/; h 2 .k// pair yields a distinct probe sequence. As a result, for such values of m, double hashing appears to perform close to the <ideal= scheme of independent uniform permutation hashing. 11.4 Open addressing 297 Linear probing Linear probing, a special case of double hashing, is the simplest open-addressing approach to resolving collisions. As with double hashing, an auxiliary hash func- tion h 1 determines the ûrst probe position h 1 .k/ for inserting an element. If slot T Œh 1 .k/� is already occupied, probe the next position T Œh 1 .k/ C 1�. Keep going as necessary, on up to slot T Œm  1�, and then wrap around to slots T Œ0�, T Œ1�, and so on, but never going past slot T Œh 1 .k/  1�. To view linear probing as a special case of double hashing, just set the double-hashing step function h 2 to be ûxed at 1: h 2 .k/ D 1 for all k. That is, the hash function is h.k; i / D .h 1 .k/ C i / mod m (11.6) for i D 0; 1; : : : ; m  1. The value of h 1 .k/ determines the entire probe sequence, and so assuming that h 1 .k/ can take on any value in f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g, linear prob- ing allows only m distinct probe sequences. We’ll revisit linear probing in Section 11.5.1. Analysis of open-address hashing As in our analysis of chaining in Section 11.2, we analyze open addressing in terms of the load factor ˛ D n=m of the hash table. With open addressing, at most one element occupies each slot, and thus n හ m, which implies ˛ හ 1. The analysis below requires ˛ to be strictly less than 1, and so we assume that at least one slot is empty. Because deleting from an open-address hash table does not really free up a slot, we assume as well that no deletions occur. For the hash function, we assume independent uniform permutation hashing. In this idealized scheme, the probe sequence hh.k; 0/; h.k; 1/; : : : ; h.k; m  1/i used to insert or search for each key k is equally likely to be any permutation of h0; 1; : : : ; m  1i. Of course, any given key has a unique ûxed probe sequence associated with it. What we mean here is that, considering the probability distribution on the space of keys and the operation of the hash function on the keys, each possible probe sequence is equally likely. We now analyze the expected number of probes for hashing with open address- ing under the assumption of independent uniform permutation hashing, beginning with the expected number of probes made in an unsuccessful search (assuming, as stated above, that ˛ < 1). The bound proven, of 1=.1  ˛/ D 1 C ˛ C ˛ 2 C ˛ 3 C   , has an intuitive in- terpretation. The ûrst probe always occurs. With probability approximately ˛, the ûrst probe ûnds an occupied slot, so that a second probe happens. With probability approximately ˛ 2 , the ûrst two slots are occupied so that a third probe ensues, and so on. 298 Chapter 11 Hash Tables Theorem 11.6 Given an open-address hash table with load factor ˛ D n=m < 1 , the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search is at most 1=.1  ˛/, assuming inde- pendent uniform permutation hashing and no deletions. Proof In an unsuccessful search, every probe but the last accesses an occupied slot that does not contain the desired key, and the last slot probed is empty. Let the random variable X denote the number of probes made in an unsuccessful search, and deûne the event A i , for i D 1; 2; : : :, as the event that an i th probe occurs and it is to an occupied slot. Then the event fX  i g is the intersection of events A 1 \\A 2 \\  \\A i 1 . We bound Pr fX  i g by bounding Pr fA 1 \\ A 2 \\    \\ A i 1 g.

For j > 1, the probability that there is a j th probe and it is to an occupied slot, given that the ûrst j  1 probes were to occupied slots, is .n  j C 1/=.m  j C 1/. This probability follows because the j th probe would be ûnding one of the remaining .n  .j  1// elements in one of the .m  .j  1// unexamined slots, and by the assumption of independent uniform permutation hashing, the probability is the ratio of these quantities. Since n < m implies that .n  j /=.m  j / හ n=m for all j in the range 0 හ j < m, it follows that for all i in the range 1 හ i හ m, we have Pr fX  i g D n m  n  1 m  1  n  2 m  2    n  i C 2 m  i C 2 හ  n m Í i 1 D ˛ i 1 : The product in the ûrst line has i  1 factors. When i D 1, the product is 1, the identity for multiplication, and we get Pr fX  1g D 1, which makes sense, since there must always be at least 1 probe. If each of the ûrst n probes is to an occupied slot, then all occupied slots have been probed. Then, the .n C 1/st probe must be to an empty slot, which gives Pr fX  i g D 0 for i > n C 1. Now, we use equation (C.28) on page 1193 to bound the expected number of probes: E ŒX � D 1 X i D1 Pr fX  i g D nC1 X i D1 Pr fX  i g C X i >nC1 Pr fX  i g 11.4 Open addressing 299 හ 1 X i D1 ˛ i 1 C 0 D 1 X i D0 ˛ i D 1 1  ˛ (by equation (A.7) on page 1142 because 0 හ ˛ < 1) . If ˛ is a constant, Theorem 11.6 predicts that an unsuccessful search runs in O.1/ time. For example, if the hash table is half full, the average number of probes in an unsuccessful search is at most 1=.1  :5/ D 2. If it is 90% full, the average number of probes is at most 1=.1  :9/ D 10. Theorem 11.6 yields almost immediately how well the H ASH-I NSERT procedure performs. Corollary 11.7 Inserting an element into an open-address hash table with load factor ˛, where ˛ < 1, requires at most 1=.1  ˛/ probes on average, assuming independent uni- form permutation hashing and no deletions. Proof An element is inserted only if there is room in the table, and thus ˛ < 1. Inserting a key requires an unsuccessful search followed by placing the key into the ûrst empty slot found. Thus, the expected number of probes is at most 1=.1  ˛/. It takes a little more work to compute the expected number of probes for a suc- cessful search. Theorem 11.8 Given an open-address hash table with load factor ˛ < 1, the expected number of probes in a successful search is at most 1 ˛ ln 1 1  ˛ ; assuming independent uniform permutation hashing with no deletions and assum- ing that each key in the table is equally likely to be searched for. Proof A search for a key k reproduces the same probe sequence as when the element with key k was inserted. If k was the .i C 1/st key inserted into the hash table, then the load factor at the time it was inserted was i=m, and so by Corollary 11.7, the expected number of probes made in a search for k is at most 1=.1  i=m/ D m=.m  i /. Averaging over all n keys in the hash table gives us 300 Chapter 11 Hash Tables the expected number of probes in a successful search: 1 n n1 X i D0 m m  i D m n n1 X i D0 1 m  i D 1 ˛ m X kDmnC1 1 k හ 1 ˛ Z m mn 1 x dx (by inequality (A.19) on page 1150) D 1 ˛ .ln m  ln.m  n// D 1 ˛ ln m m  n D 1 ˛ ln 1 1  ˛ : If the hash table is half full, the expected number of probes in a successful search is less than 1:387. If the hash table is 90% full, the expected number of probes is less than 2:559. If ˛ D 1, then in an unsuccessful search, all m slots must be probed. Exercise 11.4-4 asks you to analyze a successful search when ˛ D 1. Exercises 11.4-1 Consider inserting the keys 10; 22; 31; 4; 15; 28; 17; 88; 59 into a hash table of length m D 11 using open addressing. Illustrate the result of inserting these keys using linear probing with h.k; i / D .k C i / mod m and using double hashing with h 1 .k/ D k and h 2 .k/ D 1 C .k mod .m  1//. 11.4-2 Write pseudocode for HASH-DELETE that ûlls the deleted key’s slot with the spe- cial value DELETED, and modify HASH-SEARCH and HASH-I NSERT as needed to handle DELETED. 11.4-3 Consider an open-address hash table with independent uniform permutation hash- ing and no deletions. Give upper bounds on the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search and on the expected number of probes in a successful search when the load factor is 3=4 and when it is 7=8. 11.5 Practical considerations 301 11.4-4 Show that the expected number of probes required for a successful search when ˛ D 1 (that is, when n D m), is H m , the mth harmonic number. ? 11.4-5 Show that, with double hashing, if m and h 2 .k/ have greatest common divisor d  1 for some key k, then an unsuccessful search for key k examines .1=d /th of the hash table before returning to slot h 1 .k/. Thus, when d D 1, so that m and h 2 .k/ are relatively prime, the search may examine the entire hash table. (Hint: See Chapter 31.) ? 11.4-6 Consider an open-address hash table with a load factor ˛. Approximate the nonzero value ˛ for which the expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search equals twice the expected number of probes in a successful search. Use the upper bounds given by Theorems 11.6 and 11.8 for these expected numbers of probes. 11.5 Practical considerations Efûcient hash table algorithms are not only of theoretical interest, but also of im- mense practical importance. Constant factors can matter. For this reason, this section discusses two aspects of modern CPUs that are not included in the standard RAM model presented in Section 2.2: Memory hierarchies: The memory of modern CPUs has a number of levels, from the fast registers, through one or more levels of cache memory, to the main-memory level. Each successive level stores more data than the previous level, but access is slower. As a consequence, a complex computation (such as a complicated hash function) that works entirely within the fast registers can take less time than a single read operation from main memory. Furthermore, cache memory is organized in cache blocks of (say) 64 bytes each, which are always fetched together from main memory. There is a substantial beneût for ensuring that memory usage is local: reusing the same cache block is much more efûcient than fetching a different cache block from main memory. The standard RAM model measures efûciency of a hash-table operation by counting the number of hash-table slots probed. In practice, this metric is only a crude approximation to the truth, since once a cache block is in the cache, successive probes to that cache block are much faster than probes that must access main memory. 302 Chapter 11 Hash Tables Advanced instruction sets: Modern CPUs may have sophisticated instruction sets that implement advanced primitives useful for encryption or other forms of cryptography. These instructions may be useful in the design of exception- ally efûcient hash functions. Section 11.5.1 discusses linear probing, which becomes the collision-resolution method of choice in the presence of a memory hierarchy. Section 11.5.2 suggests how to construct <advanced= hash functions based on cryptographic primitives, suitable for use on computers with hierarchical memory models. 11.5.1 Linear probing Linear probing is often disparaged because of its poor performance in the standard RAM model. But linear probing excels for hierarchical memory models, because successive probes are usually to the same cache block of memory. Deletion with linear probing Another reason why linear probing is often not used in practice is that deletion seems complicated or impossible without using the special DELETED value. Yet we’ll now see that deletion from a hash table based on linear probing is not all that difûcult, even without the DELETED marker. The deletion procedure works for linear probing, but not for open-address probing in general, because with lin- ear probing keys all follow the same simple cyclic probing sequence (albeit with different starting points). The deletion procedure relies on an <inverse= function to the linear-probing hash function h.k; i / D .h 1 .k/ C i / mod m, which maps a key k and a probe number i to a slot number in the hash table. The inverse function g maps a key k and a slot number q, where 0 හ q < m, to the probe number that reaches slot q: g.k; q/ D .q  h 1 .k// mod m : If h.k; i / D q, then g.k; q/ D i , and so h.k; g.k; q// D q. The procedure LINEAR-PROBING-HASH-DELETE on the facing page deletes the key stored in position q from hash table T . Figure 11.6 shows how it works. The procedure ûrst deletes the key in position q by setting T Œq� to NIL in line 2. It then searches for a slot q 0 (if any) that contains a key that should be moved to the slot q just vacated by key k. Line 9 asks the critical question: does the key k 0 in slot q 0 need to be moved to the vacated slot q in order to preserve the accessibility of k 0 ? If g.k 0 ; q/ < g.k 0 ; q 0 /, then during the insertion of k 0 into the table, slot q was examined but found to be already occupied. But now slot q, where a search will look for k 0 , is empty. In this case, key k 0 moves to slot q in line 10, and the 11.5 Practical considerations 303 0 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 82 74 93 18 38 43 (a) 0 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 82 74 93 (b) 92 92 18 38 Figure 11.6 Deletion in a hash table that uses linear probing.

Long runs of occupied slots build up, increasing the average 304 Chapter 11 Hash Tables search time. Clusters arise because an empty slot preceded by i full slots gets ûlled next with probability .i C 1/=m. Long runs of occupied slots tend to get longer, and the average search time increases. In the standard RAM model, primary clustering is a problem, and general dou- ble hashing usually performs better than linear probing. By contrast, in a hierar- chical memory model, primary clustering is a beneûcial property, as elements are often stored together in the same cache block. Searching proceeds through one cache block before advancing to search the next cache block. With linear prob- ing, the running time for a key k of HASH-I NSERT, HASH-SEARCH, or LINEAR- PROBING-HASH-DELETE is at most proportional to the distance from h 1 .k/ to the next empty slot. The following theorem is due to Pagh et al. [351]. A more recent proof is given by Thorup [438]. We omit the proof here. The need for 5-independence is by no means obvious; see the cited proofs. Theorem 11.9 If h 1 is 5-independent and ˛ හ 2=3, then it takes expected constant time to search for, insert, or delete a key in a hash table using linear probing. (Indeed, the expected operation time is O.1=� 2 / for ˛ D 1  � .) ? 11.5.2 Hash functions for hierarchical memory models This section illustrates an approach for designing efûcient hash tables in a modern computer system having a memory hierarchy. Because of the memory hierarchy, linear probing is a good choice for resolving collisions, as probe sequences are sequential and tend to stay within cache blocks. But linear probing is most efûcient when the hash function is complex (for exam- ple, 5-independent as in Theorem 11.9). Fortunately, having a memory hierarchy means that complex hash functions can be implemented efûciently. As noted in Section 11.3.5, one approach is to use a cryptographic hash func- tion such as SHA-256. Such functions are complex and sufûciently random for hash table applications. On machines with specialized instructions, cryptographic functions can be quite efûcient. Instead, we present here a simple hash function based only on addition, multi- plication, and swapping the halves of a word. This function can be implemented entirely within the fast registers, and on a machine with a memory hierarchy, its latency is small compared with the time taken to access a random slot of the hash table. It is related to the RC 6 encryption algorithm and can f or practical purposes be considered a <random oracle.= 11.5 Practical considerations 305 The wee hash function Let w denote the word size of the machine (e.g., w D 64), assumed to be even, and let a and b be w-bit unsigned (nonnegative) integers such that a is odd. Let swap.x/ denote the w-bit result of swapping the two w=2-bit halves of w-bit in- put x . That is, swap.x/ D .x o .w=2// C .x n .w=2// where <o= is <logical right shift= (as in equation (11.2)) and <n is <left shift.= Deûne f a .k/ D swap..2k 2 C ak/ mod 2 w / : Thus, to compute f a .k/, evaluate the quadratic function 2k 2 C ak modulo 2 w and then swap the left and right halves of the result. Let r denote a desired number of <rounds= for the computation of the hash func- tion. We’ll use r D 4, but the hash function is well deûned for any nonnegative r . Denote by f .r/ a .k/ the result of iterating f a a total of r times (that is, r rounds) starting with input value k. For any odd a and any r  0, the function f .r/ a , al- though complicated, is one-to-one (see Exercise 11.5-1). A cryptographer would view f .r/ a as a simple block cipher operating on w-bit input blocks, with r rounds and key a. We ûrst deûne the wee hash function h for short inputs, where by <short= we means <whose length t is at most w-bits,= so that the input ûts within one computer word. We would like inputs of different lengths to be hashed differently. The wee hash function h a;b;t;r .k/ for parameters a, b, and r on t -bit input k is deûned as h a;b;t;r .k/ D ã f .r/ aC2t .k C b/ ä mod m : (11.7) That is, the hash value for t -bit input k is obtained by applying f .r/ aC2t to k C b, then taking the ûnal result modulo m. Adding the value b provides hash-dependent randomization of the input, in a way that ensures that for variable-length inputs the 0-length input does not have a ûxed hash value. Adding the value 2t to a ensures that the hash function acts differently for inputs of different lengths. (We use 2t rather than t to ensure that the key a C 2t is odd if a is odd.) We call this hash function <wee= because it uses a tiny amount of memory4more precisely, it can be implemented efûciently using only the computer’s fast registers. (This hash function does not have a name in the literature; it is a variant we developed for this textbook.) Speed of the wee hash function It is surprising how much efûciency can be bought with locality. Experiments (un- published, by the authors) suggest that evaluating the wee hash function takes less 306 Chapter 11 Hash Tables time than probing a single randomly chosen slot in a hash table. These experi- ments were run on a laptop (2019 MacBook Pro) with w D 64 and a D 123. For large hash tables, evaluating the wee hash function was 2 to 10 times faster than performing a single probe of the hash table. The wee hash function for variable-length inputs Sometimes inputs are long4more than one w-bit word in length4or have variable length, as discussed in Section 11.3.5. We can extend the wee hash function, de- ûned above for inputs that are at most single w-bit word in length, to handle long or variable-length inputs. Here is one method for doing so. Suppose that an input k has length t (measured in bits). Break k into a sequence hk 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k u i of w-bit words, where u D dt=we, k 1 contains the least-signiûcant w bits of k, and k u contains the most signiûcant bits. If t is not a multiple of w, then k u contains fewer than w bits, in which case, pad out the unused high-order bits of k u with 0-bits. Deûne the function chop to return a sequence of the w-bit words in k: chop.k/ D hk 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k u i : The most important property of the chop operation is that it is one-to-one, given t : for any two t -bit keys k and k 0 , if k ¤ k 0 then chop.k/ ¤ chop.k 0 /, and k can be derived from chop.k/ and t . The chop operation also has the useful property that a single-word input key yields a single-word output sequence: chop.k/ D hki. With the chop function in hand, we specify the wee hash function h a;b;t;r .k/ for an input k of length t bits as follows: h a;b;t;r .k/ D WEE.k; a; b; t; r; m/ ; where the procedure WEE deûned on the facing page iterates through the elements of the w-bit words returned by chop.k/, applying f r a to the sum of the current word k i and the previously computed hash value so far, ûnally returning the result obtained modulo m. This deûnition for variable-length and long (multiple-word) inputs is a consistent extension of the deûnition in equation (11.7) for short (single- word) inputs. For practical use, we recommend that a be a randomly chosen odd w-bit word, b be a randomly chosen w-bit word, and that r D 4. Note that the wee hash function is really a hash function family, with individ- ual hash functions determined by parameters a; b; t; r; and m. The (approximate) 5-independence of the wee hash function family for variable-length inputs can be argued based on the assumption that the 1-word wee hash function is a random or- acle and on the security of the cipher-block-chaining message authentication code (CBC-MAC), as studied by Bellare et al. [42]. The case here is actually simpler than that studied in the literature, since if two messages have different lengths t and t 0 , then their <keys= are different: a C 2t ¤ a C 2t 0 . We omit the details. 11.5 Practical considerations 307 WEE.k; a; b; t; r; m/ 1 u D dt=we 2 hk 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k u i D chop.k/ 3 q D b 4 for i D 1 to u 5 q D f .r/ aC2t .k i C q/ 6 return q mod m This deûnition of a cryptographically inspired hash-function family is meant to be realistic, yet only illustrative, and many variations and improvements are possible. See the chapter notes for suggestions. In summary, we see that when the memory system is hierarchical, it becomes advantageous to use linear probing (a special case of double hashing), since suc- cessive probes tend to stay in the same cache block. Furthermore, hash functions that can be implemented using only the computer’s fast registers are exceptionally efûcient, so they can be quite complex and even cryptographically inspired, pro- viding the high degree of independence needed for linear probing to work most efûciently.

Show that the expected length E ŒX � of the longest probe sequence is O.lg n/. 11-2 Searching a static set You are asked to implement a searchable set of n elements in which the keys are numbers. The set is static (no I NSERT or DELETE operations), and the only opera- tion required is SEARCH. You are given an arbitrary amount of time to preprocess the n elements so that SEARCH operations run quickly. a. Show how to implement SEARCH in O.lg n/ worst-case time using no extra storage beyond what is needed to store the elements of the set themselves. b. Consider implementing the set by open-address hashing on m slots, and assume independent uniform permutation hashing. What is the minimum amount of ex- tra storage m  n required to make the average performance of an unsuccessful SEARCH operation be at least as good as the bound in part (a)? Your answer should be an asymptotic bound on m  n in terms of n. 11-3 Slot-size bound for chaining Given a hash table with n slots, with collisions resolved by chaining, suppose that n keys are inserted into the table. Each key is equally likely to be hashed to each slot. Let M be the maximum number of keys in any slot after all the keys have Problems for Chapter 11 309 been inserted.

Show that H is universal, but not 2-independent. (Hint: Find a key for which all hash functions in H produce the same value.) 310 Chapter 11 Hash Tables c.

Alice and Bob secretly agree on a hash function h from a 2-independent fam- ily H of hash functions. Each h 2 H maps from a universe of keys U to Z p , where p is prime. Later, Alice sends a message m to Bob over the internet, where m 2 U . She authenticates this message to Bob by also sending an au- thentication tag t D h.m/, and Bob checks that the pair .m; t/ he receives indeed satisûes t D h.m/. Suppose that an adversary intercepts .m; t/ en route and tries to fool Bob by replacing the pair .m; t/ with a different pair .m 0 ; t 0 /. Argue that the probability that the adversary succeeds in fooling Bob into ac- cepting .m 0 ; t 0 / is at most 1=p, no matter how much computing power the ad- versary has, even if the adversary knows the family H of hash functions used. Chapter notes The books by Knuth [261] and Gonnet and Baeza-Yates [193] are excellent ref- erences for the analysis of hashing algorithms. Knuth credits H. P. Luhn (1953) for inventing hash tables, along with the chaining method for resolving collisions. At about the same time, G. M. Amdahl originated the idea of open addressing. The notion of a random oracle was introduced by Bellare et al. [43]. Carter and Wegman [80] introduced the notion of universal families of hash functions in 1979. Dietzfelbinger et al. [113] invented the multiply-shift hash function and gave a proof of Theorem 11.5. Thorup [437] provides extensions and additional analysis. Thorup [438] gives a simple proof that linear probing with 5-independent hashing takes constant expected time per operation. Thorup also describes the method for deletion in a hash table using linear probing. Fredman, Koml´ os, and Szemer´ edi [154] developed a perfect hashing scheme for static sets4<perfect= because all collisions are avoided. An extension of their method to dynamic sets, handling insertions and deletions in amortized expected time O.1/, has been given by Dietzfelbinger et al. [114]. The wee hash function is based on the RC6 encryption algorithm [379]. Leiser- son et al. [292] propose an <RC 6MIX= function that is essentially the same as the Notes for Chapter 11 311 wee hash function. They give experimental evidence that it has good randomness, and they also give a <DOTMIX= function for dealing with variable-length inputs. Bellare et al. [42] provide an analysis of the security of the cipher-block-chaining message authentication code. This analysis implies that the wee hash function has the desired pseudorandomness properties. 12 Binary Search Trees The search tree data structure supports each of the dynamic-set operations listed on page 250: SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, PREDECESSOR, SUCCESSOR, I NSERT, and DELETE. Thus, you can use a search tree both as a dictionary and as a priority queue. Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree with n nodes, such operations run in ‚.lg n/ worst-case time. If the tree is a linear chain of n nodes, however, the same oper- ations take ‚.n/ worst-case time. In Chapter 13, we’ll see a variation of binary search trees, red-black trees, whose operations guarantee a height of O.lg n/. We won’t prove it here, but if you build a binary search tree on a random set of n keys, its expected height is O.lg n/ even if you don’t try to limit its height. After presenting the basic properties of binary search trees, the following sec- tions show how to walk a binary search tree to print its values in sorted order, how to search for a value in a binary search tree, how to ûnd the minimum or maximum element, how to ûnd the predecessor or successor of an element, and how to insert into or delete from a binary search tree. The basic mathematical properties of trees appear in Appendix B. 12.1 What is a binary search tree? A binary search tree is organized, as the name suggests, in a binary tree, as shown in Figure 12.1. You can represent such a tree with a linked data structure, as in Section 10.3. In addition to a key and satellite data, each node object contains attributes left , right , and p that point to the nodes corresponding to its left child, its right child, and its parent, respectively. If a child or the parent is missing, the appropriate attribute contains the value NIL. The tree itself has an attribute root 12.1 What is a binary search tree? 313 5 2 5 5 8 7 6 (a) 6 8 7 5 2 (b) 6 5 7 2 5 8 2 5 7 6 8 5 T: root T: root Figure 12.1 Binary search trees. For any node x, the keys in the left subtree of x are at most x: key, and the keys in the right subtree of x are at least x: key. Different binary search trees can represent the same set of values. The worst-case running time for most search-tree operations is proportional to the height of the tree. (a) A binary search tree on 6 nodes with height 2. The top ûgure shows how to view the tree conceptually, and the bottom ûgure shows the left, right, and p attributes in each node, in the style of Figure 10.6 on page 266. (b) A less efûcient binary search tree, with height 4, that contains the same keys. that points to the root node, or NIL if the tree is empty. The root node T: root is the only node in a tree T whose parent is NIL. The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the binary-search-tree property: 314 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x , then y: key හ x: key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x , then y: key  x: key. Thus, in Figure 12.1(a), the key of the root is 6, the keys 2, 5, and 5 in its left subtree are no larger than 6, and the keys 7 and 8 in its right subtree are no smaller than 6. The same property holds for every node in the tree. For example, looking at the root’s left child as the root of a subtree, this subtree root has the key 5, the key 2 in its left subtree is no larger than 5, and the key 5 in its right subtree is no smaller than 5. Because of the binary-search-tree property, you can print out all the keys in a binary search tree in sorted order by a simple recursive algorithm, called an inorder tree walk, given by the procedure I NORDER-TREE-WALK. This algorithm is so named because it prints the key of the root of a subtree between printing the values in its left subtree and printing those in its right subtree. (Similarly, a preorder tree walk prints the root before the values in either subtree, and a postorder tree walk prints the root after the values in its subtrees.) To print all the elements in a binary search tree T , call I NORDER-TREE-WALK .T: root /. For example, the inorder tree walk prints the keys in each of the two binary search trees from Figure 12.1 in the order 2; 5; 5; 6; 7; 8.

The following theorem gives a formal proof that it takes linear time to perform an inorder tree walk. Theorem 12.1 If x is the root of an n-node subtree, then the call I NORDER-TREE-WALK .x/ takes ‚.n/ time. Proof Let T .n/ denote the time taken by I NORDER-TREE-WALK when it is called on the root of an n-node subtree. Since I NORDER-TREE-WALK visits all n nodes of the subtree, we have T .n/ D �.n/. It remains to show that T .n/ D O.n/. 12.1 What is a binary search tree? 315 Since I NORDER-TREE-WALK takes a small, constant amount of time on an empty subtree (for the test x ¤ NIL), we have T .0/ D c for some constant c > 0.

Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an n-node tree in sorted order in O.n/ time? Show how, or explain why not. 12.1-3 Give a nonrecursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk. (Hint: An easy solution uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure. A more complicated, but ele- gant, solution uses no stack but assumes that you can test two pointers for equality.) 12.1-4 Give recursive algorithms that perform preorder and postorder tree walks in ‚.n/ time on a tree of n nodes. 12.1-5 Argue that since sorting n elements takes �.n lg n/ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of n elements takes �.n lg n/ time in the worst case. 316 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees 12.2 Querying a binary search tree Binary search trees can support the queries M INIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR, as well as SEARCH. This section examines these operations and shows how to support each one in O.h/ time on any binary search tree of height h. Searching To search for a node with a given key in a binary search tree, call the T REE- SEARCH procedure. Given a pointer x to the root of a subtree and a key k, TREE-SEARCH .x; k/ returns a pointer to a node with key k if one exists in the subtree; otherwise, it returns NIL. To search for key k in the entire binary search tree T , call TREE-SEARCH .T: root ; k/. TREE-SEARCH .x; k/ 1 if x == NIL or k == x: key 2 return x 3 if k < x: key 4 return TREE-SEARCH.x: left; k/ 5 else return TREE-SEARCH.x: right ; k/ I TERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH .x; k/ 1 while x ¤ NIL and k ¤ x: key 2 if k < x: key 3 x D x: left 4 else x D x: right 5 return x The TREE-SEARCH procedure begins its search at the root and traces a simple path downward in the tree, as shown in Figure 12.2(a). For each node x it encoun- ters, it compares the key k with x: key. If the two keys are equal, the search termi- nates. If k is smaller than x: key, the search continues in the left subtree of x , since the binary-search-tree property implies that k cannot reside in the right subtree. Symmetrically, if k is larger than x: key, the search continues in the right subtree. The nodes encountered during the recursion form a simple path downward from the root of the tree, and thus the running time of T REE-SEARCH is O.h/, where h is the height of the tree. 12.2 Querying a binary search tree 317 2 4 3 13 7 6 17 20 18 15 9 (a) 2 4 3 13 7 6 17 20 18 15 9 (b) 2 4 3 13 7 6 17 20 18 15 9 (c) 2 4 3 13 7 6 17 20 18 15 9 (d) Figure 12.2 Queries on a binary search tree. Nodes and paths followed in each query are colored blue. (a) A search for the key 13 in the tree follows the path 15 ! 6 ! 7 ! 13 from the root. (b) The minimum key in the tree is 2, which is found by following left pointers from the root. The maximum key 20 is found by following right pointers from the root. (c) The successor of the node with key 15 is the node with key 17, since it is the minimum key in the right subtree of 15. (d) The node with key 13 has no right subtree, and thus its successor is its lowest ancestor whose left child is also an ancestor. In this case, the node with key 15 is its successor. Since the TREE-SEARCH procedure recurses on either the left subtree or the right subtree, but not both, we can rewrite the algorithm to <unroll= the recursion into a while loop. On most computers, the I TERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH procedure on the facing page is more efûcient. Minimum and maximum To ûnd an element in a binary search tree whose key is a minimum, just follow left child pointers from the root until you encounter a NIL, as shown in Figure 12.2(b). 318 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees The TREE-MINIMUM procedure returns a pointer to the minimum element in the subtree rooted at a given node x , which we assume to be non-NIL. TREE-MINIMUM.x/ 1 while x: left ¤ NIL 2 x D x: left 3 return x TREE-MAXIMUM.x/ 1 while x: right ¤ NIL 2 x D x: right 3 return x The binary-search-tree property guarantees that T REE-MINIMUM is correct. If node x has no left subtree, then since every key in the right subtree of x is at least as large as x: key, the minimum key in the subtree rooted at x is x: key. If node x has a left subtree, then since no key in the right subtree is smaller than x: key and every key in the left subtree is not larger than x: key, the minimum key in the subtree rooted at x resides in the subtree rooted at x: left. The pseudocode for TREE-MAXIMUM is symmetric. Both TREE-MINIMUM and TREE-MAXIMUM run in O.h/ time on a tree of height h since, as in TREE- SEARCH, the sequence of nodes encountered forms a simple path downward from the root. Successor and predecessor Given a node in a binary search tree, how can you ûnd its successor in the sorted order determined by an inorder tree walk? If all keys are distinct, the successor of a node x is the node with the smallest key greater than x: key. Regardless of whether the keys are distinct, we deûne the successor of a node as the next node visited in an inorder tree walk. The structure of a binary search tree allows you to determine the successor of a node without comparing keys. The T REE-SUCCESSOR procedure on the facing page returns the successor of a node x in a binary search tree if it exists, or NIL if x is the last node that would be visited during an inorder walk. The code for TREE-SUCCESSOR has two cases. If the right subtree of node x is nonempty, then the successor of x is just the leftmost node in x ’s right subtree, which line 2 ûnds by calling TREE-MINIMUM.x: right /. For example, the succes- sor of the node with key 15 in Figure 12.2(c) is the node with key 17. On the other hand, as Exercise 12.2-6 asks you to show, if the right subtree of node x is empty and x has a successor y , then y is the lowest ancestor of x whose 12.2 Querying a binary search tree 319 TREE-SUCCESSOR.x/ 1 if x: right ¤ NIL 2 return TREE-MINIMUM.x: right / // leftmost node in right subtree 3 else // ûnd the lowest ancestor of x whose left child is an ancestor of x 4 y D x: p 5 while y ¤ NIL and x == y: right 6 x D y 7 y D y: p 8 return y left child is also an ancestor of x . In Figure 12.2(d), the successor of the node with key 13 is the node with key 15. To ûnd y , go up the tree from x until you encounter either the root or a node that is the left child of its parent. Lines 438 of TREE-SUCCESSOR handle this case. The running time of TREE-SUCCESSOR on a tree of height h is O.h/, since it either follows a simple path up the tree or follows a simple path down the tree. The procedure TREE-PREDECESSOR, which is symmetric to TREE-SUCCESSOR, also runs in O.h/ time. In summary, we have proved the following theorem. Theorem 12.2 The dynamic-set operations SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR can be implemented so that each one runs in O.h/ time on a binary search tree of height h. Exercises 12.2-1 You are searching for the number 363 in a binary search tree containing numbers between 1 and 1000.

Suppose that the search for key k in a binary search tree ends up at a leaf. Consider three sets: A, the keys to the left of the search path; B , the keys on the search path; and C , the keys to the right of the search path. Professor Kilmer claims that any three keys a 2 A, b 2 B , and c 2 C must satisfy a හ b හ c . Give a smallest possible counterexample to the professor’s claim. 12.2-5 Show that if a node in a binary search tree has two children, then its successor has no left child and its predecessor has no right child. 12.2-6 Consider a binary search tree T whose keys are distinct. Show that if the right subtree of a node x in T is empty and x has a successor y , then y is the lowest ancestor of x whose left child is also an ancestor of x . (Recall that every node is its own ancestor.) 12.2-7 An alternative method of performing an inorder tree walk of an n-node binary search tree ûnds the minimum element in the tree by calling TREE-MINIMUM and then making n  1 calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR. Prove that this algorithm runs in ‚.n/ time. 12.2-8 Prove that no matter what node you start at in a height-h binary search tree, k successive calls to TREE-SUCCESSOR take O.k C h/ time. 12.2-9 Let T be a binary search tree whose keys are distinct, let x be a leaf node, and let y be its parent. Show that y: key is either the smallest key in T larger than x: key or the largest key in T smaller than x: key. 12.3 Insertion and deletion 321 12.3 Insertion and deletion The operations of insertion and deletion cause the dynamic set represented by a binary search tree to change. The data structure must be modiûed to reüect this change, but in such a way that the binary-search-tree property continues to hold. We’ll see that modifying the tree to insert a new element is relatively straightfor- ward, but deleting a node from a binary search tree is more complicated. Insertion The TREE-I NSERT procedure inserts a new node into a binary search tree. The procedure takes a binary search tree T and a node ´ for which ´: key has already been ûlled in, ´: left D NIL, and ´: right D NIL. It modiûes T and some of the attributes of ´ so as to insert ´ into an appropriate position in the tree. TREE-I NSERT .T; ´/ 1 x D T: root // node being compared with ´ 2 y D NIL // y will be parent of ´ 3 while x ¤ NIL // descend until reaching a leaf 4 y D x 5 if ´: key < x: key 6 x D x: left 7 else x D x: right 8 ´: p D y // found the location4insert ´ with parent y 9 if y == NIL 10 T: root D ´ // tree T was empty 11 elseif ´: key < y: key 12 y: left D ´ 13 else y: right D ´ Figure 12.3 shows how TREE-I NSERT works. Just like the procedures TREE- SEARCH and I TERATIVE-T REE-SEARCH, TREE-I NSERT begins at the root of the tree and the pointer x traces a simple path downward looking for a NIL to replace with the input node ´. The procedure maintains the trailing pointer y as the parent of x . After initialization, the while loop in lines 337 causes these two pointers to move down the tree, going left or right depending on the comparison of ´: key with x: key, until x becomes NIL. This NIL occupies the position where node ´ will go. More precisely, this NIL is a left or right attribute of the node that will become ´’s parent, or it is T: root if tree T is currently empty. The procedure needs the 322 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees 2 9 5 13 17 15 19 18 12 Figure 12.3 Inserting a node with key 13 into a binary search tree. The simple path from the root down to the position where the node is inserted is shown in blue. The new node and the link to its parent are highlighted in orange. trailing pointer y , because by the time it ûnds the NIL where ´ belongs, the search has proceeded one step beyond the node that needs to be changed. Lines 8313 set the pointers that cause ´ to be inserted. Like the other primitive operations on search trees, the procedure T REE-I NSERT runs in O.h/ time on a tree of height h. Deletion The overall strategy for deleting a node ´ from a binary search tree T has three basic cases and, as we’ll see, one of the cases is a bit tricky.  If ´ has no children, then simply remove it by modifying its parent to replace ´ with NIL as its child.  If ´ has just one child, then elevate that child to take ´’s position in the tree by modifying ´’s parent to replace ´ by ´’s child.  If ´ has two children, ûnd ´’s successor y 4which must belong to ´’s right subtree4and move y to take ´’s position in the tree. The rest of ´’s original right subtree becomes y ’s new right subtree, and ´’s left subtree becomes y ’s new left subtree. Because y is ´’s successor, it cannot have a left child, and y ’s original right child moves into y ’s original position, with the rest of y ’s original right subtree following automatically. This case is the tricky one because, as we’ll see, it matters whether y is ´’s right child. The procedure for deleting a given node ´ from a binary search tree T takes as arguments pointers to T and ´. It organizes its cases a bit differently from the three cases outlined previously by considering the four cases shown in Figure 12.4.  If ´ has no left child, then as in part (a) of the ûgure, replace ´ by its right child, which may or may not be NIL. When ´’s right child is NIL, this case deals with 12.3 Insertion and deletion 323 q q z (a) r q q z l (b) q z l (c) q y l y q z l (d) r q z l r y q l r y r l x x x y x x NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL Figure 12.4 Deleting a node ´, in blue, from a binary search tree. Node ´ may be the root, a left child of node q, or a right child of q. The node that will replace node ´ in its position in the tree is colored orange. (a) Node ´ has no left child. Replace ´ by its right child r , which may or may not be NIL. (b) Node ´ has a left child l but no right child. Replace ´ by l . (c) Node ´ has two children. Its left child is node l , its right child is its successor y (which has no left child), and y’s right child is node x. Replace ´ by y, updating y’s left child to become l , but leaving x as y’s right child. (d) Node ´ has two children (left child l and right child r ), and its successor y ¤ r lies within the subtree rooted at r . First replace y by its own right child x, and set y to be r ’s parent. Then set y to be q’s child and the parent of l . 324 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees the situation in which ´ has no children. When ´’s right child is non-NIL, this case handles the situation in which ´ has just one child, which is its right child.  Otherwise, if ´ has just one child, then that child is a left child. As in part (b) of the ûgure, replace ´ by its left child.  Otherwise, ´ has both a left and a right child. Find ´’s successor y , which lies in ´’s right subtree and has no left child (see Exercise 12.2-5). Splice node y out of its current location and replace ´ by y in the tree. How to do so depends on whether y is ´’s right child: B If y is ´’s right child, then as in part (c) of the ûgure, replace ´ by y , leaving y ’s right child alone. B Otherwise, y lies within ´’s right subtree but is not ´’s right child. In this case, as in part (d) of the ûgure, ûrst replace y by its own right child, and then replace ´ by y . As part of the process of deleting a node, subtrees need to move around within the binary search tree. The subroutine TRANSPLANT replaces one subtree as a child of its parent with another subtree. When TRANSPLANT replaces the sub- tree rooted at node u with the subtree rooted at node v, node u’s parent be- comes node v’s parent, and u’s parent ends up having v as its appropriate child. TRANSPLANT allows v to be NIL instead of a pointer to a node. TRANSPLANT .T; u; v/ 1 if u: p == NIL 2 T: root D v 3 elseif u == u: p: left 4 u: p: left D v 5 else u: p: right D v 6 if v ¤ NIL 7 v: p D u: p Here is how TRANSPLANT works. Lines 132 handle the case in which u is the root of T . Otherwise, u is either a left child or a right child of its parent. Lines 334 take care of updating u: p: left if u is a left child, and line 5 updates u: p: right if u is a right child. Because v may be NIL, lines 637 update v: p only if v is non-NIL. The procedure TRANSPLANT does not attempt to update v: left and v: right . Doing so, or not doing so, is the responsibility of TRANSPLANT’s caller. The procedure TREE-DELETE on the facing page uses TRANSPLANT to delete node ´ from binary search tree T . It executes the four cases as follows. Lines 132 handle the case in which node ´ has no left child (Figure 12.4(a)), and lines 334 12.3 Insertion and deletion 325 handle the case in which ´ has a left child but no right child (Figure 12.4(b)). Lines 5312 deal with the remaining two cases, in which ´ has two children. Line 5 ûnds node y , which is the successor of ´. Because ´ has a nonempty right subtree, its successor must be the node in that subtree with the smallest key; hence the call to TREE-MINIMUM.´: right /. As we noted before, y has no left child. The procedure needs to splice y out of its current location and replace ´ by y in the tree. If y is ´’s right child (Figure 12.4(c)), then lines 10312 replace ´ as a child of its parent by y and replace y ’s left child by ´’s left child. Node y retains its right child (x in Figure 12.4(c)), and so no change to y: right needs to occur. If y is not ´’s right child (Figure 12.4(d)), then two nodes have to move. Lines 739 replace y as a child of its parent by y ’s right child (x in Figure 12.4(c)) and make ´’s right child (r in the ûgure) become y ’s right child instead. Finally, lines 10312 replace ´ as a child of its parent by y and replace y ’s left child by ´’s left child. TREE-DELETE .T; ´/ 1 if ´: left == NIL 2 TRANSPLANT .T; ´; ´: right / // replace ´ by its right child 3 elseif ´: right == NIL 4 TRANSPLANT .T; ´; ´: left / // replace ´ by its left child 5 else y D TREE-MINIMUM.´: right / // y is ´’s successor 6 if y ¤ ´: right // is y farther down the tree? 7 TRANSPLANT .T; y; y: right / // replace y by its right child 8 y: right D ´: right // ´’s right child becomes 9 y: right : p D y // y ’s right child 10 TRANSPLANT .T; ´; y/ // replace ´ by its successor y 11 y: left D ´: left // and give ´’s left child to y, 12 y: left: p D y // which had no left child Each line of TREE-DELETE, including the calls to TRANSPLANT, takes constant time, except for the call to TREE-MINIMUM in line 5. Thus, TREE-DELETE runs in O.h/ time on a tree of height h. In summary, we have proved the following theorem. Theorem 12.3 The dynamic-set operations I NSERT and DELETE can be implemented so that each one runs in O.h/ time on a binary search tree of height h. 326 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees Exercises 12.3-1 Give a recursive version of the TREE-I NSERT procedure. 12.3-2 Suppose that you construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is 1 plus the number of nodes examined when the value was ûrst inserted into the tree. 12.3-3 You can sort a given set of n numbers by ûrst building a binary search tree contain- ing these numbers (using TREE-I NSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst- case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm? 12.3-4 When TREE-DELETE calls TRANSPLANT, under what circumstances can the pa- rameter v of TRANSPLANT be NIL? 12.3-5 Is the operation of deletion <commutative= in the sense that deleting x and then y from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting y and then x ? Argue why it is or give a counterexample. 12.3-6 Suppose that instead of each node x keeping the attribute x: p, pointing to x ’s parent, it keeps x: succ, pointing to x ’s successor. Give pseudocode for TREE- SEARCH, TREE-I NSERT, and TREE-DELETE on a binary search tree T using this representation. These procedures should operate in O.h/ time, where h is the height of the tree T . You may assume that all keys in the binary search tree are distinct. (Hint: You might wish to implement a subroutine that returns the parent of a node.) 12.3-7 When node ´ in TREE-DELETE has two children, you can choose node y to be its predecessor rather than its successor. What other changes to TREE-DELETE are necessary if you do so? Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might TREE-DELETE be minimally changed to implement such a fair strategy? Problems for Chapter 12 327 Problems 12-1 Binary search trees with equal keys Equal keys pose a problem for the implementation of binary search trees. a. What is the asymptotic performance of T REE-I NSERT when used to insert n items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree? Consider changing TREE-I NSERT to test whether ´: key D x: key before line 5 and to test whether ´: key D y: key before line 11. If equality holds, implement one of the following strategies. For each strategy, ûnd the asymptotic performance of inserting n items with identical keys into an initially empty binary search tree. (The strategies are described for line 5, which compares the keys of ´ and x . Substitute y for x to arrive at the strategies for line 11.) b. Keep a boolean üag x: b at node x , and set x to either x: left or x: right based on the value of x: b, which alternates between FALSE and TRUE each time TREE- I NSERT visits x while inserting a node with the same key as x . c. Keep a list of nodes with equal keys at x , and insert ´ into the list. d. Randomly set x to either x: left or x: right. (Give the worst-case performance and informally derive the expected running time.) 12-2 Radix trees Given two strings a D a 0 a 1 : : : a p and b D b 0 b 1 : : : b q , where each a i and each b j belongs to some ordered set of characters, we say that string a is lexicographically less than string b if either 1. there exists an integer j , where 0 හ j හ min fp; qg, such that a i D b i for all i D 0; 1; : : : ; j  1 and a j < b j , or 2. p < q and a i D b i for all i D 0; 1; : : : ; p. For example, if a and b are bit strings, then 10100 < 10110 by rule 1 (letting j D 3) and 10100 < 101000 by rule 2. This ordering is similar to that used in English-language dictionaries. The radix tree data structure shown in Figure 12.5 (also known as a trie) stores the bit strings 1011, 10, 011, 100, and 0. When searching for a key a D a 0 a 1 : : : a p , go left at a node of depth i if a i D 0 and right if a i D 1. Let S be a set of distinct bit strings whose lengths sum to n. Show how to use a radix tree to sort S lexicographically in ‚.n/ time. For the example in Figure 12.5, the output of the sort should be the sequence 0, 011, 10, 100, 1011. 328 Chapter 12 Binary Search Trees 011 0 100 10 1011 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 Figure 12.5 A radix tree storing the bit strings 1011, 10, 011, 100, and 0. To determine each node’s key, traverse the simple path from the root to that node. There is no need, therefore, to store the keys in the nodes. The keys appear here for illustrative purposes only. Keys corresponding to blue nodes are not in the tree. Such nodes are present only to establish a path to other nodes. 12-3 Average node depth in a randomly built binary search tree A randomly built binary search tree on n keys is a binary search tree created by starting with an empty tree and inserting the keys in random order, where each of the nŠ permutations of the keys is equally likely. In this problem, you will prove that the average depth of a node in a randomly built binary search tree with n nodes is O.lg n/. The technique reveals a surprising similarity between the building of a binary search tree and the execution of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT from Sec- tion 7.3. Denote the depth of any node x in tree T by d.x; T /. Then the total path length P .T / of a tree T is the sum, over all nodes x in T , of d.x; T /. a. Argue that the average depth of a node in T is 1 n X x2T d.x; T / D 1 n P .T / : Thus, you need to show that the expected value of P .T / is O.n lg n/. b. Let T L and T R denote the left and right subtrees of tree T , respectively. Argue that if T has n nodes, then P .T / D P .T L / C P .T R / C n  1 : c. Let P .n/ denote the average total path length of a randomly built binary search tree with n nodes. Show that Problems for Chapter 12 329 P .n/ D 1 n n1 X i D0 .P .i / C P .n  i  1/ C n  1/ : d.

Each recursive invocation of randomized quicksort chooses a random pivot element to partition the set of elements being sorted. Each node of a binary search tree partitions the set of elements that fall into the subtree rooted at that node. f. Describe an implementation of quicksort in which the comparisons to sort a set of elements are exactly the same as the comparisons to insert the elements into a binary search tree.

Show that n D 4 n p �n 3=2 .1 C O.1=n// : Chapter notes Knuth [261] contains a good discussion of simple binary search trees as well as many variations. Binary search trees seem to have been independently discovered by a number of people in the late 1950s. Radix trees are often called <tries,= which comes from the middle letters in the word retrieval. Knuth [261] also discusses them. Many texts, including the ûrst two editions of this book, describe a somewhat simpler method of deleting a node from a binary search tree when both of its chil- dren are present. Instead of replacing node ´ by its successor y , delete node y but copy its key and satellite data into node ´. The downside of this approach is that the node actually deleted might not be the node passed to the delete procedure. If other components of a program maintain pointers to nodes in the tree, they could mistakenly end up with <stale= pointers to nodes that have been deleted. Although the deletion method presented in this edition of this book is a bit more complicated, it guarantees that a call to delete node ´ deletes node ´ and only node ´. Section 14.5 will show how to construct an optimal binary search tree when you know the search frequencies before constructing the tree. That is, given the frequencies of searching for each key and the frequencies of searching for values that fall between keys in the tree, a set of searches in the constructed binary search tree examines the minimum number of nodes. 13 Red-Black Trees Chapter 12 showed that a binary search tree of height h can support any of the basic dynamic-set operations4such as S EARCH, PREDECESSOR, SUCCESSOR, MINI - MUM, MAXIMUM, I NSERT, and DELETE4in O.h/ time. Thus, the set operations are fast if the height of the search tree is small. If its height is large, however, the set operations may run no faster than with a linked list. Red-black trees are one of many search-tree schemes that are <balanced= in order to guarantee that basic dynamic-set operations take O.lg n/ time in the worst case. 13.1 Properties of red-black trees A red-black tree is a binary search tree with one extra bit of storage per node: its color, which can be either RED or BLAC K. By constraining the node colors on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no such path is more than twice as long as any other, so that the tree is approximately balanced. Indeed, as we’re about to see, the height of a red-black tree with n keys is at most 2 lg.n C 1/, which is O.lg n/. Each node of the tree now contains the attributes color , key, left , right , and p. If a child or the parent of a node does not exist, the corresponding pointer attribute of the node contains the value NIL. Think of these NILs as pointers to leaves (external nodes) of the binary search tree and the normal, key-bearing nodes as internal nodes of the tree. A red-black tree is a binary search tree that satisûes the following red-black properties: 1. Every node is either red or black. 2. The root is black. 3. Every leaf (NIL) is black. 332 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees 4. If a node is red, then both its children are black. 5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes. Figure 13.1(a) shows an example of a red-black tree. As a matter of convenience in dealing with boundary conditions in red-black tree code, we use a single sentinel to represent NIL (see page 262). For a red-black tree T , the sentinel T: nil is an object with the same attributes as an ordinary node in the tree. Its color attribute is BLAC K, and its other attributes4p, left , right , and key4can take on arbitrary values. As Figure 13.1(b) shows, all pointers to NIL are replaced by pointers to the sentinel T: nil. Why use the sentinel? The sentinel makes it possible to treat a NIL child of a node x as an ordinary node whose parent is x . An alternative design would use a distinct sentinel node for each NIL in the tree, so that the parent of each NIL is well deûned. That approach needlessly wastes space, however. Instead, just the one sentinel T: nil represents all the NILs4all leaves and the root’s parent. The values of the attributes p, left, right , and key of the sentinel are immaterial. The red-black tree procedures can place whatever values in the sentinel that yield simpler code. We generally conûne our interest to the internal nodes of a red-black tree, since they hold the key values. The remainder of this chapter omits the leaves in drawings of red-black trees, as shown in Figure 13.1(c). We call the number of black nodes on any simple path from, but not including, a node x down to a leaf the black-height of the node, denoted bh.x/. By property 5, the notion of black-height is well deûned, since all descending simple paths from the node have the same number of black nodes. The black-height of a red-black tree is the black-height of its root. The following lemma shows why red-black trees make good search trees. Lemma 13.1 A red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2 lg.n C 1/. Proof We start by showing that the subtree rooted at any node x contains at least 2 bh.x/  1 internal nodes. We prove this claim by induction on the height of x . If the height of x is 0, then x must be a leaf (T: nil), and the subtree rooted at x indeed contains at least 2 bh.x/  1 D 2 0  1 D 0 internal nodes. For the inductive step, consider a node x that has positive height and is an internal node. Then node x has two children, either or both of which may be a leaf. If a child is black, then it contributes 1 to x ’s black-height but not to its own. If a child is red, then it contributes to neither x ’s black-height nor its own. Therefore, each child has a black-height of either bh.x/  1 (if it’s black) or bh.x/ (if it’s red). Since the height of a child of x is less than the height of x itself, we can apply the inductive 13.1 Properties of red-black trees 333 NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL 26 41 47 30 28 38 35 39 17 21 23 19 20 14 16 15 10 12 7 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 (a) 26 41 47 30 28 38 35 39 17 21 23 19 20 14 16 15 10 12 7 3 (b) 26 41 47 30 28 38 35 39 17 21 23 19 20 14 16 15 10 12 7 3 (c) T: nil Figure 13.1 A red-black tree. Every node in a red-black tree is either red or black, the children of a red node are both black, and every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes. (a) Every leaf, shown as a NIL, is black. Each non-NIL node is marked with its black-height, where NILs have black-height 0. (b) The same red-black tree but with each NIL replaced by the single sentinel T: nil, which is always black, and with black-heights omitted. The root’s parent is also the sentinel. (c) The same red-black tree but with leaves and the root’s parent omitted entirely. The remainder of this chapter uses this drawing style. 334 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees hypothesis to conclude that each child has at least 2 bh.x/1  1 internal nodes. Thus, the subtree rooted at x contains at least .2 bh.x/1 1/ C.2 bh.x/1 1/ C1 D 2 bh.x/ 1 internal nodes, which proves the claim. To complete the proof of the lemma, let h be the height of the tree. According to property 4, at least half the nodes on any simple path from the root to a leaf, not including the root, must be black. Consequently, the black-height of the root must be at least h=2, and thus, n  2 h=2  1 : Moving the 1 to the left-hand side and taking logarithms on both sides yields lg.n C 1/  h=2, or h හ 2 lg.n C 1/. As an immediate consequence of this lemma, each of the dynamic-set opera- tions SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR runs in O.lg n/ time on a red-black tree, since each can run in O.h/ time on a bi- nary search tree of height h (as shown in Chapter 12) and any red-black tree on n nodes is a binary search tree with height O.lg n/. (Of course, references to NIL in the algorithms of Chapter 12 have to be replaced by T: nil.) Although the pro- cedures TREE-I NSERT and TREE-DELETE from Chapter 12 run in O.lg n/ time when given a red-black tree as input, you cannot just use them to implement the dynamic-set operations I NSERT and DELETE. They do not necessarily maintain the red-black properties, so you might not end up with a legal red-black tree. The remainder of this chapter shows how to insert into and delete from a red-black tree in O.lg n/ time.

Add the NIL leaves and color the nodes in three different ways such that the black-heights of the resulting red-black trees are 2, 3, and 4. 13.1-2 Draw the red-black tree that results after TREE-I NSERT is called on the tree in Figure 13.1 with key 36. If the inserted node is colored red, is the resulting tree a red-black tree? What if it is colored black? 13.1-3 Deûne a relaxed red-black tree as a binary search tree that satisûes red-black prop- erties 1, 3, 4, and 5, but whose root may be either red or black. Consider a relaxed red-black tree T whose root is red. If the root of T is changed to black but no other changes occur, is the resulting tree a red-black tree? 13.2 Rotations 335 13.1-4 Suppose that every black node in a red-black tree <absorbs= all of its red children, so that the children of any red node become children of the black parent. (Ignore what happens to the keys.) What are the possible degrees of a black node after all its red children are absorbed? What can you say about the depths of the leaves of the resulting tree? 13.1-5 Show that the longest simple path from a node x in a red-black tree to a descendant leaf has length at most twice that of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf. 13.1-6 What is the largest possible number of internal nodes in a red-black tree with black- height k? What is the smallest possible number? 13.1-7 Describe a red-black tree on n keys that realizes the largest possible ratio of red in- ternal nodes to black internal nodes. What is this ratio? What tree has the smallest possible ratio, and what is the ratio? 13.1-8 Argue that in a red-black tree, a red node cannot have exactly one non-NIL child. 13.2 Rotations The search-tree operations TREE-I NSERT and TREE-DELETE, when run on a red- black tree with n keys, take O.lg n/ time. Because they modify the tree, the result may violate the red-black properties enumerated in Section 13.1. To restore these properties, colors and pointers within nodes need to change. The pointer structure changes through rotation, which is a local operation in a search tree that preserves the binary-search-tree property. Figure 13.2 shows the two kinds of rotations: left rotations and right rotations. Let’s look at a left rotation on a node x , which transforms the structure on the right side of the ûgure to the structure on the left. Node x has a right child y , which must not be T: nil. The left rotation changes the subtree originally rooted at x by <twisting= the link between x and y to the left. The new root of the subtree is node y , with x as y ’s left child and y ’s original left child (the subtree represented by ˇ in the ûgure) as x ’s right child. The pseudocode for LEFT-ROTATE appearing on the following page assumes that x: right ¤ T: nil and that the root’s parent is T: nil.

How do the depths of a, b, and c change when a left rotation is performed on node x in the ûgure? 13.2-4 Show that any arbitrary n-node binary search tree can be transformed into any other arbitrary n-node binary search tree using O.n/ rotations. (Hint: First show that at most n  1 right rotations sufûce to transform the tree into a right-going chain.) ? 13.2-5 We say that a binary search tree T 1 can be right-converted to binary search tree T 2 if it is possible to obtain T 2 from T 1 via a series of calls to RIGHT-ROTATE. Give an example of two trees T 1 and T 2 such that T 1 cannot be right-converted to T 2 . Then, show that if a tree T 1 can be right-converted to T 2 , it can be right-converted using O.n 2 / calls to RIGHT-ROTATE. 338 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees 13.3 Insertion In order to insert a node into a red-black tree with n internal nodes in O.lg n/ time and maintain the red-black properties, we’ll need to slightly modify the TREE- I NSERT procedure on page 321. The procedure RB-I NSERT starts by inserting node ´ into the tree T as if it were an ordinary binary search tree, and then it col- ors ´ red. (Exercise 13.3-1 asks you to explain why to make node ´ red rather than black.) To guarantee that the red-black properties are preserved, an auxiliary procedure RB-I NSERT-FIXUP on the facing page recolors nodes and performs ro- tations. The call RB-I NSERT .T; ´/ inserts node ´, whose key is assumed to have already been ûlled in, into the red-black tree T . RB-I NSERT .T; ´/ 1 x D T: root // node being compared with ´ 2 y D T: nil // y will be parent of ´ 3 while x ¤ T: nil // descend until reaching the sentinel 4 y D x 5 if ´: key < x: key 6 x D x: left 7 else x D x: right 8 ´: p D y // found the location4insert ´ with parent y 9 if y == T: nil 10 T: root D ´ // tree T was empty 11 elseif ´: key < y: key 12 y: left D ´ 13 else y: right D ´ 14 ´: left D T: nil // both of ´’s children are the sentinel 15 ´: right D T: nil 16 ´: color D RED // the new node starts out red 17 RB-I NSERT-FIXUP .T; ´/ // correct any violations of red-black properties The procedures TREE-I NSERT and RB-I NSERT differ in four ways. First, all instances of NIL in TREE-I NSERT are replaced by T: nil. Second, lines 14315 of RB-I NSERT set ´: left and ´: right to T: nil, in order to maintain the proper tree structure. (TREE-I NSERT assumed that ´’s children were already NIL.) Third, line 16 colors ´ red. Fourth, because coloring ´ red may cause a violation of one of the red-black properties, line 17 of RB-I NSERT calls RB-I NSERT-FIXUP .T; ´/ in order to restore the red-black properties. 13.3 Insertion 339 RB-I NSERT-FIXUP .T; ´/ 1 while ´: p: color == RED 2 if ´: p == ´: p: p: left // is ´’s parent a left child? 3 y D ´: p: p: right // y is ´’s uncle 4 if y: color == RED // are ´’s parent and uncle both red? 5 ´: p: color D BLAC K * case 1 6 y: color D BLAC K 7 ´: p: p: color D RED 8 ´ D ´: p: p 9 else 10 if ´ == ´: p: right 11 ´ D ´: p ð case 2 12 LEFT-ROTATE .T; ´/ 13 ´: p: color D BLAC K ) case 3 14 ´: p: p: color D RED 15 RIGHT-ROTATE .T; ´: p: p/ 16 else // same as lines 3315, but with <right= and <left= exchanged 17 y D ´: p: p: left 18 if y: color == RED 19 ´: p: color D BLAC K 20 y: color D BLAC K 21 ´: p: p: color D RED 22 ´ D ´: p: p 23 else 24 if ´ == ´: p: left 25 ´ D ´: p 26 RIGHT-ROTATE .T; ´/ 27 ´: p: color D BLAC K 28 ´: p: p: color D RED 29 LEFT-ROTATE .T; ´: p: p/ 30 T: root : color D BLAC K To understand how RB-I NSERT-FIXUP works, let’s examine the code in three major steps. First, we’ll determine which violations of the red-black properties might arise in RB-I NSERT upon inserting node ´ and coloring it red. Second, we’ll consider the overall goal of the while loop in lines 1329. Finally, we’ll explore each of the three cases within the while loop’s body (case 2 falls through into case 3, so these two cases are not mutually exclusive) and see how they accomplish the goal. 340 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees In describing the structure of a red-black tree, we’ll often need to refer to the sibling of a node’s parent. We use the term uncle for such a node. 1 Figure 13.4 shows how RB-I NSERT-FIXUP operates on a sample red-black tree, with cases depending in part on the colors of a node, its parent, and its uncle. What violations of the red-black properties might occur upon the call to RB-I NSERT-FIXUP ? Property 1 certainly continues to hold (every node is either red or black), as does property 3 (every leaf is black), since both children of the newly inserted red node are the sentinel T: nil. Property 5, which says that the number of black nodes is the same on every simple path from a given node, is sat- isûed as well, because node ´ replaces the (black) sentinel, and node ´ is red with sentinel children. Thus, the only properties that might be violated are property 2, which requires the root to be black, and property 4, which says that a red node cannot have a red child. Both possible violations may arise because ´ is colored red. Property 2 is violated if ´ is the root, and property 4 is violated if ´’s parent is red. Figure 13.4(a) shows a violation of property 4 after the node ´ has been inserted. The while loop of lines 1329 has two symmetric possibilities: lines 3315 deal with the situation in which node ´’s parent ´: p is a left child of ´’s grandpar- ent ´: p: p, and lines 17329 apply when ´’s parent is a right child. Our proof will focus only on lines 3315, relying on the symmetry in lines 17329. We’ll show that the while loop maintains the following three-part invariant at the start of each iteration of the loop: a. Node ´ is red. b. If ´: p is the root, then ´: p is black. c. If the tree violates any of the red-black properties, then it violates at most one of them, and the violation is of either property 2 or property 4, but not both. If the tree violates property 2, it is because ´ is the root and is red. If the tree violates property 4, it is because both ´ and ´: p are red. Part (c), which deals with violations of red-black properties, is more central to showing that RB-I NSERT-FIXUP restores the red-black properties than parts (a) and (b), which we’ll use along the way to understand situations in the code. Be- cause we’ll be focusing on node ´ and nodes near it in the tree, it helps to know from part (a) that ´ is red. Part (b) will help show that ´’s grandparent ´: p: p exists when it’s referenced in lines 2, 3, 7, 8, 14, and 15 (recall that we’re focusing only on lines 3315). 1 Although we try to avoid gendered language in this book, the E nglish language lacks a gender- neutral word for a parent’s sibling. 13.3 Insertion 341 z y 11 2 1 7 5 4 8 14 15 z y 11 2 1 7 5 4 8 14 15 (a) (b) Case 1 z y 11 7 2 8 4 14 15 (c) Case 2 1 5 4 z 7 2 1 5 11 14 (d) Case 3 4 8 15 Figure 13.4 The operation of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. (a) A node ´ after insertion. Because both ´ and its parent ´: p are red, a violation of property 4 occurs. Since ´’s uncle y is red, case 1 in the code applies. Node ´’s grandparent ´: p: p must be black, and its blackness transfers down one level to ´’s parent and uncle. Once the pointer ´ moves up two levels in the tree, the tree shown in (b) results. Once again, ´ and its parent are both red, but this time ´’s uncle y is black. Since ´ is the right child of ´: p, case 2 applies. Performing a left rotation results in the tree in (c). Now ´ is the left child of its parent, and case 3 applies. Recoloring and right rotat ion yield the tree in (d), which is a legal red-black tree. 342 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees Recall that to use a loop invariant, we need to show that the invariant is true upon entering the ûrst iteration of the loop, that each iteration maintains it, that the loop terminates, and that the loop invariant gives us a useful property at loop termination. We’ll see that each iteration of the loop has two possible outcomes: either the pointer ´ moves up the tree, or some rotations occur and then the loop terminates. Initialization: Before RB-I NSERT is called, the red-black tree has no violations. RB-I NSERT adds a red node ´ and calls RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. We’ll show that each part of the invariant holds at the time RB-I NSERT-FIXUP is called: a. When RB-I NSERT-FIXUP is called, ´ is the red node that was added. b. If ´: p is the root, then ´: p started out black and did not change before the call of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. c. We have already seen that properties 1, 3, and 5 hold when RB-I NSERT- FIXUP is called. If the tree violates property 2 (the root must be black), then the red root must be the newly added node ´, which is the only internal node in the tree. Because the parent and both children of ´ are the sentinel, which is black, the tree does not also violate property 4 (both children of a red node are black). Thus this violation of property 2 is the only violation of red-black properties in the entire tree. If the tree violates property 4, then, because the children of node ´ are black sentinels and the tree had no other violations prior to ´ being added, the violation must be because both ´ and ´: p are red. Moreover, the tree violates no other red-black properties. Maintenance: There are six cases within the while loop, but we’ll examine only the three cases in lines 3315, when node ´’s parent ´: p is a left child of ´’s grandparent ´: p: p. The proof for lines 17329 is symmetric. The node ´: p: p exists, since by part (b) of the loop invariant, if ´: p is the root, then ´: p is black. Since RB-I NSERT-FIXUP enters a loop iteration only if ´: p is red, we know that ´: p cannot be the root. Hence, ´: p: p exists. Case 1 differs from cases 2 and 3 by the color of ´’s uncle y . Line 3 makes y point to ´’s uncle ´: p: p: right , and line 4 tests y ’s color. If y is red, then case 1 executes. Otherwise, control passes to cases 2 and 3. In all three cases, ´’s grandparent ´: p: p is black, since its parent ´: p is red, and property 4 is violated only between ´ and ´: p. 13.3 Insertion 343 z y C D A B ³ ´ µ ¶ ε (a) C D A B ³ ´ µ ¶ ε new z y C D B ¶ ε C D B A ³ ´ µ ¶ ε new z (b) A ³ ´ µ z Figure 13.5 Case 1 of the procedure RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. Both ´ and its parent ´: p are red, violat- ing property 4. In case 1, ´’s uncle y is red. The same action occurs regardless of whether (a) ´ is a right child or (b) ´ is a left child. Each of the subtrees ˛, ˇ, � , ı, and \" has a black root4possibly the sentinel4and each has the same black-height. The code for case 1 moves the blackness of ´’s grandparent down to ´’s parent and uncle, preserving property 5: all downward simple paths from a node to a leaf have the same number of blacks. The while loop continues with node ´’s grandpar- ent ´: p: p as the new ´. If the action of case 1 causes a new violation of property 4 to occur, it must be only between the new ´, which is red, and its parent, if it is red as well. Case 1: ´’s uncle y is red Figure 13.5 shows the situation for case 1 (lines 538), which occurs when both ´: p and y are red. Because ´’s grandparent ´: p: p is black, its blackness can transfer down one level to both ´: p and y , thereby ûxing the problem of ´ and ´: p both being red. Having had its blackness transferred down one level, ´’s grandparent becomes red, thereby maintaining property 5. The while loop repeats with ´: p: p as the new node ´, so that the pointer ´ moves up two levels in the tree. Now, we show that case 1 maintains the loop invariant at the start of the next iteration. We use ´ to denote node ´ in the current iteration, and ´ 0 D ´: p: p to denote the node that will be called node ´ at the test in line 1 upon the next iteration. a. Because this iteration colors ´: p: p red, node ´ 0 is red at the start of the next iteration. b. The node ´ 0 : p is ´: p: p: p in this iteration, and the color of this node does not change. If this node is the root, it was black prior to this iteration, and it remains black at the start of the next iteration. 344 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees C A B ³ ´ µ ¶ Case 2 z y B A ³ ´ µ ¶ Case 3 z y z A B C ³ ´ µ ¶ C Figure 13.6 Cases 2 and 3 of the procedure RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. As in case 1, property 4 is violated in either case 2 or case 3 because ´ and its parent ´: p are both red. Each of the subtrees ˛, ˇ, � , and ı has a black root (˛, ˇ, and � from property 4, and ı because otherwise case 1 would apply), and each has the same black-height. Case 2 transforms into case 3 by a left rotation, which preserves property 5: all downward simple paths from a node to a leaf have the same number of blacks. Case 3 causes some color changes and a right rotation, which also preserve property 5. The while loop then terminates, because property 4 is satisûed: there are no longer two red nodes in a row. c. We have already argued that case 1 maintains property 5, and it does not introduce a violation of properties 1 or 3. If node ´ 0 is the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 corrected the lone violation of property 4 in this iteration. Since ´ 0 is red and it is the root, property 2 becomes the only one that is violated, and this violation is due to ´ 0 . If node ´ 0 is not the root at the start of the next iteration, then case 1 has not created a violation of property 2. Case 1 corrected the lone violation of property 4 that existed at the start of this iteration. It then made ´ 0 red and left ´ 0 : p alone. If ´ 0 : p was black, there is no violation of property 4. If ´ 0 : p was red, coloring ´ 0 red created one violation of property 4, between ´ 0 and ´ 0 : p. Case 2: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a right child Case 3: ´’s uncle y is black and ´ is a left child In cases 2 and 3, the color of ´’s uncle y is black. We distinguish the two cases, which assume that ´’s parent ´: p is red and a left child, according to whether ´ is a right or left child of ´: p. Lines 11312 constitute case 2, which is shown in Figure 13.6 together with case 3. In case 2, node ´ is a right child of its parent. A left rotation immediately transforms the situation into case 3 (lines 13315), in which node ´ is a left child. Because both ´ and ´: p are red, the rotation affects neither the black-heights of nodes nor property 5. Whether case 3 executes directly or through case 2, ´’s uncle y is black, since otherwise case 1 would have run. Additionally, the node ´: p: p exists, since we have argued that this 13.3 Insertion 345 node existed at the time that lines 2 and 3 were executed, and after moving ´ up one level in line 11 and then down one level in line 12, the identity of ´: p: p remains unchanged. Case 3 performs some color changes and a right rotation, which preserve property 5. At this point, there are no longer two red nodes in a row. The while loop terminates upon the next test in line 1, since ´: p is now black. We now show that cases 2 and 3 maintain the loop invariant. (As we have just argued, ´: p will be black upon the next test in line 1, and the loop body will not execute again.) a. Case 2 makes ´ point to ´: p, which is red. No further change to ´ or its color occurs in cases 2 and 3. b. Case 3 makes ´: p black, so that if ´: p is the root at the start of the next iteration, it is black. c. As in case 1, properties 1, 3, and 5 are maintained in cases 2 and 3. Since node ´ is not the root in cases 2 and 3, we know that there is no viola- tion of property 2. Cases 2 and 3 do not introduce a violation of property 2, since the only node that is made red becomes a child of a black node by the rotation in case 3. Cases 2 and 3 correct the lone violation of property 4, and they do not intro- duce another violation. Termination: To see that the loop terminates, observe that if only case 1 occurs, then the node pointer ´ moves toward the root in each iteration, so that eventu- ally ´: p is black. (If ´ is the root, then ´: p is the sentinel T: nil, which is black.) If either case 2 or case 3 occurs, then we’ve seen that the loop terminates. Since the loop terminates because ´: p is black, the tree does not violate property 4 at loop termination. By the loop invariant, the only property that might fail to hold is property 2. Line 30 restores this property by coloring the root black, so that when RB-I NSERT-FIXUP terminates, all the red-black properties hold. Thus, we have shown that RB-I NSERT-FIXUP correctly restores the red-black properties. Analysis What is the running time of RB-I NSERT? Since the height of a red-black tree on n nodes is O.lg n/, lines 1316 of RB-I NSERT take O.lg n/ time. In RB-I NSERT- FIXUP, the while loop repeats only if case 1 occurs, and then the pointer ´ moves two levels up the tree. The total number of times the while loop can be executed is therefore O.lg n/. Thus, RB-I NSERT takes a total of O.lg n/ time. Moreover, it 346 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees never performs more than two rotations, since the while loop terminates if case 2 or case 3 is executed. Exercises 13.3-1 Line 16 of RB-I NSERT sets the color of the newly inserted node ´ to red. If in- stead ´’s color were set to black, then property 4 of a red-black tree would not be violated. Why not set ´’s color to black? 13.3-2 Show the red-black trees that result after successively inserting the keys 41; 38; 31; 12; 19; 8 into an initially empty red-black tree. 13.3-3 Suppose that the black-height of each of the subtrees ˛; ˇ; �; ı; \" in Figures 13.5 and 13.6 is k. Label each node in each ûgure with its black-height to verify that the indicated transformation preserves property 5. 13.3-4 Professor Teach is concerned that RB-I NSERT-FIXUP might set T: nil: color to RED, in which case the test in line 1 would not cause the loop to terminate when ´ is the root. Show that the professor’s concern is unfounded by arguing that RB- I NSERT-FIXUP never sets T: nil: color to RED. 13.3-5 Consider a red-black tree formed by inserting n nodes with RB-I NSERT. Argue that if n > 1, the tree has at least one red node. 13.3-6 Suggest how to implement RB-I NSERT efûciently if the representation for red- black trees includes no storage for parent pointers. 13.4 Deletion Like the other basic operations on an n-node red-black tree, deletion of a node takes O.lg n/ time. Deleting a node from a red-black tree is more complicated than inserting a node. The procedure for deleting a node from a red-black tree is based on the TREE- DELETE procedure on page 325. First, we need to customize the T RANSPLANT 13.4 Deletion 347 subroutine on page 324 that TREE-DELETE calls so that it applies to a red-black tree. Like TRANSPLANT, the new procedure RB-TRANSPLANT replaces the sub- tree rooted at node u by the subtree rooted at node v. The RB-TRANSPLANT pro- cedure differs from TRANSPLANT in two ways. First, line 1 references the sentinel T: nil instead of NIL. Second, the assignment to v: p in line 6 occurs uncondition- ally: the procedure can assign to v: p even if v points to the sentinel. We’ll take advantage of the ability to assign to v: p when v D T: nil. RB-TRANSPLANT .T; u; v/ 1 if u: p == T: nil 2 T: root D v 3 elseif u == u: p: left 4 u: p: left D v 5 else u: p: right D v 6 v: p D u: p The procedure RB-DELETE on the next page is like the TREE-DELETE proce- dure, but with additional lines of pseudocode. The additional lines deal with nodes x and y that may be involved in violations of the red-black properties. When the node ´ being deleted has at most one child, then y will be ´. When ´ has two children, then, as in TREE-DELETE, y will be ´’s successor, which has no left child and moves into ´’s position in the tree. Additionally, y takes on ´’s color. In either case, node y has at most one child: node x , which takes y ’s place in the tree. (Node x will be the sentinel T: nil if y has no children.) Since node y will be either removed from the tree or moved within the tree, the procedure needs to keep track of y ’s original color. If the red-black properties might be violated after deleting node ´, RB-DELETE calls the auxiliary procedure RB-DELETE-FIXUP, which changes colors and performs rotations to restore the red-black properties. Although RB-DELETE contains almost twice as many lines of pseudocode as TREE-DELETE, the two procedures have the same basic structure. You can ûnd each line of TREE-DELETE within RB-DELETE (with the changes of replacing NIL by T: nil and replacing calls to TRANSPLANT by calls to RB-TRANSPLANT), executed under the same conditions. In detail, here are the other differences between the two procedures:  Lines 1 and 9 set node y as described above: line 1 when node ´ has at most one child and line 9 when ´ has two children.  Because node y ’s color might change, the variable y-original-color stores y ’s color before any changes occur. Lines 2 and 10 set this variable immediately after assignments to y . When node ´ has two children, then nodes y and ´ are 348 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees RB-DELETE .T; ´/ 1 y D ´ 2 y-original-color D y: color 3 if ´: left == T: nil 4 x D ´: right 5 RB-TRANSPLANT .T; ´; ´: right / // replace ´ by its right child 6 elseif ´: right == T: nil 7 x D ´: left 8 RB-TRANSPLANT .T; ´; ´: left / // replace ´ by its left child 9 else y D TREE-MINIMUM.´: right / // y is ´’s successor 10 y-original-color D y: color 11 x D y: right 12 if y ¤ ´: right // is y farther down the tree? 13 RB-TRANSPLANT .T; y; y: right / // replace y by its right child 14 y: right D ´: right // ´’s right child becomes 15 y: right : p D y // y ’s right child 16 else x: p D y // in case x is T: nil 17 RB-TRANSPLANT .T; ´; y/ // replace ´ by its successor y 18 y: left D ´: left // and give ´’s left child to y , 19 y: left: p D y // which had no left child 20 y: color D ´: color 21 if y-original-color == BLAC K // if any red-black violations occurred, 22 RB-DELETE-FIXUP .T; x/ // correct them distinct. In this case, line 17 moves y into ´’s original position in the tree (that is, ´’s location in the tree at the time RB-DELETE was called), and line 20 gives y the same color as ´. When node y was originally black, removing or moving it could cause violations of the red-black properties, which are corrected by the call of RB-DELETE-FIXUP in line 22.  As discussed, the procedure keeps track of the node x that moves into node y ’s original position at the time of call. The assignments in lines 4, 7, and 11 set x to point to either y ’s only child or, if y has no children, the sentinel T: nil.  Since node x moves into node y ’s original position, the attribute x: p must be set correctly. If node ´ has two children and y is ´’s right child, then y just moves into ´’s position, with x remaining a child of y . Line 12 checks for this case. Although you might think that setting x: p to y in line 16 is unnecessary since x is a child of y , the call of RB-DELETE-FIXUP relies on x: p being y even if x is T: nil. Thus, when ´ has two children and y is ´’s right child, executing 13.4 Deletion 349 line 16 is necessary if y ’s right child is T: nil, and otherwise it does not change anything. Otherwise, node ´ is either the same as node y or it is a proper ancestor of y ’s original parent. In these cases, the calls of RB-TRANSPLANT in lines 5, 8, and 13 set x: p correctly in line 6 of RB-TRANSPLANT. (In these calls of RB-TRANSPLANT, the third parameter passed is the same as x .)  Finally, if node y was black, one or more violations of the red-black properties might arise. The call of RB-DELETE-FIXUP in line 22 restores the red-black properties. If y was red, the red-black properties still hold when y is removed or moved, for the following reasons: 1. No black-heights in the tree have changed. (See Exercise 13.4-1.) 2. No red nodes have been made adjacent. If ´ has at most one child, then y and ´ are the same node. That node is removed, with a child taking its place. If the removed node was red, then neither its parent nor its children can also be red, so moving a child to take its place cannot cause two red nodes to become adjacent. If, on the other hand, ´ has two children, then y takes ´’s place in the tree, along with ´’s color, so there cannot be two adjacent red nodes at y ’s new position in the tree. In addition, if y was not ´’s right child, then y ’s original right child x replaces y in the tree. Since y is red, x must be black, and so replacing y by x cannot cause two red nodes to become adjacent. 3. Because y could not have been the root if it was red, the root remains black. If node y was black, three problems may arise, which the call of RB-D ELETE- FIXUP will remedy. First, if y was the root and a red child of y became the new root, property 2 is violated. Second, if both x and its new parent are red, then a violation of property 4 occurs. Third, moving y within the tree causes any simple path that previously contained y to have one less black node. Thus, property 5 is now violated by any ancestor of y in the tree. We can correct the violation of prop- erty 5 by saying that when the black node y is removed or moved, its blackness transfers to the node x that moves into y ’s original position, giving x an <extra= black. That is, if we add 1 to the count of black nodes on any simple path that con- tains x , then under this interpretation, property 5 holds. But now another problem emerges: node x is neither red nor black, thereby violating property 1. Instead, node x is either <doubly black= or <red-and-black,= and it contributes either 2 or 1, respectively, to the count of black nodes on simple paths containing x . The color attribute of x will still be either RED (if x is red-and-black) or BLAC K (if x is dou- bly black). In other words, the extra black on a node is reüected in x ’s pointing to the node rather than in the color attribute. 350 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees The procedure RB-DELETE-FIXUP on the next page restores properties 1, 2, and 4. Exercises 13.4-2 and 13.4-3 ask you to show that the procedure restores properties 2 and 4, and so in the remainder of this section, we focus on property 1. The goal of the while loop in lines 1343 is to move the extra black up the tree until 1. x points to a red-and-black node, in which case line 44 colors x (singly) black; 2. x points to the root, in which case the extra black simply vanishes; or 3. having performed suitable rotations and recolorings, the loop exits. Like RB-I NSERT-FIXUP, the RB-DELETE-FIXUP procedure handles two sym- metric situations: lines 3322 for when node x is a left child, and lines 24343 for when x is a right child. Our proof focuses on the four cases shown in lines 3322. Within the while loop, x always points to a nonroot doubly black node. Line 2 determines whether x is a left child or a right child of its parent x: p so that either lines 3322 or 24343 will execute in a given iteration. The sibling of x is always denoted by a pointer w. Since node x is doubly black, node w cannot be T: nil, because otherwise, the number of blacks on the simple path from x: p to the (singly black) leaf w would be smaller than the number on the simple path from x: p to x . Recall that the RB-DELETE procedure always assigns to x: p before calling RB- DELETE-FIXUP (either within the call of RB-TRANSPLANT in line 13 or the as- signment in line 16), even when node x is the sentinel T: nil. That is because RB-DELETE-FIXUP references x ’s parent x: p in several places, and this attribute must point to the node that became x ’s parent in RB-DELETE4even if x is T: nil. Figure 13.7 demonstrates the four cases in the code when node x is a left child. (As in RB-I NSERT-FIXUP, the cases in RB-DELETE-FIXUP are not mutually ex- clusive.) Before examining each case in detail, let’s look more generally at how we can verify that the transformation in each of the cases preserves property 5. The key idea is that in each case, the transformation applied preserves the num- ber of black nodes (including x ’s extra black) from (and including) the root of the subtree shown to the roots of each of the subtrees ˛; ˇ; : : : ; � . Thus, if property 5 holds prior to the transformation, it continues to hold afterward. For example, in Figure 13.7(a), which illustrates case 1, the number of black nodes from the root to the root of either subtree ˛ or ˇ is 3, both before and after the transformation. (Again, remember that node x adds an extra black.) Similarly, the number of black nodes from the root to the root of any of � , ı , \", and � is 2, both before and after the transformation. 2 In Figure 13.7(b), the counting must involve the value c of the color attribute of the root of the subtree shown, which can be either RED or BLAC K. 2 If property 5 holds, we can assume that paths from the roots of � , ı, \", and � down to leaves contain one more black than do paths from the roots of ˛ and ˇ down to leaves. 13.4 Deletion 351 RB-DELETE-FIXUP .T; x/ 1 while x ¤ T: root and x: color == BLAC K 2 if x == x: p: left // is x a left child? 3 w D x: p: right // w is x’s sibling 4 if w: color == RED 5 w: color D BLAC K * case 1 6 x: p: color D RED 7 LEFT-ROTATE .T; x: p/ 8 w D x: p: right 9 if w: left: color == BLAC K and w: right: color == BLAC K 10 w: color D RED ð case 2 11 x D x: p 12 else 13 if w: right: color == BLAC K 14 w: left: color D BLAC K * case 3 15 w: color D RED 16 RIGHT-ROTATE .T; w/ 17 w D x: p: right 18 w: color D x: p: color … case 4 19 x: p: color D BLAC K 20 w: right: color D BLAC K 21 LEFT-ROTATE .T; x: p/ 22 x D T: root 23 else // same as lines 3322, but with <right= and <left= exchanged 24 w D x: p: left 25 if w: color == RED 26 w: color D BLAC K 27 x: p: color D RED 28 RIGHT-ROTATE .T; x: p/ 29 w D x: p: left 30 if w: right: color == BLAC K and w: left: color == BLAC K 31 w: color D RED 32 x D x: p 33 else 34 if w: left: color == BLAC K 35 w: right: color D BLAC K 36 w: color D RED 37 LEFT-ROTATE .T; w/ 38 w D x: p: left 39 w: color D x: p: color 40 x: p: color D BLAC K 41 w: left: color D BLAC K 42 RIGHT-ROTATE .T; x: p/ 43 x D T: root 44 x: color D BLAC K 352 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees A B D C E ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ x w A B C D E x new w ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ A B D C E ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ x w c A B D C E ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ c new x A B D C E ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ x w c A B C D ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ x c new w A B D C E ³ ´ µ ¶ ε ζ x w c c ³ ´ A B C D E (d) (c) (b) (a) µ ¶ ε ζ Case 4 Case 3 Case 2 Case 1 E cʹ cʹ new x D T: root Figure 13.7 The cases in lines 3322 of the procedure RB-D ELETE-FIXUP. Brown nodes have color attributes represented by c and c 0 , which may be either RED or BLAC K. The letters ˛; ˇ; : : : ; � represent arbitrary subtrees. Each case transforms the conûguration on the left into the conûguration on the right by changing some colors and/or performing a rotation. Any node pointed to by x has an extra black and is either doubly black or red-and-black. Only case 2 causes the loop to repeat. (a) Case 1 is transformed into case 2, 3, or 4 by exchanging the colors of nodes B and D and performing a left rotation. (b) In case 2, the extra black represented by the pointer x moves up the tree by coloring node D red and setting x to point to node B. If case 2 is entered through case 1, the while loop terminates because the new node x is red-and-black, and therefore the value c of its color attribute is RED. (c) Case 3 is transformed to case 4 by exchanging the colors of nodes C and D and performing a right rotation. (d) Case 4 removes the extra black represented by x by changing some colors and performing a left rotation (without violating th e red-black properties), and then the loop terminates. 13.4 Deletion 353 If we deûne count.RED/ D 0 and count.BLAC K/ D 1, then the number of black nodes from the root to ˛ is 2 C count.c/, both before and after the transformation. In this case, after the transformation, the new node x has color attribute c , but this node is really either red-and-black (if c D RED) or doubly black (if c D BLAC K). You can verify the other cases similarly (see Exercise 13.4-6). Case 1: x’s sibling w is red Case 1 (lines 538 and Figure 13.7(a)) occurs when node w, the sibling of node x , is red. Because w is red, it must have black children. This case switches the colors of w and x: p and then performs a left-rotation on x: p without violating any of the red-black properties. The new sibling of x , which is one of w’s children prior to the rotation, is now black, and thus case 1 converts into one of cases 2, 3, or 4. Cases 2, 3, and 4 occur when node w is black and are distinguished by the colors of w’s children. Case 2: x’s sibling w is black, and both of w’s children are black In case 2 (lines 10311 and Figure 13.7(b)), both of w’s children are black. Since w is also black, this case removes one black from both x and w, leaving x with only one black and leaving w red. To compensate for x and w each losing one black, x ’s parent x: p can take on an extra black. Line 11 does so by moving x up one level, so that the while loop repeats with x: p as the new node x . If case 2 enters through case 1, the new node x is red-and-black, since the original x: p was red. Hence, the value c of the color attribute of the new node x is RED, and the loop terminates when it tests the loop condition. Line 44 then colors the new node x (singly) black. Case 3: x’s sibling w is black, w’s left child is red, and w’s right child is black Case 3 (lines 14317 and Figure 13.7(c)) occurs when w is black, its left child is red, and its right child is black. This case switches the colors of w and its left child w: left and then performs a right rotation on w without violating any of the red-black properties. The new sibling w of x is now a black node with a red right child, and thus case 3 falls through into case 4. Case 4: x’s sibling w is black, and w’s right child is red Case 4 (lines 18322 and Figure 13.7(d)) occurs when node x ’s sibling w is black and w’s right child is red. Some color changes and a left rotation on x: p allow the extra black on x to vanish, making it singly black, without violating any of the red-black properties. Line 22 sets x to be the root, and the while loop terminates when it next tests the loop condition. 354 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees Analysis What is the running time of RB-DELETE? Since the height of a red-black tree of n nodes is O.lg n/, the total cost of the procedure without the call to RB-DELETE- FIXUP takes O.lg n/ time. Within RB-DELETE-FIXUP, each of cases 1, 3, and 4 lead to termination after performing a constant number of color changes and at most three rotations. Case 2 is the only case in which the while loop can be re- peated, and then the pointer x moves up the tree at most O.lg n/ times, performing no rotations. Thus, the procedure RB-DELETE-FIXUP takes O.lg n/ time and per- forms at most three rotations, and the overall time for RB-DELETE is therefore also O.lg n/. Exercises 13.4-1 Show that if node y in RB-DELETE is red, then no black-heights change. 13.4-2 Argue that after RB-DELETE-FIXUP executes, the root of the tree must be black. 13.4-3 Argue that if in RB-DELETE both x and x: p are red, then property 4 is restored by the call to RB-DELETE-FIXUP .T; x/. 13.4-4 In Exercise 13.3-2 on page 346, you found the red-black tree that results from suc- cessively inserting the keys 41; 38; 31; 12; 19; 8 into an initially empty tree. Now show the red-black trees that result from the successive deletion of the keys in the order 8; 12; 19; 31; 38; 41. 13.4-5 Which lines of the code for RB-DELETE-FIXUP might examine or modify the sentinel T: nil? 13.4-6 In each of the cases of Figure 13.7, give the count of black nodes from the root of the subtree shown to the roots of each of the subtrees ˛; ˇ; : : : ; � , and verify that each count remains the same after the transformation. When a node has a color attribute c or c 0 , use the notation count.c/ or count.c 0 / symbolically in your count. 13.4-7 Professors Skelton and Baron worry that at the start of case 1 of RB-D ELETE- FIXUP, the node x: p might not be black. If x: p is not black, then lines 536 are Problems for Chapter 13 355 wrong. Show that x: p must be black at the start of case 1, so that the professors need not be concerned. 13.4-8 A node x is inserted into a red-black tree with RB-I NSERT and then is immediately deleted with RB-DELETE. Is the resulting red-black tree always the same as the initial red-black tree? Justify your answer. ? 13.4-9 Consider the operation RB-ENUMERATE .T; r; a; b/, which outputs all the keys k such that a හ k හ b in a subtree rooted at node r in an n-node red-black tree T . Describe how to implement RB-ENUMERATE in ‚.m C lg n/ time, where m is the number of keys that are output. Assume that the keys in T are unique and that the values a and b appear as keys in T . How does your solution change if a and b might not appear in T ? Problems 13-1 Persistent dynamic sets During the course of an algorithm, you sometimes ûnd that you need to maintain past versions of a dynamic set as it is updated. We call such a set persistent. One way to implement a persistent set is to copy the entire set whenever it is modi- ûed, but this approach can slow down a program and also consume a lot of space. Sometimes, you can do much better. Consider a persistent set S with the operations I NSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH, which you implement using binary search trees as shown in Figure 13.8(a). Main- tain a separate root for every version of the set. In order to insert the key 5 into the set, create a new node with key 5. This node becomes the left child of a new node with key 7, since you cannot modify the existing node with key 7. Similarly, the new node with key 7 becomes the left child of a new node with key 8 whose right child is the existing node with key 10. The new node with key 8 becomes, in turn, the right child of a new root r 0 with key 4 whose left child is the existing node with key 3. Thus, you copy only part of the tree and share some of the nodes with the original tree, as shown in Figure 13.8(b). Assume that each tree node has the attributes key, left , and right but no parent. (See also Exercise 13.3-6 on page 346.) a. For a persistent binary search tree (not a red-black tree, just a binary search tree), identify the nodes that need to change to insert or delete a node. 356 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees 4 3 2 8 7 10 4 8 7 5 (b) r rʹ 4 3 2 8 7 10 (a) r Figure 13.8 (a) A binary search tree with keys 2; 3; 4; 7; 8; 10.

Show how to use red-black trees to guarantee that the worst-case running time and space are O.lg n/ per insertion or deletion. You may assume that all keys are distinct. 13-2 Join operation on red-black trees The join operation takes two dynamic sets S 1 and S 2 and an element x such that for any x 1 2 S 1 and x 2 2 S 2 , we have x 1 : key හ x: key හ x 2 : key. It returns a set S D S 1 [ fx g [ S 2 . In this problem, we investigate how to implement the join operation on red-black trees. a. Suppose that you store the black-height of a red-black tree T as the new at- tribute T: bh. Argue that RB-I NSERT and RB-DELETE can maintain the bh Problems for Chapter 13 357 attribute without requiring extra storage in the nodes of the tree and without increasing the asymptotic running times. Show how to determine the black- height of each node visited while descending through T , using O.1/ time per node visited. Let T 1 and T 2 be red-black trees and x be a key value such that for any nodes x 1 in T 1 and x 2 in T 2 , we have x 1 : key හ x: key හ x 2 : key. You will show how to implement the operation RB-J OIN.T 1 ; x; T 2 /, which destroys T 1 and T 2 and returns a red-black tree T D T 1 [ fx g [ T 2 .

To implement an AVL tree, maintain an extra attribute h in each node such that x: h is the height of node x . As for any other binary search tree T , assume that T: root points to the root node. a. Prove that an AVL tree with n nodes has height O.lg n/. (Hint: Prove that an AVL tree of height h has at least F h nodes, where F h is the hth Fibonacci number.) b. To insert into an AVL tree, ûrst place a node into the appropriate place in bi- nary search tree order. Afterward, the tree might no longer be height balanced. Speciûcally, the heights of the left and right children of some node might differ by 2. Describe a procedure BALANCE.x/, which takes a subtree rooted at x whose left and right children are height balanced and have heights that differ 358 Chapter 13 Red-Black Trees by at most 2, so that jx: right : h  x: left: hj හ 2, and alters the subtree rooted at x to be height balanced. The procedure should return a pointer to the node that is the root of the subtree after alterations occur. (Hint: Use rotations.) c. Using part (b), describe a recursive procedure AVL-I NSERT .T; ´/ that takes an AVL tree T and a newly created node ´ (whose key has already been ûlled in), and adds ´ into T , maintaining the property that T is an AVL tree. As in TREE-I NSERT from Section 12.3, assume that ´: key has already been ûlled in and that ´: left D NIL and ´: right D NIL. Assume as well that ´: h D 0. d. Show that AVL-I NSERT, run on an n-node AVL tree, takes O.lg n/ time and performs O.lg n/ rotations. Chapter notes The idea of balancing a search tree is due to Adel’son-Vel’ski˘ ı and Landis [2], who introduced a class of balanced search trees called <AVL trees= in 1962, described in Problem 13-3. Another class of search trees, called <2-3 trees,= was introduced by J. E. Hopcroft (unpublished) in 1970. A 2-3 tree maintains balance by manipulating the degrees of nodes in the tree, where each node has either two or three children. Chapter 18 covers a generalization of 2-3 trees introduced by Bayer and McCreight [39], called <B-trees.= Red-black trees were invented by Bayer [38] under the name <symmetric binary B-trees.= Guibas and Sedgewick [202] studied their properties at length and in- troduced the red/black color convention. Andersson [16] gives a simpler-to-code variant of red-black trees. Weiss [451] calls this variant AA-trees. An AA-tree is similar to a red-black tree except that left children can never be red. Sedgewick and Wayne [402] present red-black trees as a modiûed version of 2-3 trees in which a node with three children is split into two nodes with two children each. One of these nodes becomes the left child of the other, and only left children can be red. They call this structure a <left-leaning red-black binary search tree.= Although the code for left-leaning red-black binary search trees is more concise than the red-black tree pseudocode in this chapter, operations on left-leaning red- black binary search trees do not limit the number of rotations per operation to a constant. This distinction will matter in Chapter 17. Treaps, a hybrid of binary search trees and heaps, were proposed by Seidel and Aragon [404]. They are the default implementation of a dictionary in LEDA [324], which is a well-implemented collection of data structures and algorithms. There are many other variations on balanced binary trees, including weight- balanced trees [344], k-neighbor trees [318], and scapegoat trees [174]. Perhaps Notes for Chapter 13 359 the most intriguing are the <splay trees= introduced by Sleator and Tarjan [418], which are <self-adjusting.= (See Tarjan [429] for a good description of splay trees.) Splay trees maintain balance without any explicit balance condition such as color. Instead, <splay operations= (which involve rotations) are performed within the tree every time an access is made. The amortized cost (see Chapter 16) of each oper- ation on an n-node tree is O.lg n/. Splay trees have been conjectured to perform within a constant factor of the best ofüine rotation-based tree. The best known competitive ratio (see Chapter 27) for a rotation-based tree is the Tango Tree of Demaine et al. [109]. Skip lists [369] provide an alternative to balanced binary trees. A skip list is a linked list that is augmented with a number of additional pointers. Each dictionary operation runs in O.lg n/ expected time on a skip list of n items. Part IV Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques Introduction This part covers three important techniques used in designing and analyzing efû- cient algorithms: dynamic programming (Chapter 14), greedy algorithms (Chap- ter 15), and amortized analysis (Chapter 16). Earlier parts have presented other widely applicable techniques, such as divide-and-conquer , randomization, and how to solve recurrences. The techniques in this part are somewhat more sophisticated, but you will be able to use them solve many computational problems. The themes introduced in this part will recur later in this book. Dynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems in which you make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution, each choice generates subproblems of the same form as the original problem, and the same subproblems arise repeatedly. The key strategy is to store the solution to each such subproblem rather than recompute it. Chapter 14 shows how this simple idea can sometimes transform exponential-time algorithms into polynomial-time algorithms. Like dynamic-programming algorithms, greedy algorithms typically apply to optimization problems in which you make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution. The idea of a greedy algorithm is to make each choice in a locally optimal manner, resulting in a faster algorithm than you get with dynamic program- ming. Chapter 15 will help you determine when the greedy approach works. The technique of amortized analysis applies to certain algorithms that perform a sequence of similar operations. Instead of bounding the cost of the sequence of operations by bounding the actual cost of each operation separately, an amortized analysis provides a worst-case bound on the actual cost of the entire sequence. One advantage of this approach is that although some operations might be expensive, many others might be cheap. You can use amortized analysis when designing algorithms, since the design of an algorithm and the analysis of its running time are often closely intertwined. Chapter 16 introduces three ways to perform an amortized analysis of an algorithm. 14 Dynamic Programming Dynamic programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves problems by combining the solutions to subproblems. (<Programming= in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.) As we saw in Chapters 2 and 4, divide-and-conquer algorithms partition the problem into disjoint subprob- lems, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine their solutions to solve the original problem. In contrast, dynamic programming applies when the subprob- lems overlap4that is, when subproblems share subsubproblems. In this context, a divide-and-conquer algorithm does more work than necessary, repeatedly solv- ing the common subsubproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem. Dynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems. Such prob- lems can have many possible solutions. Each solution has a value, and you want to ûnd a solution with the optimal (minimum or maximum) value. We call such a solution an optimal solution to the problem, as opposed to the optimal solution, since there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value. To develop a dynamic-programming algorithm, follow a sequence of four steps: 1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution. 2. Recursively deûne the value of an optimal solution. 3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion. 4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information. Steps 133 form the basis of a dynamic-programming solution to a problem. If you need only the value of an optimal solution, and not the solution itself, then you can omit step 4. When you do perform step 4, it often pays to maintain additional information during step 3 so that you can easily construct an optimal solution. The sections that follow use the dynamic-programming method to solve some optimization problems. Section 14.1 examines the problem of cutting a rod into 14.1 Rod cutting 363 rods of smaller length in a way that maximizes their total value. Section 14.2 shows how to multiply a chain of matrices while performing the fewest total scalar multiplications. Given these examples of dynamic programming, Section 14.3 dis- cusses two key characteristics that a problem must have for dynamic programming to be a viable solution technique. Section 14.4 then shows how to ûnd the longest common subsequence of two sequences via dynamic programming. Finally, Sec- tion 14.5 uses dynamic programming to construct binary search trees that are opti- mal, given a known distribution of keys to be looked up. 14.1 Rod cutting Our ûrst example uses dynamic programming to solve a simple problem in decid- ing where to cut steel rods. Serling Enterprises buys long steel rods and cuts them into shorter rods, which it then sells. Each cut is free. The management of Serling Enterprises wants to know the best way to cut up the rods. Serling Enterprises has a table giving, for i D 1; 2; : : :, the price p i in dollars that they charge for a rod of length i inches. The length of each rod in inches is always an integer. Figure 14.1 gives a sample price table. The rod-cutting problem is the following. Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices p i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, determine the maximum revenue r n ob- tainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. If the price p n for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal solution might require no cutting at all. Consider the case when n D 4. Figure 14.2 shows all the ways to cut up a rod of 4 inches in length, including the way with no cuts at all. Cutting a 4-inch rod into two 2-inch pieces produces revenue p 2 C p 2 D 5 C 5 D 10, which is optimal. Serling Enterprises can cut up a rod of length n in 2 n1 different ways, since they have an independent option of cutting, or not cutting, at distance i inches from the left end, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1. 1 We denote a decomposition into pieces using ordinary additive notation, so that 7 D 2 C 2 C 3 indicates that a rod of length 7 is cut into three pieces4two of length 2 and one of length 3. If an optimal solution cuts the rod into k pieces, for some 1 හ k හ n, then an optimal decomposition n D i 1 C i 2 C    C i k 1 If pieces are required to be cut in order of monotonically increasing size, there are fewer ways to consider. For n D 4, only 5 such ways are possible: parts (a), (b), (c), (e), and (h) in Figure 14.2. The number of ways is called the partition function, which is approximately equal to e  p 2n=3 =4n p 3. This quantity is less than 2 n1 , but still much greater than any polynomial in n. We won’t pursue this line of inquiry further, however. 364 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming length i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 price p i 1 5 8 9 10 17 17 20 24 30 Figure 14.1 A sample price table for rods.

The other n  1 arguments to max correspond to the maximum rev- enue obtained by making an initial cut of the rod into two pieces of size i and n  i , for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1, and then optimally cutting up those pieces further, ob- taining revenues r i and r ni from those two pieces. Since you don’t know ahead of time which value of i optimizes revenue, you have to consider all possible values for i and pick the one that maximizes revenue. You also have the option of picking no i at all if the greatest revenue comes from selling the rod uncut. To solve the original problem of size n, you solve smaller problems of the same type. Once you make the ûrst cut, the two resulting pieces form independent in- stances of the rod-cutting problem. The overall optimal solution incorporates op- timal solutions to the two resulting subproblems, maximizing revenue from each of those two pieces. We say that the rod-cutting problem exhibits optimal sub- structure: optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems, which you may solve independently. In a related, but slightly simpler, way to arrange a recursive structure for the rod-cutting problem, let’s view a decomposition as consisting of a ûrst piece of length i cut off the left-hand end, and then a right-hand remainder of length n  i . Only the remainder, and not the ûrst piece, may be further divided. Think of every decomposition of a length-n rod in this way: as a ûrst piece followed by some decomposition of the remainder. Then we can express the solution with no cuts at all by saying that the ûrst piece has size i D n and revenue p n and that the remainder has size 0 with corresponding revenue r 0 D 0. We thus obtain the following simpler version of equation (14.1): r n D max fp i C r ni W 1 හ i හ ng : (14.2) In this formulation, an optimal solution embodies the solution to only one related subproblem4the remainder4rather than two. Recursive top-down implementation The CUT-ROD procedure on the following page implements the computation im- plicit in equation (14.2) in a straightforward, top-down, recursive manner. It takes as input an array pŒ1 W n� of prices and an integer n, and it returns the maxi- mum revenue possible for a rod of length n. For length n D 0, no revenue is possible, and so CUT-ROD returns 0 in line 2. Line 3 initializes the max- imum revenue q to 1, so that the for loop in lines 435 correctly computes 366 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming q D max fp i C CUT-ROD.p; n  i / W 1 හ i හ ng. Line 6 then returns this value. A simple induction on n proves that this answer is equal to the desired answer r n , using equation (14.2). CUT-ROD.p; n/ 1 if n == 0 2 return 0 3 q D 1 4 for i D 1 to n 5 q D max fq; pŒi � C CUT-ROD.p; n  i /g 6 return q If you code up CUT-ROD in your favorite programming language and run it on your computer, you’ll ûnd that once the input size becomes moderately large, your program takes a long time to run. For n D 40, your program may take several minutes and possibly more than an hour. For large values of n, you’ll also discover that each time you increase n by 1, your program’s running time approximately doubles. Why is CUT-ROD so inefûcient? The problem is that CUT-ROD calls itself re- cursively over and over again with the same parameter values, which means that it solves the same subproblems repeatedly. Figure 14.3 shows a recursion tree demonstrating what happens for n D 4: CUT-ROD.p; n/ calls CUT-ROD.p; n  i / for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Equivalently, CUT-ROD.p; n/ calls CUT-ROD.p; j / for each j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. When this process unfolds recursively, the amount of work done, as a function of n, grows explosively. To analyze the running time of CUT-ROD, let T .n/ denote the total number of calls made to CUT-ROD.p; n/ for a particular value of n. This expression equals the number of nodes in a subtree whose root is labeled n in the recursion tree. The count includes the initial call at its root. Thus, T .0/ D 1 and T .n/ D 1 C n1 X j D0 T .j / : (14.3) The initial 1 is for the call at the root, and the term T .j / counts the number of calls (including recursive calls) due to the call CUT-ROD.p; n  i /, where j D n  i . As Exercise 14.1-1 asks you to show, T .n/ D 2 n ; (14.4) and so the running time of CUT-ROD is exponential in n. In retrospect, this exponential running time is not so surprising. CUT-ROD ex- plicitly considers all possible ways of cutting up a rod of length n. How many ways 14.1 Rod cutting 367 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 4 Figure 14.3 The recursion tree showing recursive calls resulting from a call C UT-ROD.p; n/ for n D 4. Each node label gives the size n of the corresponding subproblem, so that an edge from a parent with label s to a child with label t corresponds to cutting off an initial piece of size s  t and leaving a remaining subproblem of size t . A path from the root to a leaf corresponds to one of the 2 n1 ways of cutting up a rod of length n. In general, this recursion tree has 2 n nodes and 2 n1 leaves. are there? A rod of length n has n  1 potential locations to cut. Each possible way to cut up the rod makes a cut at some subset of these n  1 locations, including the empty set, which makes for no cuts. Viewing each cut location as a distinct mem- ber of a set of n  1 elements, you can see that there are 2 n1 subsets. Each leaf in the recursion tree of Figure 14.3 corresponds to one possible way to cut up the rod. Hence, the recursion tree has 2 n1 leaves. The labels on the simple path from the root to a leaf give the sizes of each remaining right-hand piece before making each cut. That is, the labels give the corresponding cut points, measured from the right-hand end of the rod. Using dynamic programming for optimal rod cutting Now, let’s see how to use dynamic programming to convert C UT-ROD into an efûcient algorithm. The dynamic-programming method works as follows. Instead of solving the same subproblems repeatedly, as in the naive recursion solution, arrange for each subproblem to be solved only once. There’s actually an obvious way to do so: the ûrst time you solve a subproblem, save its solution. If you need to refer to this subproblem’s solution again later, just look it up, rather than recomputing it. Saving subproblem solutions comes with a cost: the additional memory needed to store solutions. Dynamic programming thus serves as an example of a time- memory trade-off . The savings may be dramatic. For example, we’re about to use dynamic programming to go from the exponential-time algorithm for rod cutting 368 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming down to a ‚.n 2 /-time algorithm. A dynamic-programming approach runs in poly- nomial time when the number of distinct subproblems involved is polynomial in the input size and you can solve each such subproblem in polynomial time. There are usually two equivalent ways to implement a dynamic-programming approach. Solutions to the rod-cutting problem illustrate both of them. The ûrst approach is top-down with memoization. 2 In this approach, you write the procedure recursively in a natural manner, but modiûed to save the result of each subproblem (usually in an array or hash table). The procedure now ûrst checks to see whether it has previously solved this subproblem. If so, it returns the saved value, saving further computation at this level. If not, the procedure computes the value in the usual manner but also saves it. We say that the recursive procedure has been memoized: it <remembers= what results it has computed previously. The second approach is the bottom-up method. This approach typically de- pends on some natural notion of the <size= of a subproblem, such that solving any particular subproblem depends only on solving <smaller= subproblems. Solve the subproblems in size order, smallest ûrst, storing the solution to each subproblem when it is ûrst solved. In this way, when solving a particular subproblem, there are already saved solutions for all of the smaller subproblems its solution depends upon. You need to solve each subproblem only once, and when you ûrst see it, you have already solved all of its prerequisite subproblems. These two approaches yield algorithms with the same asymptotic running time, except in unusual circumstances where the top-down approach does not actually recurse to examine all possible subproblems. The bottom-up approach often has much better constant factors, since it has lower overhead for procedure calls. The procedures MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD and MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX on the facing page demonstrate how to memoize the top-down C UT-ROD proce- dure. The main procedure MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD initializes a new auxiliary array rŒ0 W n� with the value 1 which, since known revenue values are always nonneg- ative, is a convenient choice for denoting <unknown.= M EMOIZED-CUT-ROD then calls its helper procedure, MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX, which is just the memo- ized version of the exponential-time procedure, C UT-ROD. It ûrst checks in line 1 to see whether the desired value is already known and, if it is, then line 2 returns it. Otherwise, lines 337 compute the desired value q in the usual manner, line 8 saves it in rŒn�, and line 9 returns it. The bottom-up version, BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD on the next page, is even sim- pler. Using the bottom-up dynamic-programming approach, B OTTOM-UP-CUT- ROD takes advantage of the natural ordering of the subproblems: a subproblem of 2 The technical term <memoization= is not a misspelling of <memorization.= The word <memoiza- tion= comes from <memo,= since the technique consists of recording a value to be looked up later. 14.1 Rod cutting 369 MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD .p; n/ 1 let rŒ0 W n� be a new array // will remember solution values in r 2 for i D 0 to n 3 rŒi � D 1 4 return MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX .p; n; r/ MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX .p; n; r/ 1 if rŒn�  0 // already have a solution for length n? 2 return rŒn� 3 if n == 0 4 q D 0 5 else q D 1 6 for i D 1 to n // i is the position of the ûrst cut 7 q D max fq; pŒi � C MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX .p; n  i; r/g 8 rŒn� D q // remember the solution value for length n 9 return q BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD .p; n/ 1 let rŒ0 W n� be a new array // will remember solution values in r 2 rŒ0� D 0 3 for j D 1 to n // for increasing rod length j 4 q D 1 5 for i D 1 to j // i is the position of the ûrst cut 6 q D max fq; pŒi � C rŒj  i �g 7 rŒj � D q // remember the solution value for length j 8 return rŒn� size i is <smaller= than a subproblem of size j if i < j . Thus, the procedure solves subproblems of sizes j D 0; 1; : : : ; n, in that order. Line 1 of BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD creates a new array rŒ0 W n� in which to save the results of the subproblems, and line 2 initializes rŒ0� to 0, since a rod of length 0 earns no revenue. Lines 336 solve each subproblem of size j , for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n, in order of increasing size. The approach used to solve a problem of a particular size j is the same as that used by CUT-ROD, except that line 6 now directly refer- ences array entry rŒj i � instead of making a recursive call to solve the subproblem of size j  i . Line 7 saves in rŒj � the solution to the subproblem of size j . Finally, line 8 returns rŒn�, which equals the optimal value r n . The bottom-up and top-down versions have the same asymptotic running time. The running time of BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD is ‚.n 2 /, due to its doubly nested 370 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 3 0 1 2 4 Figure 14.4 The subproblem graph for the rod-cutting problem with n D 4. The vertex labels give the sizes of the corresponding subproblems. A directed edge .x; y/ indicates that solving subprob- lem x requires a solution to subproblem y. This graph is a reduced version of the recursion tree of Figure 14.3, in which all nodes with the same label are collapsed into a single vertex and all edges go from parent to child. loop structure. The number of iterations of its inner for loop, in lines 536, forms an arithmetic series. The running time of its top-down counterpart, MEMOIZED- CUT-ROD, is also ‚.n 2 /, although this running time may be a little harder to see. Because a recursive call to solve a previously solved subproblem returns immedi- ately, MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD solves each subproblem just once. It solves subprob- lems for sizes 0; 1; : : : ; n. To solve a subproblem of size n, the for loop of lines 637 iterates n times. Thus, the total number of iterations of this for loop, over all re- cursive calls of MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD, forms an arithmetic series, giving a total of ‚.n 2 / iterations, just like the inner for loop of BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD. (We actually are using a form of aggregate analysis here. We’ll see aggregate analysis in detail in Section 16.1.) Subproblem graphs When you think about a dynamic-programming problem, you need to understand the set of subproblems involved and how subproblems depend on one another. The subproblem graph for the problem embodies exactly this information. Fig- ure 14.4 shows the subproblem graph for the rod-cutting problem with n D 4. It is a directed graph, containing one vertex for each distinct subproblem. The sub- problem graph has a directed edge from the vertex for subproblem x to the vertex for subproblem y if determining an optimal solution for subproblem x involves directly considering an optimal solution for subproblem y . For example, the sub- problem graph contains an edge from x to y if a top-down recursive procedure for solving x directly calls itself to solve y . You can think of the subproblem graph as 14.1 Rod cutting 371 a <reduced= or <collapsed= version of the recursion tree for the top-down recursive method, with all nodes for the same subproblem coalesced into a single vertex and all edges directed from parent to child. The bottom-up method for dynamic programming considers the vertices of the subproblem graph in such an order that you solve the subproblems y adjacent to a given subproblem x before you solve subproblem x . (As Section B.4 notes, the adjacency relation in a directed graph is not necessarily symmetric.) Using ter- minology that we’ll see in Section 20.4, in a bottom-up dynamic-programming algorithm, you consider the vertices of the subproblem graph in an order that is a <reverse topological sort,= or a <topological sort of the transpose= of the subprob- lem graph. In other words, no subproblem is considered until all of the subprob- lems it depends upon have been solved. Similarly, using notions that we’ll visit in Section 20.3, you can view the top-down method (with memoization) for dynamic programming as a <depth-ûrst search= of the subproblem graph. The size of the subproblem graph G D .V; E/ can help you determine the running time of the dynamic-programming algorithm. Since you solve each sub- problem just once, the running time is the sum of the times needed to solve each subproblem. Typically, the time to compute the solution to a subproblem is propor- tional to the degree (number of outgoing edges) of the corresponding vertex in the subproblem graph, and the number of subproblems is equal to the number of ver- tices in the subproblem graph. In this common case, the running time of dynamic programming is linear in the number of vertices and edges. Reconstructing a solution The procedures MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD and BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD return the value of an optimal solution to the rod-cutting problem, but they do not return the solution itself : a list of piece sizes. Let’s see how to extend the dynamic-programming approach to record not only the optimal value computed for each subproblem, but also a choice that led to the optimal value. With this information, you can readily print an optimal solution. The procedure EXTENDED-BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD on the next page computes, for each rod size j , not only the maximum revenue r j , but also s j , the optimal size of the ûrst piece to cut off. It’s similar to BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD, except that it creates the array s in line 1, and it updates sŒj � in line 8 to hold the optimal size i of the ûrst piece to cut off when solving a subproblem of size j . The procedure PRINT-CUT-ROD-SOLUTION on the following page takes as in- put an array pŒ1 W n� of prices and a rod size n. It calls EXTENDED-BOTTOM- UP-CUT-ROD to compute the array sŒ1 W n� of optimal ûrst-piece sizes. Then it prints out the complete list of piece sizes in an optimal decomposition of a 372 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming rod of length n. For the sample price chart appearing in Figure 14.1, the call EXTENDED-BOTTOM-UP-CUT-ROD .p; 10/ returns the following arrays: i 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 rŒi � 0 1 5 8 10 13 17 18 22 25 30 sŒi � 1 2 3 2 2 6 1 2 3 10 A call to PRINT-CUT-ROD-SOLUTION .p; 10/ prints just 10, but a call with n D 7 prints the cuts 1 and 6, which correspond to the ûrst optimal decomposition for r 7 given earlier.

Deûne the density of a rod of length i to be p i =i , that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of length n cuts off a ûrst piece of length i , where 1 හ i හ n, having maximum 14.2 Matrix-chain multiplication 373 density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of length n  i . 14.1-3 Consider a modiûcation of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a price p i for each rod, each cut incurs a ûxed cost of c . The revenue associated with a solution is now the sum of the prices of the pieces minus the costs of making the cuts. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to solve this modiûed problem. 14.1-4 Modify CUT-ROD and MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX so that their for loops go up to only bn=2c, rather than up to n. What other changes to the procedures do you need to make? How are their running times affected? 14.1-5 Modify MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD to return not only the value but the actual solution. 14.1-6 The Fibonacci numbers are deûned by recurrence (3.31) on page 69. Give an O.n/-time dynamic-programming algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Draw the subproblem graph. How many vertices and edges does the graph contain? 14.2 Matrix-chain multiplication Our next example of dynamic programming is an algorithm that solves the problem of matrix-chain multiplication. Given a sequence (chain) hA 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n i of n matrices to be multiplied, where the matrices aren’t necessarily square, the goal is to compute the product 1 A 2    A n : (14.5) using the standard algorithm 3 for multiplying rectangular matrices, which we’ll see in a moment, while minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. You can evaluate the expression (14.5) using the algorithm for multiplying pairs of rectangular matrices as a subroutine once you have parenthesized it to resolve all ambiguities in how the matrices are multiplied together. Matrix multiplication is associative, and so all parenthesizations yield the same product. A product of 3 None of the three methods from Sections 4.1 and Section 4.2 can be used directly, because they apply only to square matrices. 374 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming matrices is fully parenthesized if it is either a single matrix or the product of two fully parenthesized matrix products, surrounded by parentheses. For example, if the chain of matrices is hA 1 ; A 2 ; A 3 ; A 4 i, then you can fully parenthesize the prod- uct A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 in ûve distinct ways: .A 1 .A 2 .A 3 A 4 /// ; .A 1 ..A 2 A 3 /A 4 // ; ..A 1 A 2 /.A 3 A 4 // ; ..A 1 .A 2 A 3 //A 4 / ; ...A 1 A 2 /A 3 /A 4 / : How you parenthesize a chain of matrices can have a dramatic impact on the cost of evaluating the product. Consider ûrst the cost of multiplying two rectangu- lar matrices. The standard algorithm is given by the procedure R ECTANGULAR- MATRIX-MULTIPLY, which generalizes the square-matrix multiplication proce- dure MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 81. The RECTANGULAR-MATRIX-MULTIPLY procedure computes C D C C A  B for three matrices A D .a ij /, B D .b ij /, and C D .c ij /, where A is p  q, B is q  r , and C is p  r . RECTANGULAR-MATRIX-MULTIPLY .A; B; C; p; q; r/ 1 for i D 1 to p 2 for j D 1 to r 3 for k D 1 to q 4 c ij D c ij C a i k  b kj The running time of RECTANGULAR-MATRIX-MULTIPLY is dominated by the number of scalar multiplications in line 4, which is pqr . Therefore, we’ll consider the cost of multiplying matrices to be the number of scalar multiplications. (The number of scalar multiplications dominates even if we consider initializing C D 0 to perform just C D A  B .) To illustrate the different costs incurred by different parenthesizations of a ma- trix product, consider the problem of a chain hA 1 ; A 2 ; A 3 i of three matrices. Sup- pose that the dimensions of the matrices are 10  100, 100  5, and 5  50, re- spectively. Multiplying according to the parenthesization ..A 1 A 2 /A 3 / performs 10  100  5 D 5000 scalar multiplications to compute the 10  5 matrix prod- uct A 1 A 2 , plus another 10  5  50 D 2500 scalar multiplications to multiply this matrix by A 3 , for a total of 7500 scalar multiplications. Multiplying according to the alternative parenthesization .A 1 .A 2 A 3 // performs 100  5  50 D 25,000 scalar multiplications to compute the 100  50 matrix product A 2 A 3 , plus another 10  100  50 D 50,000 scalar multiplications to multiply A 1 by this matrix, for a 14.2 Matrix-chain multiplication 375 total of 75,000 scalar multiplications. Thus, computing the product according to the ûrst parenthesization is 10 times faster. We state the matrix-chain multiplication problem as follows: given a chain hA 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n i of n matrices, where for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, matrix A i has dimension p i 1  p i , fully parenthesize the product A 1 A 2    A n in a way that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications. The input is the sequence of dimensions hp 0 ; p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n i. The matrix-chain multiplication problem does not entail actually multiplying matrices. The goal is only to determine an order for multiplying matrices that has the lowest cost. Typically, the time invested in determining this optimal order is more than paid for by the time saved later on when actually performing the matrix multiplications (such as performing only 7500 scalar multiplications instead of 75,000). Counting the number of parenthesizations Before solving the matrix-chain multiplication problem by dynamic programming, let us convince ourselves that exhaustively checking all possible parenthesizations is not an efûcient algorithm. Denote the number of alternative parenthesizations of a sequence of n matrices by P .n/. When n D 1, the sequence consists of just one matrix, and therefore there is only one way to fully parenthesize the matrix product. When n  2, a fully parenthesized matrix product is the product of two fully parenthesized matrix subproducts, and the split between the two subproducts may occur between the kth and .k C 1/st matrices for any k D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1. Thus, we obtain the recurrence P .n/ D ) 1 if n D 1 ; n1 X kD1 P .k/P .n  k/ if n  2 : (14.6) Problem 12-4 on page 329 asked you to show that the solution to a similar recur- rence is the sequence of Catalan numbers, which grows as �.4 n =n 3=2 /. A simpler exercise (see Exercise 14.2-3) is to show that the solution to the recurrence (14.6) is �.2 n /. The number of solutions is thus exponential in n, and the brute-force method of exhaustive search makes for a poor strategy when determining how to optimally parenthesize a matrix chain. Applying dynamic programming Let’s use the dynamic-programming method to determine how to optimally paren- thesize a matrix chain, by following the four-step sequence that we stated at the beginning of this chapter: 376 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution. 2. Recursively deûne the value of an optimal solution. 3. Compute the value of an optimal solution. 4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information. We’ll go through these steps in order, demonstrating how to apply each step to the problem. Step 1: The structure of an optimal parenthesization In the ûrst step of the dynamic-programming method, you ûnd the optimal sub- structure and then use it to construct an optimal solution to the problem from opti- mal solutions to subproblems. To perform this step for the matrix-chain multipli- cation problem, it’s convenient to ûrst introduce some notation. Let A i Wj , where i හ j , denote the matrix that results from evaluating the product A i A i C1    A j . If the problem is nontrivial, that is, i < j , then to parenthesize the product A i A i C1    A j , the product must split between A k and A kC1 for some integer k in the range i හ k < j . That is, for some value of k, ûrst compute the matrices A i Wk and A kC1Wj , and then multiply them together to produce the ûnal product A i Wj . The cost of parenthesizing this way is the cost of computing the matrix A i Wk , plus the cost of computing A kC1Wj , plus the cost of multiplying them together. The optimal substructure of this problem is as follows. Suppose that to op- timally parenthesize A i A i C1    A j , you split the product between A k and A kC1 . Then the way you parenthesize the <preûx= subchain A i A i C1    A k within this optimal parenthesization of A i A i C1    A j must be an optimal parenthesization of A i A i C1    A k . Why? If there were a less costly way to parenthesize A i A i C1    A k , then you could substitute that parenthesization in the optimal parenthesization of A i A i C1    A j to produce another way to parenthesize A i A i C1    A j whose cost is lower than the optimum: a contradiction. A similar observation holds for how to parenthesize the subchain A kC1 A kC2    A j in the optimal parenthesization of A i A i C1    A j : it must be an optimal parenthesization of A kC1 A kC2    A j . Now let’s use the optimal substructure to show how to construct an optimal solution to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. Any solution to a nontrivial instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem requires splitting the product, and any optimal solution contains within it optimal solutions to subprob- lem instances. Thus, to build an optimal solution to an instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem, split the problem into two subproblems (optimally paren- thesizing A i A i C1    A k and A kC1 A kC2    A j ), ûnd optimal solutions to the two subproblem instances, and then combine these optimal subproblem solutions. To ensure that you’ve examined the optimal split, you must consider all possible splits. 14.2 Matrix-chain multiplication 377 Step 2: A recursive solution The next step is to deûne the cost of an optimal solution recursively in terms of the optimal solutions to subproblems. For the matrix-chain multiplication problem, a subproblem is to determine the minimum cost of parenthesizing A i A i C1    A j for 1 හ i හ j හ n. Given the input dimensions hp 0 ; p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n i, an index pair i; j speciûes a subproblem. Let mŒi; j � be the minimum number of scalar multi- plications needed to compute the matrix A i Wj . For the full problem, the lowest-cost way to compute A 1Wn is thus mŒ1; n�. We can deûne mŒi; j � recursively as follows. If i D j , the problem is trivial: the chain consists of just one matrix A i Wi D A i , so that no scalar multiplications are necessary to compute the product. Thus, mŒi; i � D 0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. To compute mŒi; j � when i < j , we take advantage of the structure of an optimal solution from step 1. Suppose that an optimal parenthesization splits the product A i A i C1    A j between A k and A kC1 , where i හ k < j . Then, mŒi; j � equals the minimum cost mŒi; k� for computing the subproduct A i Wk , plus the minimum cost mŒk C 1; j � for computing the subproduct, A kC1Wj , plus the cost of multiplying these two matrices together. Because each matrix A i is p i 1  p i , computing the matrix product A i Wk A kC1Wj takes p i 1 p k p j scalar multiplications. Thus, we obtain mŒi; j � D mŒi; k� C mŒk C 1; j � C p i 1 p k p j : This recursive equation assumes that you know the value of k. But you don’t, at least not yet. You have to try all possible values of k. How many are there? Just j  i , namely k D i; i C 1; : : : ; j  1. Since the optimal parenthesization must use one of these values for k, you need only check them all to ûnd the best. Thus, the recursive deûnition for the minimum cost of parenthesizing the product A i A i C1    A j becomes mŒi; j � D ( 0 if i D j ; min fmŒi; k� C mŒk C 1; j � C p i 1 p k p j W i හ k < j g if i < j : (14.7) The mŒi; j � values give the costs of optimal solutions to subproblems, but they do not provide all the information you need to construct an optimal solution. To help you do so, let’s deûne sŒi; j � to be a value of k at which you split the product A i A i C1    A j in an optimal parenthesization. That is, sŒi; j � equals a value k such that mŒi; j � D mŒi; k� C mŒk C 1; j � C p i 1 p k p j . Step 3: Computing the optimal costs At this point, you could write a recursive algorithm based on recurrence (14.7) to compute the minimum cost mŒ1; n� for multiplying A 1 A 2    A n . But as we saw 378 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming for the rod-cutting problem, and as we shall see in Section 14.3, this recursive algorithm takes exponential time. That’s no better than the brute-force method of checking each way of parenthesizing the product. Fortunately, there aren’t all that many distinct subproblems: just one subproblem for each choice of i and j satisfying 1 හ i හ j හ n, or ã n 2 ä C n D ‚.n 2 / in all. 4 A recursive algorithm may encounter each subproblem many times in different branches of its recursion tree. This property of overlapping subproblems is the second hallmark of when dynamic programming applies (the ûrst hallmark being optimal substructure). Instead of computing the solution to recurrence (14.7) recursively, let’s com- pute the optimal cost by using a tabular, bottom-up approach, as in the procedure MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER. (The corresponding top-down approach using memo- ization appears in Section 14.3.) The input is a sequence p D hp 0 ; p 1 ; : : : ; p n i of matrix dimensions, along with n, so that for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, matrix A i has di- mensions p i 1  p i . The procedure uses an auxiliary table mŒ1 W n; 1 W n� to store the mŒi; j � costs and another auxiliary table sŒ1 W n  1; 2 W n� that records which index k achieved the optimal cost in computing mŒi; j �. The table s will help in constructing an optimal solution. MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER .p; n/ 1 let mŒ1 W n; 1 W n� and sŒ1 W n  1; 2 W n� be new tables 2 for i D 1 to n // chain length 1 3 mŒi; i � D 0 4 for l D 2 to n // l is the chain length 5 for i D 1 to n  l C 1 // chain begins at A i 6 j D i C l  1 // chain ends at A j 7 mŒi; j � D 1 8 for k D i to j  1 // try A i Wk A kC1Wj 9 q D mŒi; k� C mŒk C 1; j � C p i 1 p k p j 10 if q < mŒi; j � 11 mŒi; j � D q // remember this cost 12 sŒi; j � D k // remember this index 13 return m and s In what order should the algorithm ûll in the table entries? To answer this ques- tion, let’s see which entries of the table need to be accessed when computing the 4 The ã n 2 ä term counts all pairs in which i < j . Because i and j may be equal, we need to add in the n term. 14.2 Matrix-chain multiplication 379 cost mŒi; j �. Equation (14.7) tells us that to compute the cost of matrix prod- uct A i Wj , ûrst the costs of the products A i Wk and A kC1Wj need to have been com- puted for all k D i; i C 1; : : : ; j  1. The chain A i A i C1    A j consists of j  i C 1 matrices, and the chains A i A i C1 : : : A k and A kC1 A kC2 : : : A j consist of k  i C 1 and j  k matrices, respectively. Since k < j , a chain of k  i C 1 matrices consists of fewer than j  i C 1 matrices. Likewise, since k  i , a chain of j  k matrices consists of fewer than j  i C 1 matrices. Thus, the algorithm should ûll in the table m from shorter matrix chains to longer matrix chains. That is, for the subproblem of optimally parenthesizing the chain A i A i C1    A j , it makes sense to consider the subproblem size as the length j  i C 1 of the chain. Now, let’s see how the MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER procedure ûlls in the mŒi; j � entries in order of increasing chain length. Lines 233 initialize mŒi; i � D 0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, since any matrix chain with just one matrix requires no scalar multiplications. In the for loop of lines 4312, the loop variable l denotes the length of matrix chains whose minimum costs are being computed. Each iteration of this loop uses recurrence (14.7) to compute mŒi; i C l  1� for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  l C 1. In the ûrst iteration, l D 2, and so the loop computes mŒi; i C1� for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n1: the minimum costs for chains of length l D 2. The second time through the loop, it computes mŒi; i C 2� for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  2: the minimum costs for chains of length l D 3. And so on, ending with a single matrix chain of length l D n and computing mŒ1; n�. When lines 7312 compute an mŒi; j � cost, this cost depends only on table entries mŒi; k� and mŒk C 1; j �, which have already been computed. Figure 14.5 illustrates the m and s tables, as ûlled in by the MATRIX-CHAIN- ORDER procedure on a chain of n D 6 matrices. Since mŒi; j � is deûned only for i හ j , only the portion of the table m on or above the main diagonal is used. The ûgure shows the table rotated to make the main diagonal run horizontally. The matrix chain is listed along the bottom. Using this layout, the minimum cost mŒi; j � for multiplying a subchain A i A i C1    A j of matrices appears at the intersection of lines running northeast from A i and northwest from A j . Reading across, each diagonal in the table contains the entries for matrix chains of the same length. MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER computes the rows from bottom to top and from left to right within each row. It computes each entry mŒi; j � using the products p i 1 p k p j for k D i; i C 1; : : : ; j  1 and all entries southwest and southeast from mŒi; j �. A simple inspection of the nested loop structure of MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER yields a running time of O.n 3 / for the algorithm. The loops are nested three deep, and each loop index (l , i , and k) takes on at most n  1 values. Exercise 14.2-5 asks you to show that the running time of this algorithm is in fact also �.n 3 /. The al- gorithm requires ‚.n 2 / space to store the m and s tables. Thus, MATRIX-CHAIN- ORDER is much more efûcient than the exponential-time method of enumerating all possible parenthesizations and checking each one. 380 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming A 6 A 5 A 4 A 3 A 2 A 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 15,750 2,625 750 1,000 5,000 7,875 4,375 2,500 3,500 9,375 7,125 5,375 11,875 10,500 15,125 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 j i m 1 2 3 4 5 1 3 3 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 j i s Figure 14.5 The m and s tables computed by MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER for n D 6 and the follow- ing matrix dimensions: matrix A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 dimension 30  35 35  15 15  5 5  10 10  20 20  25 The tables are rotated so that the main diagonal runs horizontally.

From an engi- neering perspective, when should you look for a dynamic-programming solution to a problem? In this section, we’ll examine the two key ingredients that an optimiza- tion problem must have in order for dynamic programming to apply: optimal sub- structure and overlapping subproblems. We’ll also revisit and discuss more fully how memoization might help you take advantage of the overlapping-subproblems property in a top-down recursive approach. Optimal substructure The ûrst step in solving an optimization problem by dynamic programming is to characterize the structure of an optimal solution. Recall that a problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it opti- mal solutions to subproblems. When a problem exhibits optimal substructure, that gives you a good clue that dynamic programming might apply. (As Chapter 15 discusses, it also might mean that a greedy strategy applies, however.) Dynamic programming builds an optimal solution to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. Consequently, you must take care to ensure that the range of sub- problems you consider includes those used in an optimal solution. Optimal substructure was key to solving both of the previous problems in this chapter. In Section 14.1, we observed that the optimal way of cutting up a rod of length n (if Serling Enterprises makes any cuts at all) involves optimally cutting up the two pieces resulting from the ûrst cut. In Section 14.2, we noted that an optimal parenthesization of the matrix chain product A i A i C1    A j that splits the product between A k and A kC1 contains within it optimal solutions to the problems of parenthesizing A i A i C1    A k and A kC1 A kC2    A j . 14.3 Elements of dynamic programming 383 You will ûnd yourself following a common pattern in discovering optimal sub- structure: 1. You show that a solution to the problem consists of making a choice, such as choosing an initial cut in a rod or choosing an index at which to split the matrix chain. Making this choice leaves one or more subproblems to be solved. 2. You suppose that for a given problem, you are given the choice that leads to an optimal solution. You do not concern yourself yet with how to determine this choice. You just assume that it has been given to you. 3. Given this choice, you determine which subproblems ensue and how to best characterize the resulting space of subproblems. 4. You show that the solutions to the subproblems used within an optimal solution to the problem must themselves be optimal by using a <cut-and-paste= tech- nique. You do so by supposing that each of the subproblem solutions is not optimal and then deriving a contradiction. In particular, by <cutting out= the nonoptimal solution to each subproblem and <pasting in= the optimal one, you show that you can get a better solution to the original problem, thus contradict- ing your supposition that you already had an optimal solution. If an optimal solution gives rise to more than one subproblem, they are typically so similar that you can modify the cut-and-paste argument for one to apply to the others with little effort. To characterize the space of subproblems, a good rule of thumb says to try to keep the space as simple as possible and then expand it as necessary. For example, the space of subproblems for the rod-cutting problem contained the problems of optimally cutting up a rod of length i for each size i . This subproblem space worked well, and it was not necessary to try a more general space of subproblems. Conversely, suppose that you tried to constrain the subproblem space for matrix- chain multiplication to matrix products of the form A 1 A 2    A j . As before, an optimal parenthesization must split this product between A k and A kC1 for some 1 හ k < j . Unless you can guarantee that k always equals j  1, you will ûnd that you have subproblems of the form A 1 A 2    A k and A kC1 A kC2    A j . Moreover, the latter subproblem does not have the form A 1 A 2    A j . To solve this problem by dynamic programming, you need to allow the subproblems to vary at <both ends.= That is, both i and j need to vary in the subproblem of parenthesizing the product A i A i C1    A j . Optimal substructure varies across problem domains in two ways: 1. how many subproblems an optimal solution to the original problem uses, and 2. how many choices you have in determining which subproblem(s) to use in an optimal solution. 384 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming In the rod-cutting problem, an optimal solution for cutting up a rod of size n uses just one subproblem (of size n  i ), but we have to consider n choices for i in order to determine which one yields an optimal solution. Matrix-chain multiplication for the subchain A i A i C1    A j serves an example with two subproblems and j  i choices. For a given matrix A k where the product splits, two subproblems arise4 parenthesizing A i A i C1    A k and parenthesizing A kC1 A kC2    A j 4and we have to solve both of them optimally. Once we determine the optimal solutions to sub- problems, we choose from among j  i candidates for the index k. Informally, the running time of a dynamic-programming algorithm depends on the product of two factors: the number of subproblems overall and how many choices you look at for each subproblem. In rod cutting, we had ‚.n/ subproblems overall, and at most n choices to examine for each, yielding an O.n 2 / running time. Matrix-chain multiplication had ‚.n 2 / subproblems overall, and each had at most n  1 choices, giving an O.n 3 / running time (actually, a ‚.n 3 / running time, by Exercise 14.2-5). Usually, the subproblem graph gives an alternative way to perform the same analysis. Each vertex corresponds to a subproblem, and the choices for a subprob- lem are the edges incident from that subproblem. Recall that in rod cutting, the subproblem graph has n vertices and at most n edges per vertex, yielding an O.n 2 / running time. For matrix-chain multiplication, if you were to draw the subprob- lem graph, it would have ‚.n 2 / vertices and each vertex would have degree at most n  1, giving a total of O.n 3 / vertices and edges. Dynamic programming often uses optimal substructure in a bottom-up fashion. That is, you ûrst ûnd optimal solutions to subproblems and, having solved the subproblems, you ûnd an optimal solution to the problem. Finding an optimal so- lution to the problem entails making a choice among subproblems as to which you will use in solving the problem. The cost of the problem solution is usually the subproblem costs plus a cost that is directly attributable to the choice itself. In rod cutting, for example, ûrst we solved the subproblems of determining optimal ways to cut up rods of length i for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, and then we determined which of these subproblems yielded an optimal solution for a rod of length n, us- ing equation (14.2). The cost attributable to the choice itself is the term p i in equation (14.2). In matrix-chain multiplication, we determined optimal parenthe- sizations of subchains of A i A i C1    A j , and then we chose the matrix A k at which to split the product. The cost attributable to the choice itself is the term p i 1 p k p j . Chapter 15 explores <greedy algorithms,= which have many similarities to dy- namic programming. In particular, problems to which greedy algorithms apply have optimal substructure. One major difference between greedy algorithms and dynamic programming is that instead of ûrst ûnding optimal solutions to subprob- lems and then making an informed choice, greedy algorithms ûrst make a <greedy= choice4the choice that looks best at the time4and then solve a resulting subprob- 14.3 Elements of dynamic programming 385 lem, without bothering to solve all possible related smaller subproblems. Surpris- ingly, in some cases this strategy works! Subtleties You should be careful not to assume that optimal substructure applies when it does not. Consider the following two problems whose input consists of a directed graph G D .V; E/ and vertices u; v 2 V . Unweighted shortest path: 5 Find a path from u to v consisting of the fewest edges. Such a path must be simple, since removing a cycle from a path produces a path with fewer edges. Unweighted longest simple path: Find a simple path from u to v consisting of the most edges. (Without the requirement that the path must be simple, the problem is undeûned, since repeatedly traversing a cycle creates paths with an arbitrarily large number of edges.) The unweighted shortest-path problem exhibits optimal substructure. Here’s how. Suppose that u ¤ v, so that the problem is nontrivial. Then, any path p from u to v must contain an intermediate vertex, say w. (Note that w may be u or v.) Then, we can decompose the path u p ❀ v into subpaths u p 1 ❀ w p 2 ❀ v. The number of edges in p equals the number of edges in p 1 plus the number of edges in p 2 . We claim that if p is an optimal (i.e., shortest) path from u to v, then p 1 must be a shortest path from u to w. Why? As suggested earlier, use a <cut-and- paste= argument: if there were another path, say p 0 1 , from u to w with fewer edges than p 1 , then we could cut out p 1 and paste in p 0 1 to produce a path u p 0 1 ❀ w p 2 ❀ v with fewer edges than p, thus contradicting p’s optimality. Likewise, p 2 must be a shortest path from w to v. Thus, to ûnd a shortest path from u to v, consider all intermediate vertices w, ûnd a shortest path from u to w and a shortest path from w to v, and choose an intermediate vertex w that yields the overall shortest path. Section 23.2 uses a variant of this observation of optimal substructure to ûnd a shortest path between every pair of vertices on a weighted, directed graph. You might be tempted to assume that the problem of ûnding an unweighted longest simple path exhibits optimal substructure as well. After all, if we decom- pose a longest simple path u p ❀ v into subpaths u p 1 ❀ w p 2 ❀ v, then mustn’t p 1 be a longest simple path from u to w, and mustn’t p 2 be a longest simple path from w to v? The answer is no! Figure 14.6 supplies an example. Consider the 5 We use the term <unweighted= to distinguish this problem from that of ûnding shortest paths with weighted edges, which we shall see in Chapters 22 and 23. You can use the breadth-ûrst search technique of Chapter 20 to solve the unweighted problem. 386 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming q r s t Figure 14.6 A directed graph showing that the problem of ûnding a longest simple path in an unweighted directed graph does not have optimal substructure. The path q ! r ! t is a longest simple path from q to t , but the subpath q ! r is not a longest simple path from q to r , nor is the subpath r ! t a longest simple path from r to t . path q ! r ! t , which is a longest simple path from q to t . Is q ! r a longest simple path from q to r ? No, for the path q ! s ! t ! r is a simple path that is longer. Is r ! t a longest simple path from r to t ? No again, for the path r ! q ! s ! t is a simple path that is longer. This example shows that for longest simple paths, not only does the problem lack optimal substructure, but you cannot necessarily assemble a <legal= solution to the problem from solutions to subproblems. If you combine the longest simple paths q ! s ! t ! r and r ! q ! s ! t , you get the path q ! s ! t ! r ! q ! s ! t , which is not simple. Indeed, the problem of ûnding an unweighted longest simple path does not appear to have any sort of optimal substructure. No efûcient dynamic-programming algorithm for this problem has ever been found. In fact, this problem is NP-complete, which4as we shall see in Chapter 344means that we are unlikely to ûnd a way to solve it in polynomial time. Why is the substructure of a longest simple path so different from that of a short- est path? Although a solution to a problem for both longest and shortest paths uses two subproblems, the subproblems in ûnding the longest simple path are not inde- pendent, whereas for shortest paths they are. What do we mean by subproblems being independent? We mean that the solution to one subproblem does not affect the solution to another subproblem of the same problem. For the example of Fig- ure 14.6, we have the problem of ûnding a longest simple path from q to t with two subproblems: ûnding longest simple paths from q to r and from r to t . For the ûrst of these subproblems, we chose the path q ! s ! t ! r , which used the vertices s and t . These vertices cannot appear in a solution to the second sub- problem, since the combination of the two solutions to subproblems yields a path that is not simple. If vertex t cannot be in the solution to the second problem, then there is no way to solve it, since t is required to be on the path that forms the solu- tion, and it is not the vertex where the subproblem solutions are <spliced= together (that vertex being r ). Because vertices s and t appear in one subproblem solution, they cannot appear in the other subproblem solution. One of them must be in the solution to the other subproblem, however, and an optimal solution requires both. 14.3 Elements of dynamic programming 387 Thus, we say that these subproblems are not independent. Looked at another way, using resources in solving one subproblem (those resources being vertices) renders them unavailable for the other subproblem. Why, then, are the subproblems independent for ûnding a shortest path? The answer is that by nature, the subproblems do not share resources. We claim that if a vertex w is on a shortest path p from u to v, then we can splice together any shortest path u p 1 ❀ w and any shortest path w p 2 ❀ v to produce a shortest path from u to v. We are assured that, other than w, no vertex can appear in both paths p 1 and p 2 . Why? Suppose that some vertex x ¤ w appears in both p 1 and p 2 , so that we can decompose p 1 as u p ux ❀ x ❀ w and p 2 as w ❀ x p xv ❀ v. By the optimal substructure of this problem, path p has as many edges as p 1 and p 2 together. Let’s say that p has e edges. Now let us construct a path p 0 D u p ux ❀ x p xv ❀ v from u to v. Because we have excised the paths from x to w and from w to x , each of which contains at least one edge, path p 0 contains at most e  2 edges, which contradicts the assumption that p is a shortest path. Thus, we are assured that the subproblems for the shortest-path problem are independent. The two problems examined in Sections 14.1 and 14.2 have independent sub- problems. In matrix-chain multiplication, the subproblems are multiplying sub- chains A i A i C1    A k and A kC1 A kC2    A j . These subchains are disjoint, so that no matrix could possibly be included in both of them. In rod cutting, to determine the best way to cut up a rod of length n, we looked at the best ways of cutting up rods of length i for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. Because an optimal solution to the length-n problem includes just one of these subproblem solutions (after cutting off the ûrst piece), independence of subproblems is not an issue. Overlapping subproblems The second ingredient that an optimization problem must have for dynamic pro- gramming to apply is that the space of subproblems must be <small= in the sense that a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblems over and over, rather than always generating new subproblems. Typically, the total number of distinct subproblems is a polynomial in the input size. When a recursive algo- rithm revisits the same problem repeatedly, we say that the optimization problem has overlapping subproblems. 6 In contrast, a problem for which a divide-and- 6 It may seem strange that dynamic programming relies on subproblems being both independent and overlapping. Although these requirements may sound contradictory, they describe two different notions, rather than two points on the same axis. Two subproblems of the same problem are inde- pendent if they do not share resources. Two subproblems are overlapping if they are really the same subproblem that occurs as a subproblem of different problems. 388 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 1,4 1,1 2,4 1,2 3,4 1,3 4,4 2,2 3,4 2,3 4,4 1,1 2,2 3,3 4,4 1,1 2,3 1,2 3,3 3,3 4,4 2,2 3,3 2,2 3,3 1,1 2,2 Figure 14.7 The recursion tree for the computation of R ECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN.p; 1; 4/. Each node contains the parameters i and j . The computations performed in a subtree shaded blue are replaced by a single table lookup in M EMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN. conquer approach is suitable usually generates brand-new problems at each step of the recursion. Dynamic-programming algorithms typically take advantage of overlapping subproblems by solving each subproblem once and then storing the solution in a table where it can be looked up when needed, using constant time per lookup. In Section 14.1, we brieüy examined how a recursive solution to rod cutting makes exponentially many calls to ûnd solutions of smaller subproblems. The dynamic-programming solution reduces the running time from the exponential time of the recursive algorithm down to quadratic time. To illustrate the overlapping-subproblems property in greater detail, let’s revisit the matrix-chain multiplication problem. Referring back to Figure 14.5, observe that MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER repeatedly looks up the solution to subproblems in lower rows when solving subproblems in higher rows. For example, it references entry mŒ3; 4� four times: during the computations of mŒ2; 4�, mŒ1; 4�, mŒ3; 5�, and mŒ3; 6�. If the algorithm were to recompute mŒ3; 4� each time, rather than just looking it up, the running time would increase dramatically. To see how, con- sider the inefûcient recursive procedure R ECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN on the fac- ing page, which determines mŒi; j �, the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the matrix-chain product A i Wj D A i A i C1    A j . The procedure is based directly on the recurrence (14.7). Figure 14.7 shows the recursion tree produced by the call RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN.p; 1; 4/. Each node is labeled by the values of the parameters i and j . Observe that some pairs of values occur many times. In fact, the time to compute mŒ1; n� by this recursive procedure is at least expo- nential in n. To see why, let T .n/ denote the time taken by RECURSIVE-MATRIX- 14.3 Elements of dynamic programming 389 RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN .p; i; j / 1 if i == j 2 return 0 3 mŒi; j � D 1 4 for k D i to j  1 5 q D RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN .p; i; k/ C RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN .p; k C 1; j / C p i 1 p k p j 6 if q < mŒi; j � 7 mŒi; j � D q 8 return mŒi; j � CHAIN to compute an optimal parenthesization of a chain of n matrices. Because the execution of lines 132 and of lines 637 each take at least unit time, as does the multiplication in line 5, inspection of the procedure yields the recurrence T .n/  Ĩ 1 if n D 1 ; 1 C n1 X kD1 .T .k/ C T .n  k/ C 1/ if n > 1 : Noting that for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1, each term T .i / appears once as T .k/ and once as T .n  k/, and collecting the n  1 1s in the summation together with the 1 out front, we can rewrite the recurrence as T .n/  2 n1 X i D1 T .i / C n : (14.8) Let’s prove that T .n/ D �.2 n / using the substitution method. Speciûcally, we’ll show that T .n/  2 n1 for all n  1. For the base case n D 1, the summation is empty, and we get T .1/  1 D 2 0 . Inductively, for n  2 we have T .n/  2 n1 X i D1 2 i 1 C n D 2 n2 X j D0 2 j C n (letting j D i  1) D 2.2 n1  1/ C n (by equation (A.6) on page 1142) D 2 n  2 C n  2 n1 ; 390 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming which completes the proof. Thus, the total amount of work performed by the call RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN .p; 1; n/ is at least exponential in n. Compare this top-down, recursive algorithm (without memoization) with the bottom-up dynamic-programming algorithm. The latter is more efûcient because it takes advantage of the overlapping-subproblems property. Matrix-chain multipli- cation has only ‚.n 2 / distinct subproblems, and the dynamic-programming algo- rithm solves each exactly once. The recursive algorithm, on the other hand, must solve each subproblem every time it reappears in the recursion tree. Whenever a recursion tree for the natural recursive solution to a problem contains the same sub- problem repeatedly, and the total number of distinct subproblems is small, dynamic programming can improve efûciency, sometimes dramatically. Reconstructing an optimal solution As a practical matter, you’ll often want to store in a separate table which choice you made in each subproblem so that you do not have to reconstruct this information from the table of costs. For matrix-chain multiplication, the table sŒi; j � saves a signiûcant amount of work when we need to reconstruct an optimal solution. Suppose that the M ATRIX- CHAIN-ORDER procedure on page 378 did not maintain the sŒi; j � table, so that it ûlled in only the table mŒi; j � containing optimal subproblem costs. The procedure chooses from among j  i possibilities when determining which subproblems to use in an optimal solution to parenthesizing A i A i C1    A j , and j  i is not a con- stant. Therefore, it would take ‚.j i / D !.1/ time to reconstruct which subprob- lems it chose for a solution to a given problem. Because M ATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER stores in sŒi; j � the index of the matrix at which it split the product A i A i C1    A j , the PRINT-OPTIMAL-PARENS procedure on page 381 can look up each choice in O.1/ time. Memoization As we saw for the rod-cutting problem, there is an alternative approach to dy- namic programming that often offers the efûciency of the bottom-up dynamic- programming approach while maintaining a top-down strategy. The idea is to memoize the natural, but inefûcient, recursive algorithm. As in the bottom-up ap- proach, you maintain a table with subproblem solutions, but the control structure for ûlling in the table is more like the recursive algorithm. A memoized recursive algorithm maintains an entry in a table for the solution to each subproblem. Each table entry initially contains a special value to indicate that the entry has yet to be ûlled in. When the subproblem is ûrst encountered as the recursive algorithm unfolds, its solution is computed and then stored in the table. 14.3 Elements of dynamic programming 391 Each subsequent encounter of this subproblem simply looks up the value stored in the table and returns it. 7 The procedure MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN is a memoized version of the pro- cedure RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN on page 389. Note where it resembles the memoized top-down method on page 369 for the rod-cutting problem. MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN .p; n/ 1 let mŒ1 W n; 1 W n� be a new table 2 for i D 1 to n 3 for j D i to n 4 mŒi; j � D 1 5 return LOOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; 1; n/ LOOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; i; j / 1 if mŒi; j � < 1 2 return mŒi; j � 3 if i == j 4 mŒi; j � D 0 5 else for k D i to j  1 6 q D LOOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; i; k/ C LOOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; k C 1; j / C p i 1 p k p j 7 if q < mŒi; j � 8 mŒi; j � D q 9 return mŒi; j � The MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN procedure, like the bottom-up MATRIX- CHAIN-ORDER procedure on page 378, maintains a table mŒ1 W n; 1 W n� of com- puted values of mŒi; j �, the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the matrix A i Wj . Each table entry initially contains the value 1 to indicate that the entry has yet to be ûlled in. Upon calling L OOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; i; j /, if line 1 ûnds that mŒi; j � < 1, then the procedure simply returns the pre- viously computed cost mŒi; j � in line 2. Otherwise, the cost is computed as in RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN, stored in mŒi; j �, and returned. Thus, LOOKUP-CHAIN.m; p; i; j / always returns the value of mŒi; j �, but it computes it only upon the ûrst call of LOOKUP-CHAIN with these speciûc values of i and j . 7 This approach presupposes that you know the set of all possible subproblem parameters and that you have established the relationship between table positions and subproblems. Another, more gen- eral, approach is to memoize by using hashing with the subproblem parameters as keys. 392 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming Figure 14.7 illustrates how MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN saves time compared with RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN. Subtrees shaded blue represent values that are looked up rather than recomputed. Like the bottom-up procedure MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER, the memoized proce- dure MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN runs in O.n 3 / time. To begin with, line 4 of MEMOIZED-MATRIX-CHAIN executes ‚.n 2 / times, which dominates the running time outside of the call to LOOKUP-CHAIN in line 5. We can categorize the calls of LOOKUP-CHAIN into two types: 1. calls in which mŒi; j � D 1, so that lines 339 execute, and 2. calls in which mŒi; j � < 1, so that LOOKUP-CHAIN simply returns in line 2. There are ‚.n 2 / calls of the ûrst type, one per table entry. All calls of the sec- ond type are made as recursive calls by calls of the ûrst type. Whenever a given call of LOOKUP-CHAIN makes recursive calls, it makes O.n/ of them. There- fore, there are O.n 3 / calls of the second type in all. Each call of the second type takes O.1/ time, and each call of the ûrst type takes O.n/ time plus the time spent in its recursive calls. The total time, therefore, is O.n 3 /. Memoization thus turns an �.2 n /-time algorithm into an O.n 3 /-time algorithm. We have seen how to solve the matrix-chain multiplication problem by either a top-down, memoized dynamic-programming algorithm or a bottom-up dynamic- programming algorithm in O.n 3 / time. Both the bottom-up and memoized meth- ods take advantage of the overlapping-subproblems property. There are only ‚.n 2 / distinct subproblems in total, and either of these methods computes the solution to each subproblem only once. Without memoization, the natural recursive algorithm runs in exponential time, since solved subproblems are repeatedly solved. In general practice, if all subproblems must be solved at least once, a bottom-up dynamic-programming algorithm usually outperforms the corresponding top-down memoized algorithm by a constant factor, because the bottom-up algorithm has no overhead for recursion and less overhead for maintaining the table. Moreover, for some problems you can exploit the regular pattern of table accesses in the dynamic- programming algorithm to reduce time or space requirements even further. On the other hand, in certain situations, some of the subproblems in the subproblem space might not need to be solved at all. In that case, the memoized solution has the advantage of solving only those subproblems that are deûnitely required. Exercises 14.3-1 Which is a more efûcient way to determine the optimal number of multiplications in a matrix-chain multiplication problem: enumerating all the ways of parenthesiz- 14.4 Longest common subsequence 393 ing the product and computing the number of multiplications for each, or running RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN? Justify your answer. 14.3-2 Draw the recursion tree for the MERGE-SORT procedure from Section 2.3.1 on an array of 16 elements. Explain why memoization fails to speed up a good divide- and-conquer algorithm such as M ERGE-SORT. 14.3-3 Consider the antithetical variant of the matrix-chain multiplication problem where the goal is to parenthesize the sequence of matrices so as to maximize, rather than minimize, the number of scalar multiplications. Does this problem exhibit optimal substructure? 14.3-4 As stated, in dynamic programming, you ûrst solve the subproblems and then choose which of them to use in an optimal solution to the problem. Professor Capulet claims that she does not always need to solve all the subproblems in or- der to ûnd an optimal solution. She suggests that she can ûnd an optimal solution to the matrix-chain multiplication problem by always choosing the matrix A k at which to split the subproduct A i A i C1    A j (by selecting k to minimize the quan- tity p i 1 p k p j ) before solving the subproblems. Find an instance of the matrix- chain multiplication problem for which this greedy approach yields a suboptimal solution. 14.3-5 Suppose that the rod-cutting problem of Section 14.1 also had a limit l i on the number of pieces of length i allowed to be produced, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Show that the optimal-substructure property described in Section 14.1 no longer holds. 14.4 Longest common subsequence Biological applications often need to compare the DNA of two (or more) dif- ferent organisms. A strand of DNA consists of a string of molecules called bases, where the possible bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Representing each of these bases by its initial letter, we can express a strand of DNA as a string over the 4-element set fA; C; G; Tg. (See Section C.1 for the deûnition of a string.) For example, the DNA of one organism may be S 1 D ACCGGTCGAGTGCGCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA , and the DNA of another organ- ism may be S 2 D GTCGTTCGGAATGCCGTTGCTCTGTAAA . One reason to com- 394 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming pare two strands of DNA is to determine how <similar= the two strands are, as some measure of how closely related the two organisms are. We can, and do, deûne sim- ilarity in many different ways. For example, we can say that two DNA strands are similar if one is a substring of the other. (Chapter 32 explores algorithms to solve this problem.) In our example, neither S 1 nor S 2 is a substring of the other. Alter- natively, we could say that two strands are similar if the number of changes needed to turn one into the other is small. (Problem 14-5 looks at this notion.) Yet another way to measure the similarity of strands S 1 and S 2 is by ûnding a third strand S 3 in which the bases in S 3 appear in each of S 1 and S 2 . These bases must appear in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. The longer the strand S 3 we can ûnd, the more similar S 1 and S 2 are. In our example, the longest strand S 3 is GTCGTCGGAAGCCGGCCGAA . We formalize this last notion of similarity as the longest-common-subsequence problem. A subsequence of a given sequence is just the given sequence with 0 or more elements left out. Formally, given a sequence X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i, another sequence Z D h´ 1 ; ´ 2 ; : : : ; ´ k i is a subsequence of X if there exists a strictly increasing sequence hi 1 ; i 2 ; : : : ; i k i of indices of X such that for all j D 1; 2; : : : ; k, we have x i j D ´ j . For example, Z D hB; C; D; B i is a subsequence of X D hA; B; C; B; D; A; B i with corresponding index sequence h2; 3; 5; 7i. Given two sequences X and Y , we say that a sequence Z is a common sub- sequence of X and Y if Z is a subsequence of both X and Y . For example, if X D hA; B; C; B; D; A; B i and Y D hB; D; C; A; B; Ai, the sequence hB; C; Ai is a common subsequence of both X and Y . The sequence hB; C; Ai is not a longest common subsequence (LCS) of X and Y , however, since it has length 3 and the sequence hB; C; B; Ai, which is also common to both sequences X and Y , has length 4. The sequence hB; C; B; Ai is an LCS of X and Y , as is the sequence hB; D; A; B i, since X and Y have no common subsequence of length 5 or greater. In the longest-common-subsequence problem, the input is two sequences X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i and Y D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i, and the goal is to ûnd a maximum- length common subsequence of X and Y . This section shows how to efûciently solve the LCS problem using dynamic programming. Step 1: Characterizing a longest common subsequence You can solve the LCS problem with a brute-force approach: enumerate all subse- quences of X and check each subsequence to see whether it is also a subsequence of Y , keeping track of the longest subsequence you ûnd. Each subsequence of X corresponds to a subset of the indices f1; 2; : : : ; mg of X . Because X has 2 m sub- sequences, this approach requires exponential time, making it impractical for long sequences. 14.4 Longest common subsequence 395 The LCS problem has an optimal-substructure property, however, as the fol- lowing theorem shows. As we’ll see, the natural classes of subproblems corre- spond to pairs of <preûxes= of the two input sequences. To be precise, given a sequence X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i, we deûne the i th preûx of X , for i D 0; 1; : : : ; m, as X i D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x i i. For example, if X D hA; B; C; B; D; A; B i, then X 4 D hA; B; C; B i and X 0 is the empty sequence. Theorem 14.1 (Optimal substructure of an LCS) Let X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i and Y D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i be sequences, and let Z D h´ 1 ; ´ 2 ; : : : ; ´ k i be any LCS of X and Y . 1. If x m D y n , then ´ k D x m D y n and Z k1 is an LCS of X m1 and Y n1 . 2. If x m ¤ y n and ´ k ¤ x m , then Z is an LCS of X m1 and Y . 3. If x m ¤ y n and ´ k ¤ y n , then Z is an LCS of X and Y n1 . Proof (1) If ´ k ¤ x m , then we could append x m D y n to Z to obtain a common subsequence of X and Y of length k C 1, contradicting the supposition that Z is a longest common subsequence of X and Y . Thus, we must have ´ k D x m D y n . Now, the preûx Z k1 is a length-.k  1/ common subsequence of X m1 and Y n1 . We wish to show that it is an LCS. Suppose for the purpose of contradiction that there exists a common subsequence W of X m1 and Y n1 with length greater than k  1. Then, appending x m D y n to W produces a common subsequence of X and Y whose length is greater than k, which is a contradiction. (2) If ´ k ¤ x m , then Z is a common subsequence of X m1 and Y . If there were a common subsequence W of X m1 and Y with length greater than k, then W would also be a common subsequence of X m and Y , contradicting the assumption that Z is an LCS of X and Y . (3) The proof is symmetric to (2). The way that Theorem 14.1 characterizes longest common subsequences says that an LCS of two sequences contains within it an LCS of preûxes of the two se- quences. Thus, the LCS problem has an optimal-substructure property. A recursive solution also has the overlapping-subproblems property, as we’ll see in a moment. Step 2: A recursive solution Theorem 14.1 implies that you should examine either one or two subproblems when ûnding an LCS of X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i and Y D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i. If x m D y n , you need to ûnd an LCS of X m1 and Y n1 . Appending x m D y n to this LCS yields an LCS of X and Y . If x m ¤ y n , then you have to solve two subproblems: ûnding an LCS of X m1 and Y and ûnding an LCS of X and Y n1 . 396 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming Whichever of these two LCSs is longer is an LCS of X and Y . Because these cases exhaust all possibilities, one of the optimal subproblem solutions must appear within an LCS of X and Y . The LCS problem has the overlapping-subproblems property. Here’s how. To ûnd an LCS of X and Y , you might need to ûnd the LCSs of X and Y n1 and of X m1 and Y . But each of these subproblems has the subsubproblem of ûnding an LCS of X m1 and Y n1 . Many other subproblems share subsubproblems. As in the matrix-chain multiplication problem, solving the LCS problem recur- sively involves establishing a recurrence for the value of an optimal solution. Let’s deûne cŒi; j � to be the length of an LCS of the sequences X i and Y j . If either i D 0 or j D 0, one of the sequences has length 0, and so the LCS has length 0. The optimal substructure of the LCS problem gives the recursive formula cŒi; j � D Ĩ 0 if i D 0 or j D 0 ; cŒi  1; j  1� C 1 if i; j > 0 and x i D y j ; max fcŒi; j  1�; cŒi  1; j �g if i; j > 0 and x i ¤ y j : (14.9) In this recursive formulation, a condition in the problem restricts which sub- problems to consider. When x i D y j , you can and should consider the subproblem of ûnding an LCS of X i 1 and Y j 1 . Otherwise, you instead consider the two subproblems of ûnding an LCS of X i and Y j 1 and of X i 1 and Y j . In the pre- vious dynamic-programming algorithms we have examined4for rod cutting and matrix-chain multiplication4we didn’t rule out any subproblems due to conditions in the problem. Finding an LCS is not the only dynamic-programming algorithm that rules out subproblems based on conditions in the problem. For example, the edit-distance problem (see Problem 14-5) has this characteristic. Step 3: Computing the length of an LCS Based on equation (14.9), you could write an exponential-time recursive algorithm to compute the length of an LCS of two sequences. Since the LCS problem has only ‚.mn/ distinct subproblems (computing cŒi; j � for 0 හ i හ m and 0 හ j හ n), dynamic programming can compute the solutions bottom up. The procedure LC S-LENGTH on the next page takes two sequences X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i and Y D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i as inputs, along with their lengths. It stores the cŒi; j � values in a table cŒ0 W m; 0 W n�, and it computes the entries in row- major order. That is, the procedure ûlls in the ûrst row of c from left to right, then the second row, and so on. The procedure also maintains the table bŒ1 W m; 1 W n� to help in constructing an optimal solution. Intuitively, bŒi; j � points to the table entry corresponding to the optimal subproblem solution chosen when computing cŒi; j �. The procedure returns the b and c tables, where cŒm; n� contains the length of an LCS of X and Y . Figure 14.8 shows the tables produced by LC S-LENGTH on the 14.4 Longest common subsequence 397 sequences X D hA; B; C; B; D; A; B i and Y D hB; D; C; A; B; Ai. The running time of the procedure is ‚.mn/, since each table entry takes ‚.1/ time to compute.

Begin at bŒm; n� and trace through the table by following the arrows. Each <-= encountered in an entry bŒi; j � im- plies that x i D y j is an element of the LCS that LCS-LENGTH found. This method gives you the elements of this LCS in reverse order. The recursive pro- cedure PRINT-LCS prints out an LCS of X and Y in the proper, forward order. 398 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 1 1 2 2 2 0 1 1 2 2 3 0 1 2 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 2 3 3 0 1 2 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 4 B D C A B A 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 A B B D A B 1 2 4 5 6 7 0 j i x i y j Figure 14.8 The c and b tables computed by LC S-LENGTH on the sequences X D hA; B; C; B; D; A; Bi and Y D hB; D; C; A; B; Ai. The square in row i and column j contains the value of cŒi; j � and the appropriate arrow for the value of bŒi; j �. The entry 4 in cŒ7; 6�4the lower right-hand corner of the table4is the length of an LCS hB; C; B; Ai of X and Y . For i; j > 0, entry cŒi; j � depends only on whether x i D y j and the values in entries cŒi  1; j �, cŒi; j  1�, and cŒi  1; j  1�, which are computed before cŒi; j �. To reconstruct the elements of an LCS, follow the bŒi; j � arrows from the lower right-hand corner, as shown by the sequence shaded blue. Each <-= on the shaded-blue sequence corresponds to an entry (highlighted) for which x i D y j is a member of an LCS. The initial call is PRINT-LCS.b; X; m; n/. For the b table in Figure 14.8, this pro- cedure prints BCBA. The procedure takes O.m C n/ time, since it decrements at least one of i and j in each recursive call. Improving the code Once you have developed an algorithm, you will often ûnd that you can improve on the time or space it uses. Some changes can simplify the code and improve constant factors but otherwise yield no asymptotic improvement in performance. Others can yield substantial asymptotic savings in time and space. In the LCS algorithm, for example, you can eliminate the b table altogether. Each cŒi; j � entry depends on only three other c table entries: cŒi  1; j  1�, cŒi  1; j �, and cŒi; j  1�. Given the value of cŒi; j �, you can determine in O.1/ time which of these three values was used to compute cŒi; j �, without inspecting table b. Thus, you can reconstruct an LCS in O.mCn/ time using a procedure sim- ilar to PRINT-LC S. (Exercise 14.4-2 asks you to give the pseudocode.) Alt hough this method saves ‚.mn/ space, the auxiliary space requirement for computing 14.4 Longest common subsequence 399 an LCS does not asymptotically decrease, since the c table takes ‚.mn/ space anyway. You can, however, reduce the asymptotic space requirements for LCS-LENGTH, since it needs only two rows of table c at a time: the row being computed and the previous row. (In fact, as Exercise 14.4-4 asks you to show, you can use only slightly more than the space for one row of c to compute the length of an LCS.) This improvement works if you need only the length of an LCS. If you need to reconstruct the elements of an LCS, the smaller table does not keep enough information to retrace the algorithm’s steps in O.m C n/ time. Exercises 14.4-1 Determine an LCS of h1; 0; 0; 1; 0; 1; 0; 1i and h0; 1; 0; 1; 1; 0; 1; 1; 0i. 14.4-2 Give pseudocode to reconstruct an LCS from the completed c table and the original sequences X D hx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m i and Y D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y n i in O.m C n/ time, without using the b table. 14.4-3 Give a memoized version of LC S-LENGTH that runs in O.mn/ time. 14.4-4 Show how to compute the length of an LCS using only 2  min fm; ng entries in the c table plus O.1/ additional space. Then show how to do the same thing, but using min fm; ng entries plus O.1/ additional space. 14.4-5 Give an O.n 2 /-time algorithm to ûnd the longest monotonically increasing subse- quence of a sequence of n numbers. ? 14.4-6 Give an O.n lg n/-time algorithm to ûnd the longest monotonically increasing sub- sequence of a sequence of n numbers. (Hint: The last element of a candidate subse- quence of length i is at least as large as the last element of a candidate subsequence of length i  1. Maintain candidate subsequences by linking them through the input sequence.) 400 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 14.5 Optimal binary search trees Suppose that you are designing a program to translate text from English to Latvian. For each occurrence of each English word in the text, you need to look up its Latvian equivalent. You can perform these lookup operations by building a binary search tree with n English words as keys and their Latvian equivalents as satellite data. Because you will search the tree for each individual word in the text, you want the total time spent searching to be as low as possible. You can ensure an O.lg n/ search time per occurrence by using a red-black tree or any other balanced binary search tree. Words appear with different frequencies, however, and a frequently used word such as the can end up appearing far from the root while a rarely used word such as naumachia appears near the root. Such an organization would slow down the translation, since the number of nodes visited when searching for a key in a binary search tree equals 1 plus the depth of the node containing the key. You want words that occur frequently in the text to be placed nearer the root. 8 Moreover, some words in the text might have no Latvian translation, 9 and such words would not appear in the binary search tree at all. How can you organize a binary search tree so as to minimize the number of nodes visited in all searches, given that you know how often each word occurs? What you need is an optimal binary search tree. Formally, given a sequence K D hk 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k n i of n distinct keys such that k 1 < k 2 <    < k n , build a binary search tree containing them. For each key k i , you are given the probabil- ity p i that any given search is for key k i . Since some searches may be for values not in K, you also have n C 1 <dummy= keys d 0 ; d 1 ; d 2 ; : : : ; d n representing those values. In particular, d 0 represents all values less than k 1 , d n represents all val- ues greater than k n , and for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1, the dummy key d i represents all values between k i and k i C1 . For each dummy key d i , you have the probability q i that a search corresponds to d i . Figure 14.9 shows two binary search trees for a set of n D 5 keys. Each key k i is an internal node, and each dummy key d i is a leaf. Since every search is either successful (ûnding some key k i ) or unsuccessful (ûnding some dummy key d i ), we have n X i D1 p i C n X i D0 q i D 1 : (14.10) 8 If the subject of the text is ancient Rome, you might want naumachia to appear near the root. 9 Yes, naumachia has a Latvian counterpart: nomaˇ cija. 14.5 Optimal binary search trees 401 k 2 k 1 k 4 k 3 k 5 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 k 2 k 1 k 4 k 3 k 5 d 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 node depth probability contribution k 1 1 0.15 0.30 k 2 0 0.10 0.10 k 3 2 0.05 0.15 k 4 1 0.10 0.20 k 5 2 0.20 0.60 d 0 2 0.05 0.15 d 1 2 0.10 0.30 d 2 3 0.05 0.20 d 3 3 0.05 0.20 d 4 3 0.05 0.20 d 5 3 0.10 0.40 Total 2.80 (a) node depth probability contribution k 1 1 0.15 0.30 k 2 0 0.10 0.10 k 3 3 0.05 0.20 k 4 2 0.10 0.30 k 5 1 0.20 0.40 d 0 2 0.05 0.15 d 1 2 0.10 0.30 d 2 4 0.05 0.25 d 3 4 0.05 0.25 d 4 3 0.05 0.20 d 5 2 0.10 0.30 Total 2.75 (b) Figure 14.9 Two binary search trees for a set of n D 5 keys with the following probabilities: i 0 1 2 3 4 5 p i 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.10 0.20 q i 0.05 0.10 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.10 (a) A binary search tree with expected search cost 2.80. (b) A binary search tree with expected search cost 2.75. This tree is optimal. Knowing the probabilities of searches for each key and each dummy key allows us to determine the expected cost of a search in a given binary search tree T . Let us assume that the actual cost of a search equals the number of nodes examined, which is the depth of the node found by the search in T , plus 1. Then the expected cost of a search in T is E Œsearch cost in T � D n X i D1 .depth T .k i / C 1/  p i C n X i D0 .depth T .d i / C 1/  q i D 1 C n X i D1 depth T .k i /  p i C n X i D0 depth T .d i /  q i ; (14.11) 402 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming where depth T denotes a node’s depth in the tree T . The last equation follows from equation (14.10). Figure 14.9 shows how to calculate the expected search cost node by node. For a given set of probabilities, your goal is to construct a binary search tree whose expected search cost is smallest. We call such a tree an optimal binary search tree. Figure 14.9(a) shows one binary search tree, with expected cost 2:80, for the probabilities given in the ûgure caption. Part (b) of the ûgure displays an optimal binary search tree, with expected cost 2:75. This example demonstrates that an optimal binary search tree is not necessarily a tree whose overall height is smallest. Nor does an optimal binary search tree always have the key with the greatest probability at the root. Here, key k 5 has the greatest search probability of any key, yet the root of the optimal binary search tree shown is k 2 . (The lowest expected cost of any binary search tree with k 5 at the root is 2.85.) As with matrix-chain multiplication, exhaustive checking of all possibilities fails to yield an efûcient algorithm. You can label the nodes of any n-node binary tree with the keys k 1 ; k 2 ; : : : ; k n to construct a binary search tree, and then add in the dummy keys as leaves. In Problem 12-4 on page 329, we saw that the number of binary trees with n nodes is �.4 n =n 3=2 /. Thus you would need to examine an exponential number of binary search trees to perform an exhaustive search. We’ll see how to solve this problem more efûciently with dynamic programming. Step 1: The structure of an optimal binary search tree To characterize the optimal substructure of optimal binary search trees, we start with an observation about subtrees. Consider any subtree of a binary search tree. It must contain keys in a contiguous range k i ; : : : ; k j , for some 1 හ i හ j හ n. In addition, a subtree that contains keys k i ; : : : ; k j must also have as its leaves the dummy keys d i 1 ; : : : ; d j . Now we can state the optimal substructure: if an optimal binary search tree T has a subtree T 0 containing keys k i ; : : : ; k j , then this subtree T 0 must be optimal as well for the subproblem with keys k i ; : : : ; k j and dummy keys d i 1 ; : : : ; d j . The usual cut-and-paste argument applies. If there were a subtree T 00 whose expected cost is lower than that of T 0 , then cutting T 0 out of T and pasting in T 00 would result in a binary search tree of lower expected cost than T , thus contradicting the optimality of T . With the optimal substructure in hand, here is how to construct an optimal solu- tion to the problem from optimal solutions to subproblems. Given keys k i ; : : : ; k j , one of these keys, say k r (i හ r හ j ), is the root of an optimal subtree contain- ing these keys. The left subtree of the root k r contains the keys k i ; : : : ; k r 1 (and dummy keys d i 1 ; : : : ; d r 1 ), and the right subtree contains the keys k r C1 ; : : : ; k j (and dummy keys d r ; : : : ; d j ). As long as you examine all candidate roots k r , 14.5 Optimal binary search trees 403 where i හ r හ j , and you determine all optimal binary search trees contain- ing k i ; : : : ; k r 1 and those containing k r C1 ; : : : ; k j , you are guaranteed to ûnd an optimal binary search tree. There is one technical detail worth understanding about <empty= subtrees. Sup- pose that in a subtree with keys k i ; : : : ; k j , you select k i as the root. By the above argument, k i ’s left subtree contains the keys k i ; : : : ; k i 1 : no keys at all. Bear in mind, however, that subtrees also contain dummy keys. We adopt the convention that a subtree containing keys k i ; : : : ; k i 1 has no actual keys but does contain the single dummy key d i 1 . Symmetrically, if you select k j as the root, then k j ’s right subtree contains the keys k j C1 ; : : : ; k j . This right subtree contains no actual keys, but it does contain the dummy key d j . Step 2: A recursive solution To deûne the value of an optimal solution recursively, the subproblem domain is ûnding an optimal binary search tree containing the keys k i ; : : : ; k j , where i  1, j හ n, and j  i  1. (When j D i  1, there is just the dummy key d i 1 , but no actual keys.) Let eŒi; j � denote the expected cost of searching an optimal binary search tree containing the keys k i ; : : : ; k j . Your goal is to compute eŒ1; n�, the expected cost of searching an optimal binary search tree for all the actual and dummy keys. The easy case occurs when j D i  1. Then the subproblem consists of just the dummy key d i 1 . The expected search cost is eŒi; i  1� D q i 1 . When j  i , you need to select a root k r from among k i ; : : : ; k j and then make an optimal binary search tree with keys k i ; : : : ; k r 1 as its left subtree and an optimal binary search tree with keys k r C1 ; : : : ; k j as its right subtree. What happens to the expected search cost of a subtree when it becomes a subtree of a node? The depth of each node in the subtree increases by 1. By equation (14.11), the expected search cost of this subtree increases by the sum of all the probabilities in the subtree. For a subtree with keys k i ; : : : ; k j , denote this sum of probabilities as w.i; j / D j X l Di p l C j X l Di 1 q l : (14.12) Thus, if k r is the root of an optimal subtree containing keys k i ; : : : ; k j , we have eŒi; j � D p r C .eŒi; r  1� C w.i; r  1// C .eŒr C 1; j � C w.r C 1; j // : Noting that w.i; j / D w.i; r  1/ C p r C w.r C 1; j / ; we rewrite eŒi; j � as 404 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming eŒi; j � D eŒi; r  1� C eŒr C 1; j � C w.i; j / : (14.13) The recursive equation (14.13) assumes that you know which node k r to use as the root. Of course, you choose the root that gives the lowest expected search cost, giving the ûnal recursive formulation: eŒi; j � D ( q i 1 if j D i  1 ; min feŒi; r  1� C eŒr C 1; j � C w.i; j / W i හ r හ j g if i හ j : (14.14) The eŒi; j � values give the expected search costs in optimal binary search trees. To help keep track of the structure of optimal binary search trees, deûne root Œi; j �, for 1 හ i හ j හ n, to be the index r for which k r is the root of an optimal binary search tree containing keys k i ; : : : ; k j . Although we’ll see how to compute the values of root Œi; j �, the construction of an optimal binary search tree from these values is left as Exercise 14.5-1. Step 3: Computing the expected search cost of an optimal binary search tree At this point, you may have noticed some similarities between our characterizations of optimal binary search trees and matrix-chain multiplication. For both problem domains, the subproblems consist of contiguous index subranges. A direct, recur- sive implementation of equation (14.14) would be just as inefûcient as a direct, recursive matrix-chain multiplication algorithm. Instead, you can store the eŒi; j � values in a table eŒ1 W n C 1; 0 W n�. The ûrst index needs to run to n C 1 rather than n because in order to have a subtree containing only the dummy key d n , you need to compute and store eŒn C 1; n�. The second index needs to start from 0 because in order to have a subtree containing only the dummy key d 0 , you need to compute and store eŒ1; 0�. Only the entries eŒi; j � for which j  i  1 are ûlled in. The table root Œi; j � records the root of the subtree containing keys k i ; : : : ; k j and uses only the entries for which 1 හ i හ j හ n. One other table makes the dynamic-programming algorithm a little faster. In- stead of computing the value of w.i; j / from scratch every time you compute eŒi; j �, which would take ‚.j  i / additions, store these values in a table wŒ1 W n C 1; 0 W n�. For the base case, compute wŒi; i  1� D q i 1 for 1 හ i හ n C 1. For j  i , compute wŒi; j � D wŒi; j  1� C p j C q j : (14.15) Thus, you can compute the ‚.n 2 / values of wŒi; j � in ‚.1/ time each. The OPTIMAL-BST procedure on the next page takes as inputs the probabilities p 1 ; : : : ; p n and q 0 ; : : : ; q n and the size n, and it returns the tables e and root . From the description above and the similarity to the MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER procedure 14.5 Optimal binary search trees 405 in Section 14.2, you should ûnd the operation of this procedure to be fairly straight- forward. The for loop of lines 234 initializes the values of eŒi; i  1� and wŒi; i  1�. Then the for loop of lines 5314 uses the recurrences (14.14) and (14.15) to com- pute eŒi; j � and wŒi; j � for all 1 හ i හ j හ n. In the ûrst iteration, when l D 1, the loop computes eŒi; i � and wŒi; i � for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The second iteration, with l D 2, computes eŒi; i C 1� and wŒi; i C 1� for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1, and so on. The innermost for loop, in lines 10314, tries each candidate index r to determine which key k r to use as the root of an optimal binary search tree containing keys k i ; : : : ; k j . This for loop saves the current value of the index r in root Œi; j � whenever it ûnds a better key to use as the root.

As in the matrix-chain multiplication example of Figure 14.5, the tables are rotated to make the diagonals run horizontally. OPTIMAL-BST computes the rows from bottom to top and from left to right within each row. The OPTIMAL-BST procedure takes ‚.n 3 / time, just like MATRIX-CHAIN- ORDER. Its running time is O.n 3 /, since its for loops are nested three deep and each loop index takes on at most n values. The loop indices in OPTIMAL-BST do not have exactly the same bounds as those in M ATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER, but they are within at most 1 in all directions. Thus, like MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER, the OPTIMAL-BST procedure takes �.n 3 / time. 406 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming 2.75 1.75 1.25 0.90 0.45 0.05 2.00 1.20 0.70 0.40 0.10 1.30 0.60 0.25 0.05 0.90 0.30 0.05 0.50 0.05 0.10 e 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 j i 1.00 0.70 0.55 0.45 0.30 0.05 0.80 0.50 0.35 0.25 0.10 0.60 0.30 0.15 0.05 0.50 0.20 0.05 0.35 0.05 0.10 w 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 j i 2 2 2 1 1 4 2 2 2 5 4 3 5 4 5 root 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 j i Figure 14.10 The tables eŒi; j �, wŒi; j �, and rootŒi; j � computed by OPTIMAL-BST on the key distribution shown in Figure 14.9.

How would this change affect the asymptotic running time of OPTIMAL-BST? ? 14.5-4 Knuth [264] has shown that there are always roots of optimal subtrees such that root Œi; j  1� හ root Œi; j � හ root Œi C 1; j � for all 1 හ i < j හ n. Use this fact to modify the OPTIMAL-BST procedure to run in ‚.n 2 / time. Problems 14-1 Longest simple path in a directed acyclic graph You are given a directed acyclic graph G D .V; E/ with real-valued edge weights and two distinguished vertices s and t . The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of the edges in the path. Describe a dynamic-programming approach for ûnding a longest weighted simple path from s to t . What is the running time of your algorithm? 14-2 Longest palindrome subsequence A palindrome is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the same for- ward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length 1, civic, racecar, and aibohphobia (fear of palindromes). Give an efûcient algorithm to ûnd the longest palindrome that is a subsequence of a given input string. For example, given the input character, your algorithm should return carac. What is the running time of your algorithm? 14-3 Bitonic euclidean traveling-salesperson problem In the euclidean traveling-salesperson problem, you are given a set of n points in the plane, and your goal is to ûnd the shortest closed tour that connects all n points. 408 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming (a) (b) Figure 14.11 Seven points in the plane, shown on a unit grid. (a) The shortest closed tour, with length approximately 24:89. This tour is not bitonic. (b) The shortest bitonic tour for the same set of points. Its length is approximately 25:58. Figure 14.11(a) shows the solution to a 7-point problem. The general problem is NP-hard, and its solution is therefore believed to require more than polynomial time (see Chapter 34). J. L. Bentley has suggested simplifying the problem by considering only bitonic tours, that is, tours that start at the leftmost point, go strictly rightward to the right- most point, and then go strictly leftward back to the starting point. Figure 14.11(b) shows the shortest bitonic tour of the same 7 points. In this case, a polynomial-time algorithm is possible. Describe an O.n 2 /-time algorithm for determining an optimal bitonic tour. You may assume that no two points have the same x -coordinate and that all operations on real numbers take unit time. (Hint: Scan left to right, maintaining optimal pos- sibilities for the two parts of the tour.) 14-4 Printing neatly Consider the problem of neatly printing a paragraph with a monospaced font (all characters having the same width). The input text is a sequence of n words of lengths l 1 ; l 2 ; : : : ; l n , measured in characters, which are to be printed neatly on a number of lines that hold a maximum of M characters each. No word exceeds the line length, so that l i හ M for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The criterion of <neatness= is as follows. If a given line contains words i through j , where i හ j , and exactly one space appears between words, then the number of extra space characters at the end of the line is M  j C i  P j kDi l k , which must be nonnegative so that the words ût on the line. The goal is to minimize the sum, over all lines except the last, of the cubes of the numbers of extra space characters at the ends of lines. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to print a paragraph of n words neatly. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm. Problems for Chapter 14 409 14-5 Edit distance In order to transform a source string of text xŒ1 W m� to a target string yŒ1 W n�, you can perform various transformation operations. The goal is, given x and y , to produce a series of transformations that changes x to y . An array ´4assumed to be large enough to hold all the characters it needs4holds the intermediate re- sults. Initially, ´ is empty, and at termination, you should have ´Œj � D yŒj � for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The procedure for solving this problem maintains current indices i into x and j into ´, and the operations are allowed to alter ´ and these indices. Initially, i D j D 1. Every character in x must be examined during the transfor- mation, which means that at the end of the sequence of transformation operations, i D m C 1. You may choose from among six transformation operations, each of which has a constant cost that depends on the operation: Copy a character from x to ´ by setting ´Œj � D xŒi � and then incrementing both i and j . This operation examines xŒi � and has cost Q C . Replace a character from x by another character c , by setting ´Œj � D c , and then incrementing both i and j . This operation examines xŒi � and has cost Q R . Delete a character from x by incrementing i but leaving j alone. This operation examines xŒi � and has cost Q D . Insert the character c into ´ by setting ´Œj � D c and then incrementing j , but leaving i alone. This operation examines no characters of x and has cost Q I . Twiddle (i.e., exchange) the next two characters by copying them from x to ´ but in the opposite order: setting ´Œj � D xŒi C 1� and ´Œj C 1� D xŒi �, and then setting i D i C 2 and j D j C 2. This operation examines xŒi � and xŒi C 1� and has cost Q T . Kill the remainder of x by setting i D m C 1. This operation examines all char- acters in x that have not yet been examined. This operation, if performed, must be the ûnal operation. It has cost Q K . Figure 14.12 gives one way to transform the source string algorithm to the target string altruistic. Several other sequences of transformation operations can transform algorithm to altruistic. Assume that Q C < Q D C Q I and Q R < Q D C Q I , since otherwise, the copy and replace operations would not be used. The cost of a given sequence of transformation operations is the sum of the costs of the individual operations in the sequence. For the sequence above, the cost of transforming algorithm to altruistic is 3Q C C Q R C Q D C 4Q I C Q T C Q K . a. Given two sequences xŒ1 W m� and yŒ1 W n� and the costs of the transformation operations, the edit distance from x to y is the cost of the least expensive op- 410 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming Operation x ´ initial strings a lgorithm copy al gorithm a copy alg orithm al replace by t algo rithm alt delete algor ithm alt copy algori thm altr insert u algori thm altru insert i algori thm altrui insert s algori thm altruis twiddle algorith m altruisti insert c algorith m altruistic kill algorithm altruistic Figure 14.12 A sequence of operations that transforms the source algorithm to the target string altruistic.

Describe a dynamic-programming algorithm that ûnds the edit distance from xŒ1 W m� to yŒ1 W n� and prints an op- timal operation sequence. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm. The edit-distance problem generalizes the problem of aligning two DNA sequences (see, for example, Setubal and Meidanis [405, Section 3.2]). There are several methods for measuring the similarity of two DNA sequences by aligning them. One such method to align two sequences x and y consists of inserting spaces at arbitrary locations in the two sequences (including at either end) so that the result- ing sequences x 0 and y 0 have the same length but do not have a space in the same position (i.e., for no position j are both x 0 Œj � and y 0 Œj � a space). Then we assign a <score= to each position. Position j receives a score as follows:  C1 if x 0 Œj � D y 0 Œj � and neither is a space,  1 if x 0 Œj � ¤ y 0 Œj � and neither is a space,  2 if either x 0 Œj � or y 0 Œj � is a space. The score for the alignment is the sum of the scores of the individual positions. For example, given the sequences x D GATCGGCAT and y D CAATGTGAATC, one alignment is ATCG GCAT CAAT GTGAATC - * ++ * + * +-++ * Problems for Chapter 14 411 A + under a position indicates a score of C1 for that position, a - indicates a score of 1, and a * indicates a score of 2, so that this alignment has a total score of 6  1  2  1  4  2 D 4. b. Explain how to cast the problem of ûnding an optimal alignment as an edit- distance problem using a subset of the transformation operations copy, replace, delete, insert, twiddle, and kill. 14-6 Planning a company party Professor Blutarsky is consulting for the president of a corporation that is planning a company party. The company has a hierarchical structure, that is, the supervisor relation forms a tree rooted at the president. The human resources department has ranked each employee with a conviviality rating, which is a real number. In order to make the party fun for all attendees, the president does not want both an employee and his or her immediate supervisor to attend. Professor Blutarsky is given the tree that describes the structure of the corpo- ration, using the left-child, right-sibling representation described in Section 10.3. Each node of the tree holds, in addition to the pointers, the name of an employee and that employee’s conviviality ranking. Describe an algorithm to make up a guest list that maximizes the sum of the conviviality ratings of the guests. Analyze the running time of your algorithm. 14-7 Viterbi algorithm Dynamic programming on a directed graph can play a part in speech recogni- tion. A directed graph G D .V; E/ with labeled edges forms a formal model of a person speaking a restricted language. Each edge .u; v/ 2 E is labeled with a sound � .u; v/ from a ûnite set † of sounds. Each directed path in the graph starting from a distinguished vertex v 0 2 V corresponds to a possible sequence of sounds produced by the model, with the label of a path being the concatenation of the labels of the edges on that path. a. Describe an efûcient algorithm that, given an edge-labeled directed graph G with distinguished vertex v 0 and a sequence s D h� 1 ; � 2 ; : : : ; � k i of sounds from †, returns a path in G that begins at v 0 and has s as its label, if any such path exists. Otherwise, the algorithm should return NO- SUCH- PATH. Analyze the running time of your algorithm. (Hint: You may ûnd concepts from Chap- ter 20 useful.) Now suppose that every edge .u; v/ 2 E has an associated nonnegative probabil- ity p.u; v/ of being traversed, so that the corresponding sound is produced. The sum of the probabilities of the edges leaving any vertex equals 1. The probability of a path is deûned to be the product of the probabilities of its edges. Think of 412 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming the probability of a path beginning at vertex v 0 as the probability that a <random walk= beginning at v 0 follows the speciûed path, where the edge leaving a vertex u is taken randomly, according to the probabilities of the available edges leaving u. b. Extend your answer to part (a) so that if a path is returned, it is a most probable path starting at vertex v 0 and having label s . Analyze the running time of your algorithm. 14-8 Image compression by seam carving Suppose that you are given a color picture consisting of an mn array AŒ1 W m; 1 W n� of pixels, where each pixel speciûes a triple of red, green, and blue (RGB) intensi- ties. You want to compress this picture slightly, by removing one pixel from each of the m rows, so that the whole picture becomes one pixel narrower. To avoid incongruous visual effects, however, the pixels removed in two adjacent rows must lie in either the same column or adjacent columns. In this way, the pixels removed form a <seam= from the top row to the bottom row, where successive pixels in the seam are adjacent vertically or diagonally. a. Show that the number of such possible seams grows at least exponentially in m, assuming that n > 1. b. Suppose now that along with each pixel AŒi; j �, you are given a real-valued disruption measure d Œi; j �, indicating how disruptive it would be to remove pixel AŒi; j �. Intuitively, the lower a pixel’s disruption measure, the more sim- ilar the pixel is to its neighbors. Deûne the disruption measure of a seam as the sum of the disruption measures of its pixels. Give an algorithm to ûnd a seam with the lowest disruption measure. How efûcient is your algorithm? 14-9 Breaking a string A certain string-processing programming language allows you to break a string into two pieces. Because this operation copies the string, it costs n time units to break a string of n characters into two pieces. Suppose that you want to break a string into many pieces. The order in which the breaks occur can affect the total amount of time used. For example, suppose that you want to break a 20-character string after characters 2, 8, and 10 (numbering the characters in ascending order from the left-hand end, starting from 1). If you program the breaks to occur in left-to-right order, then the ûrst break costs 20 time units, the second break costs 18 time units (breaking the string from characters 3 to 20 at character 8), and the third break costs 12 time units, totaling 50 time units. If you program the breaks to occur in right-to-left order, however, then the ûrst break costs 20 time units, the Problems for Chapter 14 413 second break costs 10 time units, and the third break costs 8 time units, totaling 38 time units. In yet another order, you could break ûrst at 8 (costing 20), then break the left piece at 2 (costing another 8), and ûnally the right piece at 10 (costing 12), for a total cost of 40. Design an algorithm that, given the numbers of characters after which to break, determines a least-cost way to sequence those breaks. More formally, given an array LŒ1 W m� containing the break points for a string of n characters, compute the lowest cost for a sequence of breaks, along with a sequence of breaks that achieves this cost. 14-10 Planning an investment strategy Your knowledge of algorithms helps you obtain an exciting job with a hot startup, along with a $10,000 signing bonus. You decide to invest this money with the goal of maximizing your return at the end of 10 years. You decide to use your investment manager, G. I. Luvcache, to manage your signing bonus. The company that Luvcache works with requires you to observe the following rules. It offers n different investments, numbered 1 through n. In each year j , investment i provides a return rate of r ij . In other words, if you invest d dollars in investment i in year j , then at the end of year j , you have dr ij dollars. The return rates are guaranteed, that is, you are given all the return rates for the next 10 years for each investment. You make investment decisions only once per year. At the end of each year, you can leave the money made in the previous year in the same investments, or you can shift money to other investments, by either shifting money between existing investments or moving money to a new investment. If you do not move your money between two consecutive years, you pay a fee of f 1 dollars, whereas if you switch your money, you pay a fee of f 2 dollars, where f 2 > f 1 . You pay the fee once per year at the end of the year, and it is the same amount, f 2 , whether you move money in and out of only one investment, or in and out of many investments. a. The problem, as stated, allows you to invest your money in multiple investments in each year. Prove that there exists an optimal investment strategy that, in each year, puts all the money into a single investment. (Recall that an optimal investment strategy maximizes the amount of money after 10 years and is not concerned with any other objectives, such as minimizing risk.) b. Prove that the problem of planning your optimal investment strategy exhibits optimal substructure. c. Design an algorithm that plans your optimal investment strategy. What is the running time of your algorithm? 414 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming d. Suppose that Luvcache’s company imposes the additional restriction that, at any point, you can have no more than $15,000 in any one investment. Show that the problem of maximizing your income at the end of 10 years no longer exhibits optimal substructure. 14-11 Inventory planning The Rinky Dink Company makes machines that resurface ice rinks. The demand for such products varies from month to month, and so the company needs to de- velop a strategy to plan its manufacturing given the üuctuating, but predictable, demand. The company wishes to design a plan for the next n months. For each month i , the company knows the demand d i , that is, the number of machines that it will sell. Let D D P n i D1 d i be the total demand over the next n months. The com- pany keeps a full-time staff who provide labor to manufacture up to m machines per month. If the company needs to make more than m machines in a given month, it can hire additional, part-time labor, at a cost that works out to c dollars per ma- chine. Furthermore, if the company is holding any unsold machines at the end of a month, it must pay inventory costs. The company can hold up to D machines, with the cost for holding j machines given as a function h.j / for j D 1; 2; : : : ; D that monotonically increases with j . Give an algorithm that calculates a plan for the company that minimizes its costs while fulûlling all the demand. The running time should be polynomial in n and D. 14-12 Signing free-agent baseball players Suppose that you are the general manager for a major-league baseball team. During the off-season, you need to sign some free-agent players for your team. The team owner has given you a budget of $X to spend on free agents. You are allowed to spend less than $X , but the owner will ûre you if you spend any more than $X . You are considering N different positions, and for each position, P free-agent players who play that position are available. 10 Because you do not want to overload your roster with too many players at any position, for each position you may sign at most one free agent who plays that position. (If you do not sign any players at a particular position, then you plan to stick with the players you already have at that position.) 10 Although there are nine positions on a baseball team, N is not necessarily equal to 9 because some general managers have particular ways of thinking about positions. For example, a general manager might consider right-handed pitchers and left-handed pitchers to be separate <positions,= as well as starting pitchers, long relief pitchers (relief pitchers who can pitch several innings), and short relief pitchers (relief pitchers who normally pitch at most only one inning). Notes for Chapter 14 415 To determine how valuable a player is going to be, you decide to use a saber- metric statistic 11 known as <WAR,= or <wins above replacement.= A player with a higher WAR is more valuable than a player with a lower WAR. It is not necessarily more expensive to sign a player with a higher WAR than a player with a lower WAR, because factors other than a player’s value determine how much it costs to sign them. For each available free-agent player p, you have three pieces of information:  the player’s position,  p: cost , the amount of money it costs to sign the player, and  p: war, the player’s WAR. Devise an algorithm that maximizes the total WAR of the players you sign while spending no more than $X . You may assume that each player signs for a multiple of $100,000. Your algorithm should output the total WAR of the players you sign, the total amount of money you spend, and a list of which players you sign. Analyze the running time and space requirement of your algorithm. Chapter notes Bellman [44] began the systematic study of dynamic programming in 1955, pub- lishing a book about it in 1957. The word <programming,= both here and in linear programming, refers to using a tabular solution method. Although optimization techniques incorporating elements of dynamic programming were known earlier, Bellman provided the area with a solid mathematical basis. Galil and Park [172] classify dynamic-programming algorithms according to the size of the table and the number of other table entries each entry depends on. They call a dynamic-programming algorithm tD=eD if its table size is O.n t / and each entry depends on O.n e / other entries. For example, the matrix-chain multiplica- tion algorithm in Section 14.2 is 2D=1D, and the longest-common-subsequence algorithm in Section 14.4 is 2D=0D. The MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER algorithm on page 378 is by Muraoka and Kuck [339]. Hu and Shing [230, 231] give an O.n lg n/-time algorithm for the matrix- chain multiplication problem. The O.mn/-time algorithm for the longest-common-subsequence problem ap- pears to be a folk algorithm. Knuth [95] posed the question of whether subquadratic 11 Sabermetrics is the application of statistical analysis to baseball records. It provides several ways to compare the relative values of individual players. 416 Chapter 14 Dynamic Programming algorithms for the LCS problem exist. Masek and Paterson [316] answered this question in the afûrmative by giving an algorithm that runs in O.mn= lg n/ time, where n හ m and the sequences are drawn from a set of bounded size. For the special case in which no element appears more than once in an input sequence, Szymanski [425] shows how to solve the problem in O..n C m/ lg.n C m// time. Many of these results extend to the problem of computing string edit distances (Problem 14-5). An early paper on variable-length binary encodings by Gilbert and Moore [181], which had applications to constructing optimal binary search trees for the case in which all probabilities p i are 0, contains an O.n 3 /-time algorithm. Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] present the algorithm from Section 14.5. Splay trees [418], which modify the tree in response to the search queries, come within a constant factor of the optimal bounds without being initialized with the frequencies. Exercise 14.5-4 is due to Knuth [264]. Hu and Tucker [232] devised an algorithm for the case in which all probabilities p i are 0 that uses O.n 2 / time and O.n/ space. Subse- quently, Knuth [261] reduced the time to O.n lg n/. Problem 14-8 is due to Avidan and Shamir [30], who have posted on the web a wonderful video illustrating this image-compression technique. 15 Greedy Algorithms Algorithms for optimization problems typically go through a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. For many optimization problems, using dy- namic programming to determine the best choices is overkill, and simpler, more efûcient algorithms will do. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice leads to a globally optimal solution. This chapter explores opti- mization problems for which greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions. Before reading this chapter, you should read about dynamic programming in Chapter 14, particularly Section 14.3. Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many prob- lems they do. We ûrst examine, in Section 15.1, a simple but nontrivial problem, the activity-selection problem, for which a greedy algorithm efûciently computes an optimal solution. We’ll arrive at the greedy algorithm by ûrst considering a dynamic-programming approach and then showing that an optimal solution can re- sult from always making greedy choices. Section 15.2 reviews the basic elements of the greedy approach, giving a direct approach for proving greedy algorithms cor- rect. Section 15.3 presents an important application of greedy techniques: design- ing data-compression (Huffman) codes. Finally, Section 15.4 shows that in order to decide which blocks to replace when a miss occurs in a cache, the <furthest-in- future= strategy is optimal if the sequence of block accesses is known in advance. The greedy method is quite powerful and works well for a wide range of prob- lems. Later chapters will present many algorithms that you can view as applications of the greedy method, including minimum-spanning-tree algorithms (Chapter 21), Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths from a single source (Section 22.3), and a greedy set-covering heuristic (Section 35.3). Minimum-spanning-tree algorithms furnish a classic example of the greedy method. Although you can read this chapter and Chapter 21 independently of each other, you might ûnd it useful to read them together. 418 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms 15.1 An activity-selection problem Our ûrst example is the problem of scheduling several competing activities that re- quire exclusive use of a common resource, with a goal of selecting a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities. Imagine that you are in charge of scheduling a conference room. You are presented with a set S D fa 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n g of n pro- posed activities that wish to reserve the conference room, and the room can serve only one activity at a time. Each activity a i has a start time s i and a ûnish time f i , where 0 හ s i < f i < 1. If selected, activity a i takes place during the half-open time interval Œs i ; f i /. Activities a i and a j are compatible if the intervals Œs i ; f i / and Œs j ; f j / do not overlap. That is, a i and a j are compatible if s i  f j or s j  f i . (Assume that if your staff needs time to change over the room from one activity to the next, the changeover time is built into the intervals.) In the activity-selection problem, your goal is to select a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible ac- tivities. Assume that the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order of ûnish time: f 1 හ f 2 හ f 3 හ    හ f n1 හ f n : (15.1) (We’ll see later the advantage that this assumption provides.) For example, con- sider the set of activities in Figure 15.1. The subset fa 3 ; a 9 ; a 11 g consists of mutu- ally compatible activities. It is not a maximum subset, however, since the subset fa 1 ; a 4 ; a 8 ; a 11 g is larger. In fact, fa 1 ; a 4 ; a 8 ; a 11 g is a largest subset of mutually compatible activities, and another largest subset is fa 2 ; a 4 ; a 9 ; a 11 g. We’ll see how to solve this problem, proceeding in several steps. First we’ll explore a dynamic-programming solution, in which you consider several choices when determining which subproblems to use in an optimal solution. We’ll then observe that you need to consider only one choice4the greedy choice4and that when you make the greedy choice, only one subproblem remains. Based on these observations, we’ll develop a recursive greedy algorithm to solve the activity- selection problem. Finally, we’ll complete the process of developing a greedy solution by converting the recursive algorithm to an iterative one. Although the steps we go through in this section are slightly more involved than is typical when developing a greedy algorithm, they illustrate the relationship between greedy al- gorithms and dynamic programming. i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 s i 1 3 0 5 3 5 6 7 8 2 12 f i 4 5 6 7 9 9 10 11 12 14 16 Figure 15.1 A set fa 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a 11 g of activities. Activity a i has start time s i and ûnish time f i . 15.1 An activity-selection problem 419 The optimal substructure of the activity-selection problem Let’s verify that the activity-selection problem exhibits optimal substructure. De- note by S ij the set of activities that start after activity a i ûnishes and that ûnish before activity a j starts. Suppose that you want to ûnd a maximum set of mutually compatible activities in S ij , and suppose further that such a maximum set is A ij , which includes some activity a k . By including a k in an optimal solution, you are left with two subproblems: ûnding mutually compatible activities in the set S i k (activities that start after activity a i ûnishes and that ûnish before activity a k starts) and ûnding mutually compatible activities in the set S kj (activities that start after activity a k ûnishes and that ûnish before activity a j starts). Let A i k D A ij \\ S i k and A kj D A ij \\ S kj , so that A i k contains the activities in A ij that ûnish before a k starts and A kj contains the activities in A ij that start after a k ûnishes. Thus, we have A ij D A i k [ fa k g [ A kj , and so the maximum-size set A ij of mutually com- patible activities in S ij consists of jA ij j D jA i k j C jA kj j C 1 activities. The usual cut-and-paste argument shows that an optimal solution A ij must also include optimal solutions to the two subproblems for S i k and S kj . If you could ûnd a set A 0 kj of mutually compatible activities in S kj where jA 0 kj j > jA kj j, then you could use A 0 kj , rather than A kj , in a solution to the subproblem for S ij . You would have constructed a set of jA i k j C jA 0 kj j C 1 > jA i k j C jA kj j C 1 D jA ij j mutually compatible activities, which contradicts the assumption that A ij is an optimal solution. A symmetric argument applies to the activities in S i k . This way of characterizing optimal substructure suggests that you can solve the activity-selection problem by dynamic programming. Let’s denote the size of an optimal solution for the set S ij by cŒi; j �. Then, the dynamic-programming ap- proach gives the recurrence cŒi; j � D cŒi; k� C cŒk; j � C 1 : Of course, if you do not know that an optimal solution for the set S ij includes activity a k , you must examine all activities in S ij to ûnd which one to choose, so that cŒi; j � D ( 0 if S ij D ; ; max fcŒi; k� C cŒk; j � C 1 W a k 2 S ij g if S ij ¤ ; : (15.2) You can then develop a recursive algorithm and memoize it, or you can work bottom-up and ûll in table entries as you go along. But you would be overlooking another important characteristic of the activity-selection problem that you can use to great advantage. 420 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms Making the greedy choice What if you could choose an activity to add to an optimal solution without having to ûrst solve all the subproblems? That could save you from having to consider all the choices inherent in recurrence (15.2). In fact, for the activity-selection problem, you need to consider only one choice: the greedy choice. What is the greedy choice for the activity-selection problem? Intuition suggests that you should choose an activity that leaves the resource available for as many other activities as possible. Of the activities you end up choosing, one of them must be the ûrst one to ûnish. Intuition says, therefore, choose the activity in S with the earliest ûnish time, since that leaves the resource available for as many of the activities that follow it as possible. (If more than one activity in S has the earliest ûnish time, then choose any such activity.) In other words, since the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order by ûnish time, the greedy choice is activity a 1 . Choosing the ûrst activity to ûnish is not the only way to think of making a greedy choice for this problem. Exercise 15.1-3 asks you to explore other possibilities. Once you make the greedy choice, you have only one remaining subproblem to solve: ûnding activities that start after a 1 ûnishes. Why don’t you have to consider activities that ûnish before a 1 starts? Because s 1 < f 1 , and because f 1 is the earliest ûnish time of any activity, no activity can have a ûnish time less than or equal to s 1 . Thus, all activities that are compatible with activity a 1 must start after a 1 ûnishes. Furthermore, we have already established that the activity-selection problem ex- hibits optimal substructure. Let S k D fa i 2 S W s i  f k g be the set of activities that start after activity a k ûnishes. If you make the greedy choice of activity a 1 , then S 1 remains as the only subproblem to solve. 1 Optimal substructure says that if a 1 belongs to an optimal solution, then an optimal solution to the original problem consists of activity a 1 and all the activities in an optimal solution to the subprob- lem S 1 . One big question remains: Is this intuition correct? Is the greedy choice4in which you choose the ûrst activity to ûnish4always part of some optimal solution? The following theorem shows that it is. 1 We sometimes refer to the sets S k as subproblems rather than as just sets of activities. The context will make it clear whether we are referring to S k as a set of activities or as a subproblem whose input is that set. 15.1 An activity-selection problem 421 Theorem 15.1 Consider any nonempty subproblem S k , and let a m be an activity in S k with the earliest ûnish time. Then a m is included in some maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities of S k . Proof Let A k be a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities in S k , and let a j be the activity in A k with the earliest ûnish time. If a j D a m , we are done, since we have shown that a m belongs to some maximum-size subset of mutu- ally compatible activities of S k . If a j ¤ a m , let the set A 0 k D .A k  fa j g/ [ fa m g be A k but substituting a m for a j . The activities in A 0 k are compatible, which fol- lows because the activities in A k are compatible, a j is the ûrst activity in A k to ûnish, and f m හ f j . Since jA 0 k j D jA k j, we conclude that A 0 k is a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities of S k , and it includes a m . Although you might be able to solve the activity-selection problem with dynamic programming, Theorem 15.1 says that you don’t need to. Instead, you can repeat- edly choose the activity that ûnishes ûrst, keep only the activities compatible with this activity, and repeat until no activities remain. Moreover, because you always choose the activity with the earliest ûnish time, the ûnish times of the activities that you choose must strictly increase. You can consider each activity just once overall, in monotonically increasing order of ûnish times. An algorithm to solve the activity-selection problem does not need to work bottom-up, like a table-based dynamic-programming algorithm. Instead, it can work top-down, choosing an activity to put into the optimal solution that it con- structs and then solving the subproblem of choosing activities from those that are compatible with those already chosen. Greedy algorithms typically have this top- down design: make a choice and then solve a subproblem, rather than the bottom- up technique of solving subproblems before making a choice. A recursive greedy algorithm Now that you know you can bypass the dynamic-programming approach and in- stead use a top-down, greedy algorithm, let’s see a straightforward, recursive procedure to solve the activity-selection problem. The procedure RECURSIVE- ACTIVITY-SELECTOR on the following page takes the start and ûnish times of the activities, represented as arrays s and f , 2 the index k that deûnes the subprob- lem S k it is to solve, and the size n of the original problem. It returns a maximum- 2 Because the pseudocode takes s and f as arrays, it indexes into them with square brackets rather than with subscripts. 422 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms size set of mutually compatible activities in S k . The procedure assumes that the n input activities are already ordered by monotonically increasing ûnish time, ac- cording to equation (15.1). If not, you can ûrst sort them into this order in O.n lg n/ time, breaking ties arbitrarily. In order to start, add the ûctitious activity a 0 with f 0 D 0, so that subproblem S 0 is the entire set of activities S . The initial call, which solves the entire problem, is RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; 0; n/. RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; k; n/ 1 m D k C 1 2 while m හ n and sŒm� < f Œk� // ûnd the ûrst activity in S k to ûnish 3 m D m C 1 4 if m හ n 5 return fa m g [ RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; m; n/ 6 else return ; Figure 15.2 shows how the algorithm operates on the activities in Figure 15.1. In a given recursive call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; k; n/, the while loop of lines 233 looks for the ûrst activity in S k to ûnish. The loop examines a kC1 ; a kC2 ; : : : ; a n , until it ûnds the ûrst activity a m that is compatible with a k , which means that s m  f k . If the loop terminates because it ûnds such an activity, line 5 returns the union of fa m g and the maximum-size subset of S m returned by the recursive call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; m; n/. Alternatively, the loop may terminate because m > n, in which case the procedure has examined all activities in S k without ûnding one that is compatible with a k . In this case, S k D ;, and so line 6 returns ;. Assuming that the activities have already been sorted by ûnish times, the run- ning time of the call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; 0; n/ is ‚.n/. To see why, observe that over all recursive calls, each activity is examined exactly once in the while loop test of line 2. In particular, activity a i is examined in the last call made in which k < i . An iterative greedy algorithm The recursive procedure can be converted to an iterative one because the procedure RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR is almost <tail recursive= (see Problem 7-5): it ends with a recursive call to itself followed by a union operation. It is usually a straightforward task to transform a tail-recursive procedure to an iterative form. In fact, some compilers for certain programming languages perform this task auto- matically. 15.1 An activity-selection problem 423 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 time 2 3 5 3 0 6 4 5 7 5 3 9 6 5 9 7 6 10 8 7 11 9 8 12 10 2 14 11 12 16 1 1 4 i s i f i a 1 a 2 a 1 a 3 a 1 a 4 a 1 a 4 a 5 a 1 a 4 a 6 a 1 a 4 a 7 a 1 a 4 a 8 a 1 a 4 a 8 a 9 a 1 a 4 a 8 a 10 a 1 a 4 a 8 a 11 a 1 a 4 a 8 a 11 0 – 0 a 1 a 0 a 0 RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f, 0, 11) RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f, 1, 11) RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f, 4, 11) RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f, 8, 11) m = 1 m = 4 m = 8 m = 11 RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR(s, f, 11, 11) 15 16 Figure 15.2 The operation of R ECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR on the 11 activities from Fig- ure 15.1. Activities considered in each recursive call appear between horizontal lines. The ûctitious activity a 0 ûnishes at time 0, and the initial call R ECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR.s; f; 0; 11/, selects activity a 1 . In each recursive call, the activities that have already been selected are blue, and the activity shown in tan is being considered. If the starting time of an activity occurs before the ûnish time of the most recently added activity (the arrow between them points left), it is re- jected. Otherwise (the arrow points directly up or to the right), it is selected. The last recursive call, RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR.s; f; 11; 11/, returns ;. The resulting set of selected activities is fa 1 ; a 4 ; a 8 ; a 11 g. 424 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms The procedure GREEDY-ACTIVITY-S ELECTOR is an iterative version of the pro- cedure RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR. It, too, assumes that the input activi- ties are ordered by monotonically increasing ûnish time. It collects selected activ- ities into a set A and returns this set when it is done.

The variable k indexes the most recent ad- dition to A, corresponding to the activity a k in the recursive version. Since the procedure considers the activities in order of monotonically increasing ûnish time, f k is always the maximum ûnish time of any activity in A. That is, f k D max ff i W a i 2 Ag : (15.3) Lines 132 select activity a 1 , initialize A to contain just this activity, and initialize k to index this activity. The for loop of lines 336 ûnds the earliest activity in S k to ûnish. The loop considers each activity a m in turn and adds a m to A if it is compat- ible with all previously selected activities. Such an activity is the earliest in S k to ûnish. To see whether activity a m is compatible with every activity currently in A, it sufûces by equation (15.3) to check (in line 4) that its start time s m is not earlier than the ûnish time f k of the activity most recently added to A. If activity a m is compatible, then lines 536 add activity a m to A and set k to m. The set A returned by the call GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f / is precisely the set returned by the initial call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR .s; f; 0; n/. Like the recursive version, GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR schedules a set of n activities in ‚.n/ time, assuming that the activities were already sorted initially by their ûnish times. Exercises 15.1-1 Give a dynamic-programming algorithm for the activity-selection problem, based on recurrence (15.2). Have your algorithm compute the sizes cŒi; j � as deûned above and also produce the maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activities. 15.1 An activity-selection problem 425 Assume that the inputs have been sorted as in equation (15.1). Compare the running time of your solution to the running time of GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR. 15.1-2 Suppose that instead of always selecting the ûrst activity to ûnish, you instead select the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activi- ties. Describe how this approach is a greedy algorithm, and prove that it yields an optimal solution. 15.1-3 Not just any greedy approach to the activity-selection problem produces a max- imum-size set of mutually compatible activities. Give an example to show that the approach of selecting the activity of least duration from among those that are compatible with previously selected activities does not work. Do the same for the approaches of always selecting the compatible activity that overlaps the fewest other remaining activities and always selecting the compatible remaining activity with the earliest start time. 15.1-4 You are given a set of activities to schedule among a large number of lecture halls, where any activity can take place in any lecture hall. You wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an efûcient greedy algorithm to determine which activity should use which lecture hall. (This problem is also known as the interval-graph coloring problem. It is mod- eled by an interval graph whose vertices are the given activities and whose edges connect incompatible activities. The smallest number of colors required to color every vertex so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color corresponds to ûnding the fewest lecture halls needed to schedule all of the given activities.) 15.1-5 Consider a modiûcation to the activity-selection problem in which each activity a i has, in addition to a start and ûnish time, a value v i . The objective is no longer to maximize the number of activities scheduled, but instead to maximize the total value of the activities scheduled. That is, the goal is to choose a set A of compatible activities such that P a k 2A v k is maximized. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. 426 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms 15.2 Elements of the greedy strategy A greedy algorithm obtains an optimal solution to a problem by making a sequence of choices. At each decision point, the algorithm makes the choice that seems best at the moment. This heuristic strategy does not always produce an optimal solution, but as in the activity-selection problem, sometimes it does. This section discusses some of the general properties of greedy methods. The process that we followed in Section 15.1 to develop a greedy algorithm was a bit more involved than is typical. It consisted of the following steps: 1. Determine the optimal substructure of the problem. 2. Develop a recursive solution. (For the activity-selection problem, we formu- lated recurrence (15.2), but bypassed developing a recursive algorithm based solely on this recurrence.) 3. Show that if you make the greedy choice, then only one subproblem remains. 4. Prove that it is always safe to make the greedy choice. (Steps 3 and 4 can occur in either order.) 5. Develop a recursive algorithm that implements the greedy strategy. 6. Convert the recursive algorithm to an iterative algorithm. These steps highlighted in great detail the dynamic-programming underpinnings of a greedy algorithm. For example, the ûrst cut at the activity-selection problem deûned the subproblems S ij , where both i and j varied. We then found that if you always make the greedy choice, you can restrict the subproblems to be of the form S k . An alternative approach is to fashion optimal substructure with a greedy choice in mind, so that the choice leaves just one subproblem to solve. In the activity- selection problem, start by dropping the second subscript and deûning subproblems of the form S k . Then prove that a greedy choice (the ûrst activity a m to ûnish in S k ), combined with an optimal solution to the remaining set S m of compatible activities, yields an optimal solution to S k . More generally, you can design greedy algorithms according to the following sequence of steps: 1. Cast the optimization problem as one in which you make a choice and are left with one subproblem to solve. 2. Prove that there is always an optimal solution to the original problem that makes the greedy choice, so that the greedy choice is always safe. 3. Demonstrate optimal substructure by showing that, having made the greedy choice, what remains is a subproblem with the property that if you combine an 15.2 Elements of the greedy strategy 427 optimal solution to the subproblem with the greedy choice you have made, you arrive at an optimal solution to the original problem. Later sections of this chapter will use this more direct process. Nevertheless, be- neath every greedy algorithm, there is almost always a more cumbersome dynamic- programming solution. How can you tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular optimization problem? No way works all the time, but the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure are the two key ingredients. If you can demonstrate that the problem has these properties, then you are well on the way to developing a greedy algorithm for it. Greedy-choice property The ûrst key ingredient is the greedy-choice property: you can assemble a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices. In other words, when you are considering which choice to make, you make the choice that looks best in the current problem, without considering results from subproblems. Here is where greedy algorithms differ from dynamic programming. In dynamic programming, you make a choice at each step, but the choice usually depends on the solutions to subproblems. Consequently, you typically solve dynamic- programming problems in a bottom-up manner, progressing from smaller sub- problems to larger subproblems. (Alternatively, you can solve them top down, but memoizing. Of course, even though the code works top down, you still must solve the subproblems before making a choice.) In a greedy algorithm, you make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblem that re- mains. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices so far, but it cannot depend on any future choices or on the solutions to subproblems. Thus, un- like dynamic programming, which solves the subproblems before making the ûrst choice, a greedy algorithm makes its ûrst choice before solving any subproblems. A dynamic-programming algorithm proceeds bottom up, whereas a greedy strat- egy usually progresses top down, making one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem instance to a smaller one. Of course, you need to prove that a greedy choice at each step yields a globally optimal solution. Typically, as in the case of Theorem 15.1, the proof examines a globally optimal solution to some subproblem. It then shows how to modify the solution to substitute the greedy choice for some other choice, resulting in one similar, but smaller, subproblem. You can usually make the greedy choice more efûciently than when you have to consider a wider set of choices. For example, in the activity-selection problem, assuming that the activities were already sorted in monotonically increasing order by ûnish times, each activity needed to be examined just once. By preprocessing 428 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms the input or by using an appropriate data structure (often a priority queue), you often can make greedy choices quickly, thus yielding an efûcient algorithm. Optimal substructure As we saw in Chapter 14, a problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems. This property is a key ingredient of assessing whether dynamic programming applies, and it’s also essential for greedy algorithms. As an example of optimal substruc- ture, recall how Section 15.1 demonstrated that if an optimal solution to subprob- lem S ij includes an activity a k , then it must also contain optimal solutions to the subproblems S i k and S kj . Given this optimal substructure, we argued that if you know which activity to use as a k , you can construct an optimal solution to S ij by selecting a k along with all activities in optimal solutions to the subproblems S i k and S kj . This observation of optimal substructure gave rise to the recurrence (15.2) that describes the value of an optimal solution. You will usually use a more direct approach regarding optimal substructure when applying it to greedy algorithms. As mentioned above, you have the luxury of assuming that you arrived at a subproblem by having made the greedy choice in the original problem. All you really need to do is argue that an optimal solution to the subproblem, combined with the greedy choice already made, yields an optimal solution to the original problem. This scheme implicitly uses induction on the subproblems to prove that making the greedy choice at every step produces an optimal solution. Greedy versus dynamic programming Because both the greedy and dynamic-programming strategies exploit optimal sub- structure, you might be tempted to generate a dynamic-programming solution to a problem when a greedy solution sufûces or, conversely, you might mistakenly think that a greedy solution works when in fact a dynamic-programming solution is required. To illustrate the subtle differences between the two techniques, let’s investigate two variants of a classical optimization problem. The 0-1 knapsack problem is the following. A thief robbing a store wants to take the most valuable load that can be carried in a knapsack capable of carrying at most W pounds of loot. The thief can choose to take any subset of n items in the store. The i th item is worth v i dollars and weighs w i pounds, where v i and w i are integers. Which items should the thief take? (We call this the 0-1 knapsack problem because for each item, the thief must either take it or leave it behind. The thief cannot take a fractional amount of an item or take an item more than once.) 15.2 Elements of the greedy strategy 429 In the fractional knapsack problem, the setup is the same, but the thief can take fractions of items, rather than having to make a binary (0-1) choice for each item. You can think of an item in the 0-1 knapsack problem as being like a gold ingot and an item in the fractional knapsack problem as more like gold dust. Both knapsack problems exhibit the optimal-substructure property. For the 0-1 problem, if the most valuable load weighing at most W pounds includes item j , then the remaining load must be the most valuable load weighing at most W  w j pounds that the thief can take from the n  1 original items excluding item j . For the comparable fractional problem, if if the most valuable load weighing at most W pounds includes weight w of item j , then the remaining load must be the most valuable load weighing at most W  w pounds that the thief can take from the n  1 original items plus w j  w pounds of item j . Although the problems are similar, a greedy strategy works to solve the frac- tional knapsack problem, but not the 0-1 problem. To solve the fractional problem, ûrst compute the value per pound v i =w i for each item. Obeying a greedy strategy, the thief begins by taking as much as possible of the item with the greatest value per pound. If the supply of that item is exhausted and the thief can still carry more, then the thief takes as much as possible of the item with the next greatest value per pound, and so forth, until reaching the weight limit W . Thus, by sorting the items by value per pound, the greedy algorithm runs in O.n lg n/ time. You are asked to prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property in Exercise 15.2-1. To see that this greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem, consider the problem instance illustrated in Figure 15.3(a). This example has three items and a knapsack that can hold 50 pounds. Item 1 weighs 10 pounds and is worth $60. Item 2 weighs 20 pounds and is worth $100. Item 3 weighs 30 pounds and is worth $120. Thus, the value per pound of item 1 is $6 per pound, which is greater than the value per pound of either item 2 ($5 per pound) or item 3 ($4 per pound). The greedy strategy, therefore, would take item 1 ûrst. As you can see from the case analysis in Figure 15.3(b), however, the optimal solution takes items 2 and 3, leaving item 1 behind. The two possible solutions that take item 1 are both suboptimal. For the comparable fractional problem, however, the greedy strategy, which takes item 1 ûrst, does yield an optimal solution, as shown in Figure 15.3(c). Tak- ing item 1 doesn’t work in the 0-1 problem, because the thief is unable to ûll the knapsack to capacity, and the empty space lowers the effective value per pound of the load. In the 0-1 problem, when you consider whether to include an item in the knapsack, you must compare the solution to the subproblem that includes the item with the solution to the subproblem that excludes the item before you can make the choice. The problem formulated in this way gives rise to many overlapping sub- 430 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms 10 $60 item 1 20 $100 item 2 30 $120 item 3 50 knapsack (a) + $120 $100 = $220 + $60 $100 = $160 + $60 $120 = $180 (b) + $60 $100 = $240 $80 + (c) 20 30 10 20 10 30 10 20 20 Figure 15.3 An example showing that the greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack problem.

Any solution with item 1 is suboptimal, even though item 1 has the greatest value per pound. (c) For the fractional knapsack problem, taking the items in order of greatest value per pound yields an optimal solution. problems4a hallmark of dynamic programming, and indeed, as Exercise 15.2-2 asks you to show, you can use dynamic programming to solve the 0-1 problem. Exercises 15.2-1 Prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property. 15.2-2 Give a dynamic-programming solution to the 0-1 knapsack problem that runs in O.n W / time, where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight of items that the thief can put in the knapsack. 15.2-3 Suppose that in a 0-1 knapsack problem, the order of the items when sorted by increasing weight is the same as their order when sorted by decreasing value. Give an efûcient algorithm to ûnd an optimal solution to this variant of the knapsack problem, and argue that your algorithm is correct. 15.2-4 Professor Gekko has always dreamed of inline skating across North Dakota. The professor plans to cross the state on highway U.S. 2, which runs from Grand Forks, on the eastern border with Minnesota, to Williston, near the western border with Montana. The professor can carry two liters of water and can skate m miles before 15.3 Huffman codes 431 running out of water. (Because North Dakota is relatively üat, the professor does not have to worry about drinking water at a greater rate on uphill sections than on üat or downhill sections.) The professor will start in Grand Forks with two full liters of water. The professor has an ofûcial North Dakota state map, which shows all the places along U.S. 2 to reûll water and the distances between these locations. The professor’s goal is to minimize the number of water stops along the route across the state. Give an efûcient method by which the professor can determine which water stops to make.

Prove that your algorithm maximizes the payoff, and state its running time, omitting the time for reordering the sets. 15.3 Huffman codes Huffman codes compress data well: savings of 20% to 90% are typical, depending on the characteristics of the data being compressed. The data arrive as a sequence of characters. Huffman’s greedy algorithm uses a table giving how often each character occurs (its frequency) to build up an optimal way of representing each character as a binary string. Suppose that you have a 100,000-character data ûle that you wish to store com- pactly and you know that the 6 distinct characters in the ûle occur with the frequen- cies given by Figure 15.4. The character a occurs 45,000 times, the character b occurs 13,000 times, and so on. You have many options for how to represent such a ûle of information. Here, we consider the problem of designing a binary character code (or code for short) 432 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms a b c d e f Frequency (in thousands) 45 13 12 16 9 5 Fixed-length codeword 000 001 010 011 100 101 Variable-length codeword 0 101 100 111 1101 1100 Figure 15.4 A character-coding problem. A data ûle of 100,000 characters contains only the char- acters a–f, with the frequencies indicated. With each character represented by a 3-bit codeword, encoding the ûle requires 300,000 bits. With the variable-length code shown, the encoding requires only 224,000 bits. in which each character is represented by a unique binary string, which we call a codeword. If you use a ûxed-length code, you need dlg ne bits to represent n  2 characters. For 6 characters, therefore, you need 3 bits: a = 000, b = 001, c = 010, d = 011, e = 100, and f = 101. This method requires 300,000 bits to encode the entire ûle. Can you do better? A variable-length code can do considerably better than a ûxed-length code. The idea is simple: give frequent characters short codewords and infrequent characters long codewords. Figure 15.4 shows such a code. Here, the 1-bit string 0 represents a, and the 4-bit string 1100 represents f. This code requires .45  1 C 13  3 C 12  3 C 16  3 C 9  4 C 5  4/  1,000 D 224,000 bits to represent the ûle, a savings of approximately 25%. In fact, this is an optimal character code for this ûle, as we shall see. Preûx-free codes We consider here only codes in which no codeword is also a preûx of some other codeword. Such codes are called preûx-free codes. Although we won’t prove it here, a preûx-free code can always achieve the optimal data compression among any character code, and so we suffer no loss of generality by restricting our atten- tion to preûx-free codes. Encoding is always simple for any binary character code: just concatenate the codewords representing each character of the ûle. For example, with the variable- length preûx-free code of Figure 15.4, the 4-character ûle face has the encoding 1100  0  100  1101 D 110001001101, where <= denotes concatenation. Preûx-free codes are desirable because they simplify decoding. Since no code- word is a preûx of any other, the codeword that begins an encoded ûle is unambigu- ous. You can simply identify the initial codeword, translate it back to the original character, and repeat the decoding process on the remainder of the encoded ûle. In our example, the string 100011001101 parses uniquely as 100  0  1100  1101, which decodes to cafe. 15.3 Huffman codes 433 a:45 b:13 c:12 d:16 e:9 f:5 58 28 14 86 14 100 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 25 0 1 d:16 30 0 1 55 0 1 a:45 100 0 1 (a) (b) Figure 15.5 Trees corresponding to the coding schemes in Figure 15.4. Each leaf is labeled with a character and its frequency of occurrence. Each internal node is labeled with the sum of the frequen- cies of the leaves in its subtree. All frequencies are in thousands. (a) The tree corresponding to the ûxed-length code a = 000, b = 001, c = 010, d = 011, e = 100, f = 101. (b) The tree corresponding to the optimal preûx-free code a = 0, b = 101, c = 100, d = 111, e = 1101, f = 1100. The decoding process needs a convenient representation for the preûx-free code so that you can easily pick off the initial codeword. A binary tree whose leaves are the given characters provides one such representation. Interpret the binary codeword for a character as the simple path from the root to that character, where 0 means <go to the left child= and 1 means <go to the right child.= Figure 15.5 shows the trees for the two codes of our example. Note that these are not binary search trees, since the leaves need not appear in sorted order and internal nodes do not contain character keys. An optimal code for a ûle is always represented by a full binary tree, in which every nonleaf node has two children (see Exercise 15.3-2). The ûxed-length code in our example is not optimal since its tree, shown in Figure 15.5(a), is not a full binary tree: it contains codewords beginning with 10, but none beginning with 11. Since we can now restrict our attention to full binary trees, we can say that if C is the alphabet from which the characters are drawn and all character frequencies are positive, then the tree for an optimal preûx-free code has exactly jC j leaves, one for each letter of the alphabet, and exactly jC j  1 internal nodes (see Exercise B.5-3 on page 1175). Given a tree T corresponding to a preûx-free code, we can compute the number of bits required to encode a ûle. For each character c in the alphabet C , let the attribute c: freq denote the frequency of c in the ûle and let d T .c/ denote the depth of c ’s leaf in the tree. Note that d T .c/ is also the length of the codeword for character c . The number of bits required to encode a ûle is thus 434 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms B.T / D X c2C c: freq  d T .c/ ; (15.4) which we deûne as the cost of the tree T . Constructing a Huffman code Huffman invented a greedy algorithm that constructs an optimal preûx-free code, called a Huffman code in his honor. In line with our observations in Section 15.2, its proof of correctness relies on the greedy-choice property and optimal substruc- ture. Rather than demonstrating that these properties hold and then developing pseudocode, we present the pseudocode ûrst. Doing so will help clarify how the algorithm makes greedy choices. The procedure HUFFMAN assumes that C is a set of n characters and that each character c 2 C is an object with an attribute c: freq giving its frequency. The algo- rithm builds the tree T corresponding to an optimal code in a bottom-up manner. It begins with a set of jC j leaves and performs a sequence of jC j  1 <merging= op- erations to create the ûnal tree. The algorithm uses a min-priority queue Q, keyed on the freq attribute, to identify the two least-frequent objects to merge together. The result of merging two objects is a new object whose frequency is the sum of the frequencies of the two objects that were merged.

Since the alphabet contains 6 letters, the initial queue size is n D 6, and 5 merge steps build the tree. The ûnal tree represents the optimal preûx-free code. The codeword for a letter is the sequence of edge labels on the simple path from the root to the letter. 15.3 Huffman codes 435 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 25 0 1 d:16 30 0 1 55 0 1 a:45 100 0 1 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 25 0 1 d:16 30 0 1 55 0 1 a:45 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 25 0 1 d:16 30 0 1 a:45 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 25 0 1 d:16 a:45 e:9 f:5 14 0 1 c:12 b:13 d:16 a:45 e:9 f:5 c:12 b:13 d:16 a:45 (a) (c) (e) (b) (f) Figure 15.6 The steps of Huffman’s algorithm for the frequencies given in Figure 15.4. Each part shows the contents of the queue sorted into increasing order by frequency. Each step merges the two trees with the lowest frequencies. Leaves are shown as rectangles containing a character and its frequency. Internal nodes are shown as circles containing the sum of the frequencies of their children. An edge connecting an internal node with its children is labeled 0 if it is an edge to a left child and 1 if it is an edge to a right child. The codeword for a letter is the sequence of labels on the edges connecting the root to the leaf for that letter. (a) The initial set of n D 6 nodes, one for each letter. (b)–(e) Intermediate stages. (f) The ûnal tree. The HUFFMAN procedure works as follows. Line 2 initializes the min-priority queue Q with the characters in C . The for loop in lines 3310 repeatedly extracts the two nodes x and y of lowest frequency from the queue and replaces them in the queue with a new node ´ representing their merger. The frequency of ´ is computed as the sum of the frequencies of x and y in line 9. The node ´ has x as its left child and y as its right child. (This order is arbitrary. Switching the left and right child of any node yields a different code of the same cost.) After n  1 mergers, line 11 returns the one node left in the queue, which is the root of the code tree. 436 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms The algorithm produces the same result without the variables x and y , assigning the values returned by the EXTRACT-MIN calls directly to ´: left and ´: right in lines 7 and 8, and changing line 9 to ´: freq D ´: left : freq C ´: right : freq. We’ll use the node names x and y in the proof of correctness, however, so we leave them in. The running time of Huffman’s algorithm depends on how the min-priority queue Q is implemented. Let’s assume that it’s implemented as a binary min-heap (see Chapter 6). For a set C of n characters, the BUILD-MIN-HEAP procedure dis- cussed in Section 6.3 can initialize Q in line 2 in O.n/ time. The for loop in lines 3310 executes exactly n  1 times, and since each heap operation runs in O.lg n/ time, the loop contributes O.n lg n/ to the running time. Thus, the total running time of HUFFMAN on a set of n characters is O.n lg n/. Correctness of Huffman’s algorithm To prove that the greedy algorithm HUFFMAN is correct, we’ll show that the prob- lem of determining an optimal preûx-free code exhibits the greedy-choice and optimal-substructure properties. The next lemma shows that the greedy-choice property holds. Lemma 15.2 (Optimal preûx-free codes have the greedy-choice property) Let C be an alphabet in which each character c 2 C has frequency c: freq. Let x and y be two characters in C having the lowest frequencies. Then there exists an optimal preûx-free code for C in which the codewords for x and y have the same length and differ only in the last bit. Proof The idea of the proof is to take the tree T representing an arbitrary optimal preûx-free code and modify it to make a tree representing another optimal preûx- free code such that the characters x and y appear as sibling leaves of maximum depth in the new tree. In such a tree, the codewords for x and y have the same length and differ only in the last bit. Let a and b be any two characters that are sibling leaves of maximum depth in T . Without loss of generality, assume that a: freq හ b: freq and x: freq හ y: freq. Since x: freq and y: freq are the two lowest leaf frequencies, in order, and a: freq and b: freq are two arbitrary frequencies, in order, we have x: freq හ a: freq and y: freq හ b: freq. In the remainder of the proof, it is possible that we could have x: freq D a: freq or y: freq D b: freq, but x: freq D b: freq implies that a: freq D b: freq D x: freq D y: freq (see Exercise 15.3-1), and the lemma would be trivially true. Therefore, assume that x: freq ¤ b: freq, which means that x ¤ b. As Figure 15.7 shows, imagine exchanging the positions in T of a and x to produce a tree T 0 , and then exchanging the positions in T 0 of b and y to produce a 15.3 Huffman codes 437 x y a b x y a b x y a b T T 0 T 00 Figure 15.7 An illustration of the key step in the proof of Lemma 15.2. In the optimal tree T , leaves a and b are two siblings of maximum depth. Leaves x and y are the two characters with the lowest frequencies. They appear in arbitrary positions in T . Assuming that x ¤ b, swapping leaves a and x produces tree T 0 , and then swapping leaves b and y produces tree T 00 . Since each swap does not increase the cost, the resulting tree T 00 is also an optimal tree. tree T 00 in which x and y are sibling leaves of maximum depth. (Note that if x D b but y ¤ a, then tree T 00 does not have x and y as sibling leaves of maximum depth. Because we assume that x ¤ b, this situation cannot occur.) By equation (15.4), the difference in cost between T and T 0 is B.T /  B.T 0 / D X c2C c: freq  d T .c/  X c2C c: freq  d T 0 .c/ D x: freq  d T .x/ C a: freq  d T .a/  x: freq  d T 0 .x/  a: freq  d T 0 .a/ D x: freq  d T .x/ C a: freq  d T .a/  x: freq  d T .a/  a: freq  d T .x/ D .a: freq  x: freq/.d T .a/  d T .x//  0 ; because both a: freq  x: freq and d T .a/  d T .x/ are nonnegative. More speciû- cally, a: freq  x: freq is nonnegative because x is a minimum-frequency leaf, and d T .a/  d T .x/ is nonnegative because a is a leaf of maximum depth in T . Sim- ilarly, exchanging y and b does not increase the cost, and so B.T 0 /  B.T 00 / is nonnegative. Therefore, B.T 00 / හ B.T 0 / හ B.T /, and since T is optimal, we have B.T / හ B.T 00 /, which implies B.T 00 / D B.T /. Thus, T 00 is an optimal tree in which x and y appear as sibling leaves of maximum depth, from which the lemma follows. Lemma 15.2 implies that the process of building up an optimal tree by mergers can, without loss of generality, begin with the greedy choice of merging together those two characters of lowest frequency. Why is this a greedy choice? We can view the cost of a single merger as being the sum of the frequencies of the two items being merged. Exercise 15.3-4 shows that the total cost of the tree constructed equals the sum of the costs of its mergers. Of all possible mergers at each step, HUFFMAN chooses the one that incurs the least cost. 438 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms The next lemma shows that the problem of constructing optimal preûx-free codes has the optimal-substructure property. Lemma 15.3 (Optimal preûx-free codes have the optimal-substructure property) Let C be a given alphabet with frequency c: freq deûned for each character c 2 C . Let x and y be two characters in C with minimum frequency. Let C 0 be the alpha- bet C with the characters x and y removed and a new character ´ added, so that C 0 D .C  fx; y g/ [ f´g. Deûne freq for all characters in C 0 with the same values as in C , along with ´: freq D x: freq C y: freq. Let T 0 be any tree representing an optimal preûx-free code for alphabet C 0 . Then the tree T , obtained from T 0 by replacing the leaf node for ´ with an internal node having x and y as children, represents an optimal preûx-free code for the alphabet C . Proof We ûrst show how to express the cost B.T / of tree T in terms of the cost B.T 0 / of tree T 0 , by considering the component costs in equation (15.4). For each character c 2 C  fx; y g, we have that d T .c/ D d T 0 .c/, and hence c: freq  d T .c/ D c: freq  d T 0 .c/. Since d T .x/ D d T .y/ D d T 0 .´/ C 1, we have x: freq  d T .x/ C y: freq  d T .y/ D .x: freq C y: freq/.d T 0 .´/ C 1/ D ´: freq  d T 0 .´/ C .x: freq C y: freq/ ; from which we conclude that B.T / D B.T 0 / C x: freq C y: freq or, equivalently, B.T 0 / D B.T /  x: freq  y: freq : We now prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose that T does not represent an optimal preûx-free code for C . Then there exists an optimal tree T 00 such that B.T 00 / < B.T /. Without loss of generality (by Lemma 15.2), T 00 has x and y as siblings. Let T 000 be the tree T 00 with the common parent of x and y replaced by a leaf ´ with frequency ´: freq D x: freq C y: freq. Then B.T 000 / D B.T 00 /  x: freq  y: freq < B.T /  x: freq  y: freq D B.T 0 / ; yielding a contradiction to the assumption that T 0 represents an optimal preûx-free code for C 0 . Thus, T must represent an optimal preûx-free code for the alpha- bet C . Theorem 15.4 Procedure HUFFMAN produces an optimal preûx-free code. 15.3 Huffman codes 439 Proof Immediate from Lemmas 15.2 and 15.3. Exercises 15.3-1 Explain why, in the proof of Lemma 15.2, if x: freq D b: freq, then we must have a: freq D b: freq D x: freq D y: freq. 15.3-2 Prove that a non-full binary tree cannot correspond to an optimal preûx-free code. 15.3-3 What is an optimal Huffman code for the following set of frequencies, based on the ûrst 8 Fibonacci numbers? a:1 b:1 c:2 d:3 e:5 f:8 g:13 h:21 Can you generalize your answer to ûnd the optimal code when the frequencies are the ûrst n Fibonacci numbers? 15.3-4 Prove that the total cost B.T / of a full binary tree T for a code equals the sum, over all internal nodes, of the combined frequencies of the two children of the node. 15.3-5 Given an optimal preûx-free code on a set C of n characters, you wish to transmit the code itself using as few bits as possible. Show how to represent any optimal preûx-free code on C using only 2n  1 C n dlg ne bits. (Hint: Use 2n  1 bits to specify the structure of the tree, as discovered by a walk of the tree.) 15.3-6 Generalize Huffman’s algorithm to ternary codewords (i.e., codewords using the symbols 0, 1, and 2), and prove that it yields optimal ternary codes. 15.3-7 A data ûle contains a sequence of 8-bit characters such that all 256 characters are about equally common: the maximum character frequency is less than twice the minimum character frequency. Prove that Huffman coding in this case is no more efûcient than using an ordinary 8-bit ûxed-length code. 15.3-8 Show that no lossless (invertible) compression scheme can guarantee that for every input ûle, the corresponding output ûle is shorter. (Hint: Compare the number of possible ûles with the number of possible encoded ûles.) 440 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms 15.4 Ofüine caching Computer systems can decrease the time to access data by storing a subset of the main memory in the cache: a small but faster memory. A cache organizes data into cache blocks typically comprising 32, 64, or 128 bytes. You can also think of main memory as a cache for disk-resident data in a virtual-memory system. Here, the blocks are called pages, and 4096 bytes is a typical size. As a computer program executes, it makes a sequence of memory requests. Say that there are n memory requests, to data in blocks b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n , in that order. The blocks in the access sequence might not be distinct, and indeed, any given block is usually accessed multiple times. For example, a program that accesses four distinct blocks p; q; r; s might make a sequence of requests to blocks s; q; s; q; q; s; p; p; r; s; s; q; p; r; q. The cache can hold up to some ûxed number k of cache blocks. It starts out empty before the ûrst request. Each request causes at most one block to enter the cache and at most one block to be evicted from the cache. Upon a request for block b i , any one of three scenarios may occur: 1. Block b i is already in the cache, due to a previous request for the same block. The cache remains unchanged. This situation is known as a cache hit. 2. Block b i is not in the cache at that time, but the cache contains fewer than k blocks. In this case, block b i is placed into the cache, so that the cache contains one more block than it did before the request. 3. Block b i is not in the cache at that time and the cache is full: it contains k blocks. Block b i is placed into the cache, but before that happens, some other block in the cache must be evicted from the cache in order to make room. The latter two situations, in which the requested block is not already in the cache, are called cache misses. The goal is to minimize the number of cache misses or, equivalently, to maximize the number of cache hits, over the entire sequence of n requests. A cache miss that occurs while the cache holds fewer than k blocks4 that is, as the cache is ûrst being ûlled up4is known as a compulsory miss, since no prior decision could have kept the requested block in the cache. When a cache miss occurs and the cache is full, ideally the choice of which block to evict should allow for the smallest possible number of cache misses over the entire sequence of future requests. Typically, caching is an online problem. That is, the computer has to decide which blocks to keep in the cache without knowing the future requests. Here, however, let’s consider the ofüine version of this problem, in which the computer knows in advance the entire sequence of n requests and the cache size k, with a goal of minimizing the total number of cache misses. 15.4 Ofﬂine caching 441 To solve this ofüine problem, you can use a greedy strategy called furthest-in- future, which chooses to evict the block in the cache whose next access in the re- quest sequence comes furthest in the future. Intuitively, this strategy makes sense: if you’re not going to need something for a while, why keep it around? We’ll show that the furthest-in-future strategy is indeed optimal by showing that the ofüine caching problem exhibits optimal substructure and that furthest-in-future has the greedy-choice property. Now, you might be thinking that since the computer usually doesn’t know the sequence of requests in advance, there is no point in studying the ofüine problem. Actually, there is. In some situations, you do know the sequence of requests in advance. For example, if you view the main memory as the cache and the full set of data as residing on disk (or a solid-state drive), there are algorithms that plan out the entire set of reads and writes in advance. Furthermore, we can use the number of cache misses produced by an optimal algorithm as a baseline for comparing how well online algorithms perform. We’ll do just that in Section 27.3. Ofüine caching can even model real-world problems. For example, consider a scenario where you know in advance a ûxed schedule of n events at known loca- tions. Events may occur at a location multiple times, not necessarily consecutively. You are managing a group of k agents, you need to ensure that you have one agent at each location when an event occurs, and you want to minimize the number of times that agents have to move. Here, the agents are like the blocks, the events are like the requests, and moving an agent is akin to a cache miss. Optimal substructure of ofüine caching To show that the ofüine problem exhibits optimal substructure, let’s deûne the subproblem .C; i / as processing requests for blocks b i ; b i C1 ; : : : ; b n with cache conûguration C at the time that the request for block b i occurs, that is, C is a subset of the set of blocks such that jC j හ k. A solution to subproblem .C; i / is a sequence of decisions that speciûes which block to evict (if any) upon each request for blocks b i ; b i C1 ; : : : ; b n . An optimal solution to subproblem .C; i / minimizes the number of cache misses. Consider an optimal solution S to subproblem .C; i /, and let C 0 be the contents of the cache after processing the request for block b i in solution S . Let S 0 be the subsolution of S for the resulting subproblem .C 0 ; i C 1/. If the request for b i results in a cache hit, then the cache remains unchanged, so that C 0 D C . If the request for block b i results in a cache miss, then the contents of the cache change, so that C 0 ¤ C . We claim that in either case, S 0 is an optimal solution to subprob- lem .C 0 ; i C 1/. Why? If S 0 is not an optimal solution to subproblem .C 0 ; i C 1/, then there exists another solution S 00 to subproblem .C 0 ; i C 1/ that makes fewer cache misses than S 0 . Combining S 00 with the decision of S at the request for 442 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms block b i yields another solution that makes fewer cache misses than S , which con- tradicts the assumption that S is an optimal solution to subproblem .C; i /. To quantify a recursive solution, we need a little more notation. Let R C;i be the set of all cache conûgurations that can immediately follow conûguration C after processing a request for block b i . If the request results in a cache hit, then the cache remains unchanged, so that R C;i D fC g. If the request for b i results in a cache miss, then there are two possibilities. If the cache is not full (jC j < k), then the cache is ûlling up and the only choice is to insert b i into the cache, so that R C;i D fC [ fb i gg. If the cache is full (jC j D k) upon a cache miss, then R C;i contains k potential conûgurations: one for each candidate block in C that could be evicted and replaced by block b i . In this case, R C;i D f.C  fx g/ [ fb i g W x 2 C g. For example, if C D fp; q; r g, k D 3, and block s is requested, then R C;i D ffp; q; s g ; fp; r; s g ; fq; r; s gg. Let miss.C; i / denote the minimum number of cache misses in a solution for subproblem .C; i /. Here is a recurrence for miss.C; i /: miss.C; i / D „ 0 if i D n and b n 2 C ; 1 if i D n and b n 62 C ; miss.C; i C 1/ if i < n and b i 2 C ; 1 C min fmiss.C 0 ; i C 1/ W C 0 2 R C;i g if i < n and b i 62 C : Greedy-choice property To prove that the furthest-in-future strategy yields an optimal solution, we need to show that optimal ofüine caching exhibits the greedy-choice property. Combined with the optimal-substructure property, the greedy-choice property will prove that furthest-in-future produces the minimum possible number of cache misses. Theorem 15.5 (Optimal ofüine caching has the greedy-choice property) Consider a subproblem .C; i / when the cache C contains k blocks, so that it is full, and a cache miss occurs. When block b i is requested, let ´ D b m be the block in C whose next access is furthest in the future. (If some block in the cache will never again be referenced, then consider any such block to be block ´, and add a dummy request for block ´ D b m D b nC1 .) Then evicting block ´ upon a request for block b i is included in some optimal solution for the subproblem .C; i /. Proof Let S be an optimal solution to subproblem .C; i /. If S evicts block ´ upon the request for block b i , then we are done, since we have shown that some optimal solution includes evicting ´. So now suppose that optimal solution S evicts some other block x when block b i is requested. We’ll construct another solution S 0 to subproblem .C; i / which, upon 15.4 Ofﬂine caching 443 the request for b i , evicts block ´ instead of x and induces no more cache misses than S does, so that S 0 is also optimal. Because different solutions may yield different cache conûgurations, denote by C S;j the conûguration of the cache under solution S just before the request for some block b j , and likewise for solution S 0 and C S 0 ;j . We’ll show how to construct S 0 with the following properties: 1. For j D i C 1; : : : ; m, let D j D C S;j \\ C S 0 ;j . Then, jD j j  k  1, so that the cache conûgurations C S;j and C S 0 ;j differ by at most one block. If they differ, then C S;j D D j [ f´g and C S 0 ;j D D j [ fy g for some block y ¤ ´. 2. For each request of blocks b i ; : : : ; b m1 , if solution S has a cache hit, then solution S 0 also has a cache hit. 3. For all j > m, the cache conûgurations C S;j and C S 0 ;j are identical. 4. Over the sequence of requests for blocks b i ; : : : ; b m , the number of cache misses produced by solution S 0 is at most the number of cache misses produced by so- lution S . We’ll prove inductively that these properties hold for each request. 1. We proceed by induction on j , for j D i C 1; : : : ; m. For the base case, the ini- tial caches C S;i and C S 0 ;i are identical. Upon the request for block b i , solution S evicts x and solution S 0 evicts ´. Thus, cache conûgurations C S;i C1 and C S 0 ;i C1 differ by just one block, C S;i C1 D D i C1 [ f´g, C S 0 ;i C1 D D i C1 [ fx g, and x ¤ ´. The inductive step deûnes how solution S 0 behaves upon a request for block b j for i C 1 හ j හ m  1. The inductive hypothesis is that property 1 holds when b j is requested. Because ´ D b m is the block in C S;i whose next reference is furthest in the future, we know that b j ¤ ´. We consider several scenarios:  If C S;j D C S 0 ;j (so that jD j j D k), then solution S 0 makes the same decision upon the request for b j as S makes, so that C S;j C1 D C S 0 ;j C1 .  If jD j j D k  1 and b j 2 D j , then both caches already contain block b j , and both solutions S and S 0 have cache hits. Therefore, C S;j C1 D C S;j and C S 0 ;j C1 D C S 0 ;j .  If jD j j D k  1 and b j … D j , then because C S;j D D j [ f´g and b j ¤ ´, solution S has a cache miss. It evicts either block ´ or some block w 2 D j . B If solution S evicts block ´, then C S;j C1 D D j [ fb j g. There are two cases, depending on whether b j D y : ˘ If b j D y , then solution S 0 has a cache hit, so that C S 0 ;j C1 D C S 0 ;j D D j [ fb j g. Thus, C S;j C1 D C S 0 ;j C1 . ˘ If b j ¤ y , then solution S 0 has a cache miss. It evicts block y , so that C S 0 ;j C1 D D j [ fb j g, and again C S;j C1 D C S 0 ;j C1 . 444 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms B If solution S evicts some block w 2 D j , then C S;j C1 D .D j  fwg/ [ fb j ; ´g. Once again, there are two cases, depending on whether b j D y : ˘ If b j D y , then solution S 0 has a cache hit, so that C S 0 ;j C1 D C S 0 ;j D D j [ fb j g. Since w 2 D j and w was not evicted by solu- tion S 0 , we have w 2 C S 0 ;j C1 . Therefore, w … D j C1 and b j 2 D j C1 , so that D j C1 D .D j  fwg/ [ fb j g. Thus, C S;j C1 D D j C1 [ f´g, C S 0 ;j C1 D D j C1 [ fwg, and because w ¤ ´, property 1 holds when block b j C1 is requested. (In other words, block w replaces block y in property 1.) ˘ If b j ¤ y , then solution S 0 has a cache miss. It evicts block w, so that C S 0 ;j C1 D .D j  fwg/ [ fb j ; y g. Therefore, we have that D j C1 D .D j  fwg/ [ fb j g and so C S;j C1 D D j C1 [ f´g and C S 0 ;j C1 D D j C1 [ fy g. 2. In the above discussion about maintaining property 1, solution S may have a cache hit in only the ûrst two cases, and solution S 0 has a cache hit in these cases if and only if S does. 3. If C S;m D C S 0 ;m , then solution S 0 makes the same decision upon the request for block ´ D b m as S makes, so that C S;mC1 D C S 0 ;mC1 . If C S;m ¤ C S 0 ;m , then by property 1, C S;m D D m [f´g and C S 0 ;m D D m [fy g, where y ¤ ´. In this case, solution S has a cache hit, so that C S;mC1 D C S;m D D m [ f´g. Solution S 0 evicts block y and brings in block ´, so that C S 0 ;mC1 D D m [ f´g D C S;mC1 . Thus, regardless of whether or not C S;m D C S 0 ;m , we have C S;mC1 D C S 0 ;mC1 , and starting with the request for block b mC1 , solution S 0 simply makes the same decisions as S . 4. By property 2, upon the requests for blocks b i ; : : : ; b m1 , whenever solution S has a cache hit, so does S 0 . Only the request for block b m D ´ remains to be considered. If S has a cache miss upon the request for b m , then regardless of whether S 0 has a cache hit or a cache miss, we are done: S 0 has at most the same number of cache misses as S . So now suppose that S has a cache hit and S 0 has a cache miss upon the re- quest for b m . We’ll show that there exists a request for at least one of blocks b i C1 ; : : : ; b m1 in which the request results in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S 0 , thereby compensating for what happens upon the request for block b m . The proof is by contradiction. Assume that no request for blocks b i C1 ; : : : ; b m1 results in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S 0 . We start by observing that once the caches C S;j and C S 0 j are equal for some j > i , they remain equal thereafter. Observe also that if b m 2 C S;m and b m … C S 0 ;m , then C S;m ¤ C S 0 ;m . Therefore, solution S cannot have evicted block ´ upon the requests for blocks b i ; : : : ; b m1 , for if it had, then these two 15.4 Ofﬂine caching 445 cache conûgurations would be equal. The remaining possibility is that upon each of these requests, we had C S;j D D j [ f´g, C S 0 ;j D D j [ fy g for some block y ¤ ´, and solution S evicted some block w 2 D j . Moreover, since none of these requests resulted in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S 0 , the case of b j D y never occurred. That is, for every request of blocks b i C1 ; : : : ; b m1 , the requested block b j was never the block y 2 C S 0 ;j  C S;j . In these cases, after processing the request, we had C S 0 ;j C1 D D j C1 [ fy g: the difference between the two caches did not change. Now, let’s go back to the request for block b i , where afterward, we had C S 0 ;i C1 D D i C1 [ fx g. Because every succeeding request until requesting block b m did not change the difference between the caches, we had C S 0 ;j D D j [ fx g for j D i C 1; : : : ; m. By deûnition, block ´ D b m is requested after block x . That means at least one of blocks b i C1 ; : : : ; b m1 is block x . But for j D i C 1; : : : ; m, we have x 2 C S 0 ;j and x … C S;j , so that at least one of these requests had a cache hit for S 0 and a cache miss for S , a contradiction. We conclude that if solution S has a cache hit and solution S 0 has a cache miss upon the request for block b m , then some earlier request had the opposite result, and so solution S 0 produces no more cache misses than solution S . Since S is assumed to be optimal, S 0 is optimal as well. Along with the optimal-substructure property, Theorem 15.5 tells us that the furthest-in-future strategy yields the minimum number of cache misses. Exercises 15.4-1 Write pseudocode for a cache manager that uses the furthest-in-future strategy. It should take as input a set C of blocks in the cache, the number of blocks k that the cache can hold, a sequence b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n of requested blocks, and the index i into the sequence for the block b i being requested. For each request, it should print out whether a cache hit or cache miss occurs, and for each cache miss, it should also print out which block, if any, is evicted. 15.4-2 Real cache managers do not know the future requests, and so they often use the past to decide which block to evict. The least-recently-used, or LRU, strategy evicts the block that, of all blocks currently in the cache, was the least recently requested. (You can think of LRU as <furthest-in-past.=) Give an example of a request sequence in which the LRU strategy is not optimal, by showing that it induces more cache misses than the furthest-in-future strategy does on the same request sequence. 446 Chapter 15 Greedy Algorithms 15.4-3 Professor Croesus suggests that in the proof of Theorem 15.5, the last clause in property 1 can change to C S 0 ;j D D j [ fx g or, equivalently, require the block y given in property 1 to always be the block x evicted by solution S upon the request for block b i . Show where the proof breaks down with this requirement. 15.4-4 This section has assumed that at most one block is placed into the cache whenever a block is requested. You can imagine, however, a strategy in which multiple blocks may enter the cache upon a single request. Show that for every solution that allows multiple blocks to enter the cache upon each request, there is another solution that brings in only one block upon each request and is at least as good. Problems 15-1 Coin changing Consider the problem of making change for n cents using the smallest number of coins. Assume that each coin’s value is an integer. a. Describe a greedy algorithm to make change consisting of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Prove that your algorithm yields an optimal solution. b. Suppose that the available coins are in denominations that are powers of c : the denominations are c 0 ; c 1 ; : : : ; c k for some integers c > 1 and k  1. Show that the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution. c. Give a set of coin denominations for which the greedy algorithm does not yield an optimal solution. Your set should include a penny so that there is a solution for every value of n. d. Give an O.nk/-time algorithm that makes change for any set of k different coin denominations using the smallest number of coins, assuming that one of the coins is a penny. 15-2 Scheduling to minimize average completion time You are given a set S D fa 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n g of tasks, where task a i requires p i units of processing time to complete. Let C i be the completion time of task a i , that is, the time at which task a i completes processing. Your goal is to minimize the average completion time, that is, to minimize .1=n/ P n i D1 C i . For example, suppose that there are two tasks a 1 and a 2 with p 1 D 3 and p 2 D 5, and consider the schedule Notes for Chapter 15 447 in which a 2 runs ûrst, followed by a 1 . Then we have C 2 D 5, C 1 D 8, and the average completion time is .5 C 8/=2 D 6:5. If task a 1 runs ûrst, however, then we have C 1 D 3, C 2 D 8, and the average completion time is .3 C 8/=2 D 5:5. a. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the average com- pletion time. Each task must run nonpreemptively, that is, once task a i starts, it must run continuously for p i units of time until it is done. Prove that your al- gorithm minimizes the average completion time, and analyze the running time of your algorithm. b. Suppose now that the tasks are not all available at once. That is, each task cannot start until its release time b i . Suppose also that tasks may be preempted, so that a task can be suspended and restarted at a later time. For example, a task a i with processing time p i D 6 and release time b i D 1 might start running at time 1 and be preempted at time 4. It might then resume at time 10 but be preempted at time 11, and it might ûnally resume at time 13 and complete at time 15. Task a i has run for a total of 6 time units, but its running time has been divided into three pieces. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the average completion time in this new scenario. Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and analyze the running time of your algorithm. Chapter notes Much more material on greedy algorithms can be found in Lawler [276] and Pa- padimitriou and Steiglitz [353]. The greedy algorithm ûrst appeared in the combi- natorial optimization literature in a 1971 article by Edmonds [131]. The proof of correctness of the greedy algorithm for the activity-selection prob- lem is based on that of Gavril [179]. Huffman codes were invented in 1952 [233]. Lelewer and Hirschberg [294] surveys data-compression techniques known as of 1987. The furthest-in-future strategy was proposed by Belady [41], who suggested it for virtual-memory systems. Alternative proofs that furthest-in-future is optimal appear in articles by Lee et al. [284] and Van Roy [443]. 16 Amortized Analysis Imagine that you join Buff’s Gym. Buff charges a membership fee of $60 per month, plus $3 for every time you use the gym. Because you are disciplined, you visit Buff’s Gym every day during the month of November. On top of the $60 monthly charge for November, you pay another 3  $30 D $90 that month. Although you can think of your fees as a üat fee of $60 and another $90 in daily fees, you can think about it in another way. All together, you pay $150 over 30 days, or an average of $5 per day. When you look at your fees in this way, you are amortizing the monthly fee over the 30 days of the month, spreading it out at $2 per day. You can do the same thing when you analyze running times. In an amortized analysis, you average the time required to perform a sequence of data-structure operations over all the operations performed. With amortized analysis, you show that if you average over a sequence of operations, then the average cost of an oper- ation is small, even though a single operation within the sequence might be expen- sive. Amortized analysis differs from average-case analysis in that probability is not involved. An amortized analysis guarantees the average performance of each operation in the worst case. The ûrst three sections of this chapter cover the three most common techniques used in amortized analysis. Section 16.1 starts with aggregate analysis, in which you determine an upper bound T .n/ on the total cost of a sequence of n operations. The average cost per operation is then T .n/=n. You take the average cost as the amortized cost of each operation, so that all operations have the same amortized cost. Section 16.2 covers the accounting method, in which you determine an amor- tized cost of each operation. When there is more than one type of operation, each type of operation may have a different amortized cost. The accounting method overcharges some operations early in the sequence, storing the overcharge as <pre- 16.1 Aggregate analysis 449 paid credit= on speciûc objects in the data structure. Later in the sequence, the credit pays for operations that are charged less than they actually cost. Section 16.3 discusses the potential method, which is like the accounting method in that you determine the amortized cost of each operation and may overcharge op- erations early on to compensate for undercharges later. The potential method main- tains the credit as the <potential energy= of the data structure as a whole instead of associating the credit with individual objects within the data structure. We’ll use use two examples in this chapter to examine each of these three meth- ods. One is a stack with the additional operation MULTIPOP, which pops several objects at once. The other is a binary counter that counts up from 0 by means of the single operation I NCREMENT. While reading this chapter, bear in mind that the charges assigned during an amortized analysis are for analysis purposes only. They need not4and should not 4appear in the code. If, for example, you assign a credit to an object x when using the accounting method, you have no need to assign an appropriate amount to some attribute, such as x: credit , in the code. When you perform an amortized analysis, you often gain insight into a particular data structure, and this insight can help you optimize the design. For example, Section 16.4 will use the potential method to analyze a dynamically expanding and contracting table. 16.1 Aggregate analysis In aggregate analysis, you show that for all n, a sequence of n operations takes T .n/ worst-case time in total. In the worst case, the average cost, or amortized cost, per operation is therefore T .n/=n. This amortized cost applies to each operation, even when there are several types of operations in the sequence. The other two methods we shall study in this chapter, the accounting method and the potential method, may assign different amortized costs to different types of operations. Stack operations As the ûrst example of aggregate analysis, let’s analyze stacks that have been aug- mented with a new operation. Section 10.1.3 presented the two fundamental stack operations, each of which takes O.1/ time: PUSH.S; x/ pushes object x onto stack S . POP.S/ pops the top of stack S and returns the popped object. Calling POP on an empty stack generates an error. 450 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis 23 17 6 39 10 47 (a) top 10 47 (b) top (c) Figure 16.1 The action of MULTIPOP on a stack S , shown initially in (a). The top 4 objects are popped by MULTIPOP.S; 4/, whose result is shown in (b). The next operation is M ULTIPOP.S; 7/, which empties the stack4shown in (c)4since fewer than 7 objects remained. Since each of these operations runs in O.1/ time, let us consider the cost of each to be 1. The total cost of a sequence of n PUSH and POP operations is therefore n, and the actual running time for n operations is therefore ‚.n/. Now let’s add the stack operation MULTIPOP .S; k/, which removes the k top ob- jects of stack S , popping the entire stack if the stack contains fewer than k objects. Of course, the procedure assumes that k is positive, and otherwise, the MULTIPOP operation leaves the stack unchanged. In the pseudocode for M ULTIPOP, the op- eration STAC K-EMPTY returns TRUE if there are no objects currently on the stack, and FALSE otherwise. Figure 16.1 shows an example of MULTIPOP. MULTIPOP .S; k/ 1 while not STAC K-EMPTY .S/ and k > 0 2 POP.S/ 3 k D k  1 What is the running time of MULTIPOP .S; k/ on a stack of s objects? The actual running time is linear in the number of POP operations actually executed, and thus we can analyze MULTIPOP in terms of the abstract costs of 1 each for PUSH and POP. The number of iterations of the while loop is the number min fs; kg of objects popped off the stack. Each iteration of the loop makes one call to P OP in line 2. Thus, the total cost of MULTIPOP is min fs; kg, and the actual running time is a linear function of this cost. Now let’s analyze a sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an initially empty stack. The worst-case cost of a MULTIPOP operation in the sequence is O.n/, since the stack size is at most n. The worst-case time of any stack operation is therefore O.n/, and hence a sequence of n operations costs O.n 2 /, since the sequence contains at most n MULTIPOP operations costing O.n/ each. 16.1 Aggregate analysis 451 Although this analysis is correct, the O.n 2 / result, which came from considering the worst-case cost of each operation individually, is not tight. Yes, a single MULTIPOP might be expensive, but an aggregate analysis shows that any sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations on an initially empty stack has an upper bound on its cost of O.n/. Why? An object cannot be popped from the stack unless it was ûrst pushed. Therefore, the number of times that POP can be called on a nonempty stack, including calls within M ULTIPOP, is at most the number of PUSH operations, which is at most n. For any value of n, any sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations takes a total of O.n/ time. Averaging over the n operations gives an average cost per operation of O.n/=n D O.1/. Aggregate analysis assigns the amortized cost of each operation to be the average cost. In this example, therefore, all three stack operations have an amortized cost of O.1/. To recap: although the average cost, and hence the running time, of a stack operation is O.1/, the analysis did not rely on probabilistic reasoning. Instead, the analysis yielded a worst-case bound of O.n/ on a sequence of n operations. Dividing this total cost by n yielded that the average cost per operation4that is, the amortized cost4is O.1/. Incrementing a binary counter As another example of aggregate analysis, consider the problem of implementing a k-bit binary counter that counts upward from 0. An array AŒ0 W k  1� of bits rep- resents the counter. A binary number x that is stored in the counter has its lowest- order bit in AŒ0� and its highest-order bit in AŒk  1�, so that x D P k1 i D0 AŒi �  2 i . Initially, x D 0, and thus AŒi � D 0 for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1. To add 1 (modulo 2 k ) to the value in the counter, call the I NCREMENT procedure. I NCREMENT.A; k/ 1 i D 0 2 while i < k and AŒi � == 1 3 AŒi � D 0 4 i D i C 1 5 if i < k 6 AŒi � D 1 Figure 16.2 shows what happens to a binary counter when I NCREMENT is called 16 times, starting with the initial value 0 and ending with the value 16. Each iteration of the while loop in lines 234 adds a 1 into position i . If AŒi � D 1, then adding 1 üips the bit to 0 in position i and yields a carry of 1, to be added into 452 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 7 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 10 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 11 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 12 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 13 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 14 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 15 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 16 A [ 0 ] A [ 1 ] A [ 2 ] A [ 3 ] A [ 4 ] A [ 5 ] A [ 6 ] A [ 7 ] Counter value Total cost 1 3 4 7 8 10 11 15 16 18 19 22 25 26 31 0 Figure 16.2 An 8-bit binary counter as its value goes from 0 to 16 by a sequence of 16 I NCREMENT operations. Bits that üip to achieve the next value are shaded in blue. The running cost for üipping bits is shown at the right. The total cost is always less than twice the total number of I NCREMENT operations. position i C 1 during the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the loop ends, and then, if i < k, AŒi � must be 0, so that line 6 adds a 1 into position i , üipping the 0 to a 1. If the loop ends with i D k, then the call of I NCREMENT üipped all k bits from 1 to 0. The cost of each I NCREMENT operation is linear in the number of bits üipped. As with the stack example, a cursory analysis yields a bound that is correct but not tight. A single execution of I NCREMENT takes ‚.k/ time in the worst case, in which all the bits in array A are 1. Thus, a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter takes O.nk/ time in the worst case. Although a single call of I NCREMENT might üip all k bits, not all bits üip upon each call. (Note the similarity to MULTIPOP, where a single call might pop many objects, but not every call pops many objects.) As Figure 16.2 shows, AŒ0� does üip each time I NCREMENT is called. The next bit up, AŒ1�, üips only every other time: a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter causes AŒ1� to üip bn=2c times. Similarly, bit AŒ2� üips only every fourth time, or bn=4c times in a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations. In general, for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1, bit AŒi � üips bn=2 i c times in a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter. For i  k, bit AŒi � does not exist, and so it cannot üip. The total number 16.2 The accounting method 453 of üips in the sequence is thus k1 X i D0 j n 2 i k < n 1 X i D0 1 2 i D 2n ; by equation (A.7) on page 1142. Thus, a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations on an initially zero counter takes O.n/ time in the worst case. The average cost of each operation, and therefore the amortized cost per operation, is O.n/=n D O.1/. Exercises 16.1-1 If the set of stack operations includes a MULTIPUSH operation, which pushes k items onto the stack, does the O.1/ bound on the amortized cost of stack operations continue to hold? 16.1-2 Show that if a DECREMENT operation is included in the k-bit counter example, n operations can cost as much as ‚.nk/ time. 16.1-3 Use aggregate analysis to determine the amortized cost per operation for a sequence of n operations on a data structure in which the i th operation costs i if i is an exact power of 2, and 1 otherwise. 16.2 The accounting method In the accounting method of amortized analysis, you assign differing charges to different operations, with some operations charged more or less than they actu- ally cost. The amount that you charge an operation is its amortized cost. When an operation’s amortized cost exceeds its actual cost, you assign the difference to speciûc objects in the data structure as credit. Credit can help pay for later oper- ations whose amortized cost is less than their actual cost. Thus, you can view the amortized cost of an operation as being split between its actual cost and credit that is either deposited or used up. Different operations may have different amortized costs. This method differs from aggregate analysis, in which all operations have the same amortized cost. You must choose the amortized costs of operations carefully. If you want to use amortized costs to show that in the worst case the average cost per operation is 454 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis small, you must ensure that the total amortized cost of a sequence of operations provides an upper bound on the total actual cost of the sequence. Moreover, as in aggregate analysis, the upper bound must apply to all sequences of operations. Let’s denote the actual cost of the i th operation by c i and the amortized cost of the i th operation by y c i . Then you need to have n X i D1 y c i  n X i D1 c i (16.1) for all sequences of n operations. The total credit stored in the data structure is the difference between the total amortized cost and the total actual cost, or P n i D1 y c i  P n i D1 c i . By inequality (16.1), the total credit associated with the data structure must be nonnegative at all times. If you ever allowed the total credit to become negative (the result of undercharging early operations with the promise of repaying the account later on), then the total amortized costs incurred at that time would be below the total actual costs incurred. In that case, for the sequence of operations up to that time, the total amortized cost would not be an upper bound on the total actual cost. Thus, you must take care that the total credit in the data structure never becomes negative. Stack operations To illustrate the accounting method of amortized analysis, we return to the stack example. Recall that the actual costs of the operations were PUSH 1 , POP 1 , MULTIPOP min fs; kg , where k is the argument supplied to MULTIPOP and s is the stack size when it is called. Let us assign the following amortized costs: PUSH 2 , POP 0 , MULTIPOP 0 . The amortized cost of MULTIPOP is a constant (0), whereas the actual cost is vari- able, and thus all three amortized costs are constant. In general, the amortized costs of the operations under consideration may differ from each other, and they may even differ asymptotically. Now let’s see how to pay for any sequence of stack operations by charging the amortized costs. Let $1 represent each unit of cost. At ûrst, the stack is empty. Recall the analogy of Section 10.1.3 between the stack data structure and a stack of plates in a cafeteria. Upon pushing a plate onto the stack, use $1 to pay the 16.2 The accounting method 455 actual cost of the push, leaving a credit of $1 (out of the $2 charged). Place that $1 of credit on top of the plate. At any point in time, every plate on the stack has $1 of credit on it. The $1 stored on the plate serves to prepay the cost of popping the plate from the stack. A POP operation incurs no charge: pay the actual cost of popping a plate by taking the $1 of credit off the plate. Thus, by charging the P USH operation a little bit more, we can view the POP operation as free. Moreover, the MULTIPOP operation also incurs no charge, since it’s just repeated POP operations, each of which is free. If a MULTIPOP operation pops k plates, then the actual cost is paid by the k dollars stored on the k plates. Because each plate on the stack has $1 of credit on it, and the stack always has a nonnegative number of plates, the amount of credit is always nonnegative. Thus, for any sequence of n PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP operations, the total amortized cost is an upper bound on the total actual cost. Since the total amortized cost is O.n/, so is the total actual cost. Incrementing a binary counter As another illustration of the accounting method, let’s analyze the I NCREMENT operation on a binary counter that starts at 0. Recall that the running time of this operation is proportional to the number of bits üipped, which serves as the cost for this example. Again, we’ll use $1 to represent each unit of cost (the üipping of a bit in this example). For the amortized analysis, the amortized cost to set a 0-bit to 1 is $2. When a bit is set to 1, $1 of the $2 pays to actually set the bit. The second $1 resides on the bit as credit to be used later if and when the bit is reset to 0. At any point in time, every 1-bit in the counter has $1 of credit on it, and thus resetting a bit to 0 can be viewed as costing nothing, and the $1 on the bit prepays for the reset. Here is how to determine the amortized cost of I NCREMENT. The cost of reset- ting the bits to 0 within the while loop is paid for by the dollars on the bits that are reset. The I NCREMENT procedure sets at most one bit to 1, in line 6, and there- fore the amortized cost of an I NCREMENT operation is at most $2. The number of 1-bits in the counter never becomes negative, and thus the amount of credit stays nonnegative at all times. Thus, for n I NCREMENT operations, the total amortized cost is O.n/, which bounds the total actual cost. Exercises 16.2-1 You perform a sequence of P USH and POP operations on a stack whose size never exceeds k. After every k operations, a copy of the entire stack is made automat- 456 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis ically, for backup purposes. Show that the cost of n stack operations, including copying the stack, is O.n/ by assigning suitable amortized costs to the various stack operations. 16.2-2 Redo Exercise 16.1-3 using an accounting method of analysis. 16.2-3 You wish not only to increment a counter but also to reset it to 0 (i.e., make all bits in it 0). Counting the time to examine or modify a bit as ‚.1/, show how to implement a counter as an array of bits so that any sequence of n I NCREMENT and RESET operations takes O.n/ time on an initially zero counter. (Hint: Keep a pointer to the high-order 1.) 16.3 The potential method Instead of representing prepaid work as credit stored with speciûc objects in the data structure, the potential method of amortized analysis represents the prepaid work as <potential energy,= or just <potential,= which can be released to pay for future operations. The potential applies to the data structure as a whole rather than to speciûc objects within the data structure. The potential method works as follows. Starting with an initial data structure D 0 , a sequence of n operations occurs. For each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, let c i be the actual cost of the i th operation and D i be the data structure that results after applying the i th operation to data structure D i 1 . A potential function ˆ maps each data structure D i to a real number ˆ.D i /, which is the potential associated with D i . The amortized cost y c i of the i th operation with respect to potential function ˆ is deûned by y c i D c i C ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / : (16.2) The amortized cost of each operation is therefore its actual cost plus the change in potential due to the operation. By equation (16.2), the total amortized cost of the n operations is n X i D1 y c i D n X i D1 .c i C ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 // D n X i D1 c i C ˆ.D n /  ˆ.D 0 / : (16.3) 16.3 The potential method 457 The second equation follows from equation (A.12) on page 1143 because the ˆ.D i / terms telescope. If you can deûne a potential function ˆ so that ˆ.D n /  ˆ.D 0 /, then the total amortized cost P n i D1 y c i gives an upper bound on the total actual cost P n i D1 c i . In practice, you don’t always know how many operations might be performed. Therefore, if you require that ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D 0 / for all i , then you guarantee, as in the accounting method, that you’ve paid in advance. It’s usually simplest to just deûne ˆ.D 0 / to be 0 and then show that ˆ.D i /  0 for all i . (See Exercise 16.3-1 for an easy way to handle cases in which ˆ.D 0 / ¤ 0.) Intuitively, if the potential difference ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / of the i th operation is positive, then the amortized cost y c i represents an overcharge to the i th operation, and the potential of the data structure increases. If the potential difference is neg- ative, then the amortized cost represents an undercharge to the i th operation, and the decrease in the potential pays for the actual cost of the operation. The amortized costs deûned by equations (16.2) and (16.3) depend on the choice of the potential function ˆ. Different potential functions may yield different amor- tized costs, yet still be upper bounds on the actual costs. You will often ûnd trade- offs that you can make in choosing a potential function. The best potential function to use depends on the desired time bounds. Stack operations To illustrate the potential method, we return once again to the example of the stack operations PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP. We deûne the potential function ˆ on a stack to be the number of objects in the stack. The potential of the empty initial stack D 0 is ˆ.D 0 / D 0. Since the number of objects in the stack is never negative, the stack D i that results after the i th operation has nonnegative potential, and thus ˆ.D i /  0 D ˆ.D 0 / : The total amortized cost of n operations with respect to ˆ therefore represents an upper bound on the actual cost. Now let’s compute the amortized costs of the various stack operations. If the i th operation on a stack containing s objects is a PUSH operation, then the potential difference is ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / D .s C 1/  s D 1 : By equation (16.2), the amortized cost of this PUSH operation is 458 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis y c i D c i C ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / D 1 C 1 D 2 : Suppose that the i th operation on the stack of s objects is MULTIPOP .S; k/, which causes k 0 D min fs; kg objects to be popped off the stack. The actual cost of the operation is k 0 , and the potential difference is ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / D k 0 : Thus, the amortized cost of the MULTIPOP operation is y c i D c i C ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / D k 0  k 0 D 0 : Similarly, the amortized cost of an ordinary POP operation is 0. The amortized cost of each of the three operations is O.1/, and thus the total amortized cost of a sequence of n operations is O.n/. Since ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D 0 /, the total amortized cost of n operations is an upper bound on the total actual cost. The worst-case cost of n operations is therefore O.n/. Incrementing a binary counter As another example of the potential method, we revisit incrementing a k-bit binary counter. This time, the potential of the counter after the i th I NCREMENT operation is deûned to be the number of 1-bits in the counter after the i th operation, which we’ll denote by b i . Here is how to compute the amortized cost of an I NCREMENT operation. Sup- pose that the i th I NCREMENT operation resets t i bits to 0. The actual cost c i of the operation is therefore at most t i C 1, since in addition to resetting t i bits, it sets at most one bit to 1. If b i D 0, then the i th operation had reset all k bits to 0, and so b i 1 D t i D k. If b i > 0, then b i D b i 1  t i C 1. In either case, b i හ b i 1  t i C 1, and the potential difference is ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / හ .b i 1  t i C 1/  b i 1 D 1  t i : The amortized cost is therefore y c i D c i C ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D i 1 / හ .t i C 1/ C .1  t i / D 2 : 16.3 The potential method 459 If the counter starts at 0, then ˆ.D 0 / D 0. Since ˆ.D i /  0 for all i , the total amortized cost of a sequence of n I NCREMENT operations is an upper bound on the total actual cost, and so the worst-case cost of n I NCREMENT operations is O.n/. The potential method provides a simple and clever way to analyze the counter even when it does not start at 0. The counter starts with b 0 1-bits, and after n I NCREMENT operations it has b n 1-bits, where 0 හ b 0 ; b n හ k. Rewrite equa- tion (16.3) as n X i D1 c i D n X i D1 y c i  ˆ.D n / C ˆ.D 0 / : Since ˆ.D 0 / D b 0 , ˆ.D n / D b n , and y c i හ 2 for all 1 හ i හ n, the total actual cost of n I NCREMENT operations is n X i D1 c i හ n X i D1 2  b n C b 0 D 2n  b n C b 0 : In particular, b 0 හ k means that as long as k D O.n/, the total actual cost is O.n/. In other words, if at least n D �.k/ I NCREMENT operations occur, the total actual cost is O.n/, no matter what initial value the counter contains. Exercises 16.3-1 Suppose you have a potential function ˆ such that ˆ.D i /  ˆ.D 0 / for all i , but ˆ.D 0 / ¤ 0. Show that there exists a potential function ˆ 0 such that ˆ 0 .D 0 / D 0, ˆ 0 .D i /  0 for all i  1, and the amortized costs using ˆ 0 are the same as the amortized costs using ˆ. 16.3-2 Redo Exercise 16.1-3 using a potential method of analysis. 16.3-3 Consider an ordinary binary min-heap data structure supporting the instructions I NSERT and EXTRACT-MIN that, when there are n items in the heap, implements each operation in O.lg n/ worst-case time. Give a potential function ˆ such that the amortized cost of I NSERT is O.lg n/ and the amortized cost of EXTRACT-MIN is O.1/, and show that your potential function yields these amortized time bounds. Note that in the analysis, n is the number of items currently in the heap, and you do not know a bound on the maximum number of items that can ever be stored in the heap. 460 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis 16.3-4 What is the total cost of executing n of the stack operations PUSH, POP, and MULTIPOP , assuming that the stack begins with s 0 objects and ûnishes with s n objects? 16.3-5 Show how to implement a queue with two ordinary stacks (Exercise 10.1-7) so that the amortized cost of each E NQUEUE and each DEQUEUE operation is O.1/. 16.3-6 Design a data structure to support the following two operations for a dynamic multiset S of integers, which allows duplicate values: I NSERT.S; x/ inserts x into S . DELETE-LARGER-HALF .S/ deletes the largest djS j =2e elements from S . Explain how to implement this data structure so that any sequence of m I NSERT and DELETE-LARGER-HALF operations runs in O.m/ time. Your implementation should also include a way to output the elements of S in O.jS j/ time. 16.4 Dynamic tables When you design an application that uses a table, you do not always know in advance how many items the table will hold. You might allocate space for the table, only to ûnd out later that it is not enough. The program must then reallocate the table with a larger size and copy all items stored in the original table over into the new, larger table. Similarly, if many items have been deleted from the table, it might be worthwhile to reallocate the table with a smaller size. This section studies this problem of dynamically expanding and contracting a table. Amortized analyses will show that the amortized cost of insertion and deletion is only O.1/, even though the actual cost of an operation is large when it triggers an expansion or a contraction. Moreover, you’ll see how to guarantee that the unused space in a dynamic table never exceeds a constant fraction of the total space. Let’s assume that the dynamic table supports the operations TABLE-I NSERT and TABLE-DELETE. TABLE-I NSERT inserts into the table an item that occupies a sin- gle slot, that is, a space for one item. Likewise, TABLE-DELETE removes an item from the table, thereby freeing a slot. The details of the data-structuring method used to organize the table are unimportant: it could be a stack (Section 10.1.3), a heap (Chapter 6), a hash table (Chapter 11), or something else. 16.4 Dynamic tables 461 It is convenient to use a concept introduced in Section 11.2, where we analyzed hashing. The load factor ˛.T / of a nonempty table T is deûned as the number of items stored in the table divided by the size (number of slots) of the table. An empty table (one with no slots) has size 0, and its load factor is deûned to be 1. If the load factor of a dynamic table is bounded below by a constant, the unused space in the table is never more than a constant fraction of the total amount of space. We start by analyzing a dynamic table that allows only insertion and then move on to the more general case that supports both insertion and deletion. 16.4.1 Table expansion Let’s assume that storage for a table is allocated as an array of slots. A table ûlls up when all slots have been used or, equivalently, when its load factor is 1. 1 In some software environments, upon an attempt to insert an item into a full table, the only alternative is to abort with an error. The scenario in this section assumes, how- ever, that the software environment, like many modern ones, provides a memory- management system that can allocate and free blocks of storage on request. Thus, upon inserting an item into a full table, the system can expand the table by allo- cating a new table with more slots than the old table had. Because the table must always reside in contiguous memory, the system must allocate a new array for the larger table and then copy items from the old table into the new table. A common heuristic allocates a new table with twice as many slots as the old one. If the only table operations are insertions, then the load factor of the table is always at least 1=2, and thus the amount of wasted space never exceeds half the total space in the table. The TABLE-I NSERT procedure on the following page assumes that T is an object representing the table. The attribute T: table contains a pointer to the block of storage representing the table, T: num contains the number of items in the table, and T: size gives the total number of slots in the table. Initially, the table is empty: T: num D T: size D 0. There are two types of insertion here: the TABLE-I NSERT procedure itself and the elementary insertion into a table in lines 6 and 10. We can analyze the running time of TABLE-I NSERT in terms of the number of elementary insertions by assign- ing a cost of 1 to each elementary insertion. In most computing environments, the overhead for allocating an initial table in line 2 is constant and the overhead for allocating and freeing storage in lines 5 and 7 is dominated by the cost of transfer- 1 In some situations, such as an open-address hash table, it’s better to consider a table to be full if its load factor equals some constant strictly less than 1. (See Exercise 16.4-2.) 462 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis TABLE-I NSERT .T; x/ 1 if T: size == 0 2 allocate T: table with 1 slot 3 T: size D 1 4 if T: num == T: size 5 allocate new-table with 2  T: size slots 6 insert all items in T: table into new-table 7 free T: table 8 T: table D new-table 9 T: size D 2  T: size 10 insert x into T: table 11 T: num D T: num C 1 ring items in line 6. Thus, the actual running time of TABLE-I NSERT is linear in the number of elementary insertions. An expansion occurs when lines 539 execute. Now, we’ll use all three amortized analysis techniques to analyze a sequence of n TABLE-I NSERT operations on an initially empty table. First, we need to deter- mine the actual cost c i of the i th operation. If the current table has room for the new item (or if this is the ûrst operation), then c i D 1, since the only elementary insertion performed is the one in line 10. If the current table is full, however, and an expansion occurs, then c i D i : the cost is 1 for the elementary insertion in line 10 plus i  1 for the items copied from the old table to the new table in line 6. For n operations, the worst-case cost of an operation is O.n/, which leads to an upper bound of O.n 2 / on the total running time for n operations. This bound is not tight, because the table rarely expands in the course of n TABLE-I NSERT operations. Speciûcally, the i th operation causes an expansion only when i  1 is an exact power of 2. The amortized cost of an operation is in fact O.1/, as an aggregate analysis shows. The cost of the i th operation is c i D ( i if i  1 is an exact power of 2 ; 1 otherwise : The total cost of n TABLE-I NSERT operations is therefore n X i D1 c i හ n C blg nc X j D0 2 j < n C 2n (by equation (A.6) on page 1142) D 3n ; 16.4 Dynamic tables 463 (a) (b) $1 $1 (c) $1 $1 $1 $1 (d) $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 (e) $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 $1 (f) Figure 16.3 Analysis of table expansion by the accounting method. Each call of TABLE-I NSERT charges $3 as follows: $1 to pay for the elementary insertion, $1 on the item inserted as prepayment for it to be reinserted later, and $1 on an item that was already in the table, also as prepayment for reinsertion. (a) The table immediately after an expansion, with 8 slots, 4 items (tan slots), and no stored credit. (b)–(e) After each of 4 calls to TABLE-I NSERT, the table has one more item, with $1 stored on the new item and $1 stored on one of the 4 items that were present immediately after the expansion. Slots with these new items are blue. (f) Upon the next call to TABLE-I NSERT, the table is full, and so it expands again. Each item had $1 to pay for it to be reinserted. Now the table looks as it did in part (a), with no stored credit but 16 slots and 8 items. because at most n operations cost 1 each and the costs of the remaining operations form a geometric series. Since the total cost of n TABLE-I NSERT operations is bounded by 3n, the amortized cost of a single operation is at most 3. The accounting method can provide some intuition for why the amortized cost of a TABLE-I NSERT operation should be 3. You can think of each item paying for three elementary insertions: inserting itself into the current table, moving itself the next time that the table expands, and moving some other item that was already in the table the next time that the table expands. For example, suppose that the size of the table is m immediately after an expansion, as shown in Figure 16.3 for m D 8. Then the table holds m=2 items, and it contains no credit. Each call of TABLE- I NSERT charges $3. The elementary insertion that occurs immediately costs $1. Another $1 resides on the item inserted as credit. The third $1 resides as credit on one of the m=2 items already in the table. The table will not ûll again until another m=2  1 items have been inserted, and thus, by the time the table contains m items and is full, each item has $1 on it to pay for it to be reinserted it during the expansion. Now, let’s see how to use the potential method. We’ll use it again in Sec- tion 16.4.2 to design a TABLE-DELETE operation that has an O.1/ amortized cost 464 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis as well. Just as the accounting method had no stored credit immediately after an expansion4that is, when T: num D T: size=24let’s deûne the potential to be 0 when T: num D T: size=2. As elementary insertions occur, the potential needs to increase enough to pay for all the reinsertions that will happen when the table next expands. The table ûlls after another T: size=2 calls of TABLE-I NSERT, when T: num D T: size. The next call of TABLE-I NSERT after these T: size=2 calls trig- gers an expansion with a cost of T: size to reinsert all the items. Therefore, over the course of T: size=2 calls of TABLE-I NSERT, the potential must increase from 0 to T: size. To achieve this increase, let’s design the potential so that each call of TABLE-I NSERT increases it by T: size T: size=2 D 2 ; until the table expands. You can see that the potential function ˆ.T / D 2.T: num  T: size=2/ (16.4) equals 0 immediately after the table expands, when T: num D T: size=2, and it increases by 2 upon each insertion until the table ûlls. Once the table ûlls, that is, when T: num D T: size, the potential ˆ.T / equals T: size. The initial value of the potential is 0, and since the table is always at least half full, T: num  T: size=2, which implies that ˆ.T / is always nonnegative. Thus, the sum of the amortized costs of n TABLE-I NSERT operations gives an upper bound on the sum of the actual costs. To analyze the amortized costs of table operations, it is convenient to think in terms of the change in potential due to each operation. Letting ˆ i denote the potential after the i th operation, we can rewrite equation (16.2) as y c i D c i C ˆ i  ˆ i 1 D c i C �ˆ i ; where �ˆ i is the change in potential due to the i th operation. First, consider the case when the i th insertion does not cause the table to expand. In this case, �ˆ i is 2. Since the actual cost c i is 1, the amortized cost is y c i D c i C �ˆ i D 1 C 2 D 3 : Now, consider the change in potential when the table does expand during the i th insertion because it was full immediately before the insertion. Let num i denote the number of items stored in the table after the i th operation and size i denote the total size of the table after the i th operation, so that size i 1 D num i 1 D i  1 16.4 Dynamic tables 465 0 8 16 24 32 0 8 16 24 32 i size i num i ˆ i Figure 16.4 The effect of a sequence of n TABLE-I NSERT operations on the number num i of items in the table (the brown line), the number size i of slots in the table (the blue line), and the potential ˆ i D 2.num i  size i =2/ (the red line), each being measured after the i th operation. Immediately before an expansion, the potential has built up to the number of items in the table, and therefore it can pay for moving all the items to the new table. Afterward, the potential drops to 0, but it immediately increases by 2 upon insertion of the item that caused the expansion. and therefore ˆ i 1 D 2.size i 1  size i 1 =2/ D size i 1 D i  1. Immediately after the expansion, the potential goes down to 0, and then the new item is inserted, causing the potential to increase to ˆ i D 2. Thus, when the i th insertion triggers an expansion, �ˆ i D 2  .i  1/ D 3  i . When the table expands in the i th TABLE-I NSERT operation, the actual cost c i equals i (to reinsert i  1 items and insert the i th item), giving an amortized cost of y c i D c i C �ˆ i D i C .3  i / D 3 : Figure 16.4 plots the values of num i , size i , and ˆ i against i . Notice how the potential builds to pay for expanding the table. 16.4.2 Table expansion and contraction To implement a TABLE-DELETE operation, it is simple enough to remove the spec- iûed item from the table. In order to limit the amount of wasted space, however, you might want to contract the table when the load factor becomes too small. Ta- 466 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis ble contraction is analogous to table expansion: when the number of items in the table drops too low, allocate a new, smaller table and then copy the items from the old table into the new one. You can then free the storage for the old table by return- ing it to the memory-management system. In order to not waste space, yet keep the amortized costs low, the insertion and deletion procedures should preserve two properties: the load factor of the dynamic table is bounded below by a positive constant, as well as above by 1, and  the amortized cost of a table operation is bounded above by a constant. The actual cost of each operation equals the number of elementary insertions or deletions. You might think that if you double the table size upon inserting an item into a full table, then you should halve the size when deleting an item that would cause the table to become less than half full. This strategy does indeed guarantee that the load factor of the table never drops below 1=2. Unfortunately, it can also cause the amortized cost of an operation to be quite large. Consider the following scenario. Perform n operations on a table T of size n=2, where n is an exact power of 2. The ûrst n=2 operations are insertions, which by our previous analysis cost a total of ‚.n/. At the end of this sequence of insertions, T: num D T: size D n=2. For the second n=2 operations, perform the following sequence: insert, delete, delete, insert, insert, delete, delete, insert, insert, . . . . The ûrst insertion causes the table to expand to size n. The two deletions that follow cause the table to contract back to size n=2. Two further insertions cause another expansion, and so forth. The cost of each expansion and contraction is ‚.n/, and there are ‚.n/ of them. Thus, the total cost of the n operations is ‚.n 2 /, making the amortized cost of an operation ‚.n/. The problem with this strategy is that after the table expands, not enough dele- tions occur to pay for a contraction. Likewise, after the table contracts, not enough insertions take place to pay for an expansion. How can we solve this problem? Allow the load factor of the table to drop below 1=2. Speciûcally, continue to double the table size upon inserting an item into a full table, but halve the table size when deleting an item causes the table to become less than 1=4 full, rather than 1=2 full as before. The load factor of the table is therefore bounded below by the constant 1=4, and the load factor is 1=2 immediately after a contraction. An expansion or contraction should exhaust all the built-up potential, so that immediately after expansion or contraction, when the load factor is 1=2, the table’s potential is 0. Figure 16.5 shows the idea. As the load factor deviates from 1=2, the 16.4 Dynamic tables 467 0 1 1/2 1/4 0 31 per insertion +1 per deletion +2 per insertion –2 per deletion ˛ ˆ �ˆ per operation T: num T: size T: size=2 T: size=4 T: size=2 T: size=4 T: size T: size=4 Figure 16.5 How to think about the potential function ˆ for table insertion and deletion. When the load factor ˛ is 1=2, the potential is 0. In order to accumulate sufûcient potential to pay for reinserting all T: size items when the table ûlls, the potential needs to increase by 2 upon each insertion when ˛  1=2. Correspondingly, the potential decreases by 2 upon each deletion that leaves ˛  1=2. In order to accrue enough potential to cover the cost of reinserting all T: size=4 items when the table contracts, the potential needs to increase by 1 upon each deletion when ˛ < 1=2, and correspondingly the potential decreases by 1 upon each insertion that leaves ˛ < 1=2 . The red area represents load factors less than 1=4, which are not allowed. potential increases so that by the time an expansion or contraction occurs, the table has garnered sufûcient potential to pay for copying all the items into the newly allocated table. Thus, the potential function should grow to T: num by the time that the load factor has either increased to 1 or decreased to 1=4. Immediately after either expanding or contracting the table, the load factor goes back to 1=2 and the table’s potential reduces back to 0. We omit the code for TABLE-DELETE, since it is analogous to TABLE-I NSERT. We assume that if a contraction occurs during TABLE-DELETE, it occurs after the item is deleted from the table. The analysis assumes that whenever the number of items in the table drops to 0, the table occupies no storage. That is, if T: num D 0, then T: size D 0. How do we design a potential function that gives constant amortized time for both insertion and deletion? When the load factor is at least 1=2, the same potential function, ˆ.T / D 2.T: num  T: size=2/, that we used for insertion still works. When the table is at least half full, each insertion increases the potential by 2 if the table does not expand, and each deletion reduces the potential by 2 if it does not cause the load factor to drop below 1=2. What about when the load factor is less than 1=2, that is, when 1=4 හ ˛.T / < 1=2? As before, when ˛.T / D 1=2, so that T: num D T: size=2, the potential ˆ.T / should be 0. To get the load factor from 1=2 down to 1=4, T: size=4 deletions need 468 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis to occur, at which time T: num D T: size=4. To pay for all the reinsertions, the potential must increase from 0 to T: size=4 over these T: size=4 deletions. There- fore, for each call of TABLE-DELETE until the table contracts, the potential should increase by T: size=4 T: size=4 D 1 : Likewise, when ˛ < 1=2, each call of TABLE-I NSERT should decrease the poten- tial by 1. When 1=4 හ ˛.T / < 1=2, the potential function ˆ.T / D T: size=2  T: num produces this desired behavior. Putting the two cases together, we get the potential function ˆ.T / D ( 2.T: num  T: size=2/ if ˛.T /  1=2 ; T: size=2  T: num if ˛.T / < 1=2 : (16.5) The potential of an empty table is 0 and the potential is never negative. Thus, the total amortized cost of a sequence of operations with respect to ˆ provides an upper bound on the actual cost of the sequence. Figure 16.6 illustrates how the potential function behaves over a sequence of insertions and deletions. Now, let’s determine the amortized costs of each operation. As before, let num i denote the number of items stored in the table after the i th operation, size i denote the total size of the table after the i th operation, ˛ i D num i =size i denote the load factor after the i th operation, ˆ i denote the potential after the i th operation, and �ˆ i denote the change in potential due to the i th operation. Initially, num 0 D 0, size 0 D 0, and ˆ 0 D 0. The cases in which the table does not expand or contract and the load factor does not cross ˛ D 1=2 are straightforward. As we have seen, if ˛ i 1  1=2 and the i th operation is an insertion that does not cause the table to expand, then �ˆ i D 2. Likewise, if the i th operation is a deletion and ˛ i  1=2, then �ˆ i D 2. Fur- thermore, if ˛ i 1 < 1=2 and the i th operation is a deletion that does not trigger a contraction, then �ˆ i D 1, and if the i th operation is an insertion and ˛ i < 1=2 , then �ˆ i D 1. In other words, if no expansion or contraction occurs and the load factor does not cross ˛ D 1=2, then  if the load factor stays at or above 1=2, then the potential increases by 2 for an insertion and decreases by 2 for a deletion, and  if the load factor stays below 1=2, then the potential increases by 1 for a deletion and decreases by 1 for an insertion. In each of these cases, the actual cost c i of the i th operation is just 1, and so 16.4 Dynamic tables 469 0 8 16 24 32 0 8 16 24 32 40 48 i size i num i ˆ i Figure 16.6 The effect of a sequence of n TABLE-I NSERT and TABLE-DELETE operations on the number num i of items in the table (the brown line), the number size i of slots in the table (the blue line), and the potential (the red line) i D  2.num i  size i =2/ if ˛ i  1=2 ; size i =2  num i if ˛ i < 1=2 ; where ˛ i D num i =size i , each measured after the i th operation. Immediately before an expansion or contraction, the potential has built up to the number of items in the table, and therefore it can pay for moving all the items to the new table.  if the i th operation is an insertion, its amortized cost y c i is c i C �ˆ i , which is 1 C 2 D 3 if the load factor stays at or above 1=2, and 1 C .1/ D 0 if the load factor stays below 1=2, and  if the i th operation is a deletion, its amortized cost y c i is c i C �ˆ i , which is 1 C .2/ D 1 if the load factor stays at or above 1=2, and 1 C 1 D 2 if the load factor stays below 1=2. Four cases remain: an insertion that takes the load factor from below 1=2 to 1=2, a deletion that takes the load factor from 1=2 to below 1=2, a deletion that causes the table to contract, and an insertion that causes the table to expand. We analyzed that last case at the end of Section 16.4.1 to show that its amortized cost is 3. When the i th operation is a deletion that causes the table to contract, we have num i 1 D size i 1 =4 before the contraction, then the item is deleted, and ûnally num i D size i =2  1 after the contraction. Thus, by equation (16.5) we have 470 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis ˆ i 1 D size i 1 =2  num i 1 D size i 1 =2  size i 1 =4 D size i 1 =4 ; which also equals the actual cost c i of deleting one item and copying size i 1 =4  1 items into the new, smaller table. Since num i D size i =2  1 after the operation has completed, ˛ i < 1=2, and so ˆ i D size i =2  num i D 1 ; giving �ˆ i D 1  size i 1 =4. Therefore, when the i th operation is a deletion that triggers a contraction, its amortized cost is y c i D c i C �ˆ i D size i 1 =4 C .1  size i 1 =4/ D 1 : Finally, we handle the cases where the load factor ûts one case of equation (16.5) before the operation and the other case afterward. We start with deletion, where we have num i 1 D size i 1 =2, so that ˛ i 1 D 1=2, beforehand, and num i D size i =21, so that ˛ i < 1=2 afterward. Because ˛ i 1 D 1=2, we have ˆ i 1 D 0, and because ˛ i < 1=2, we have ˆ i D size i =2  num i D 1. Thus we get that �ˆ i D 1  0 D 1. Since the i th operation is a deletion that does not cause a contraction, the actual cost c i equals 1, and the amortized cost y c i is c i C �ˆ i D 1 C 1 D 2. Conversely, if the i th operation is an insertion that takes the load factor from below 1=2 to equaling 1=2, the change in potential �ˆ i equals 1. Again, the actual cost c i is 1, and now the amortized cost y c i is c i C �ˆ i D 1 C .1/ D 0. In summary, since the amortized cost of each operation is bounded above by a constant, the actual time for any sequence of n operations on a dynamic table is O.n/. Exercises 16.4-1 Using the potential method, analyze the amortized cost of the ûrst table insertion. 16.4-2 You wish to implement a dynamic, open-address hash table. Why might you con- sider the table to be full when its load factor reaches some value ˛ that is strictly less than 1? Describe brieüy how to make insertion into a dynamic, open-address hash table run in such a way that the expected value of the amortized cost per Problems for Chapter 16 471 insertion is O.1/. Why is the expected value of the actual cost per insertion not necessarily O.1/ for all insertions? 16.4-3 Discuss how to use the accounting method to analyze both the insertion and dele- tion operations, assuming that the table doubles in size when its load factor ex- ceeds 1 and the table halves in size when its load factor goes below 1=4. 16.4-4 Suppose that instead of contracting a table by halving its size when its load factor drops below 1=4, you contract the table by multiplying its size by 2=3 when its load factor drops below 1=3. Using the potential function ˆ.T / D j2.T: num  T: size=2/j ; show that the amortized cost of a TABLE-DELETE that uses this strategy is bounded above by a constant. Problems 16-1 Binary reüected Gray code A binary Gray code represents a sequence of nonnegative integers in binary such that to go from one integer to the next, exactly one bit üips every time. The binary reüected Gray code represents a sequence of the integers 0 to 2 k  1 for some positive integer k according to the following recursive method:  For k D 1, the binary reüected Gray code is h0; 1i.  For k  2, ûrst form the binary reüected Gray code for k  1, giving the 2 k1 integers 0 to 2 k1  1. Then form the reüection of this sequence, which is just the sequence in reverse. (That is, the j th integer in the sequence becomes the .2 k1  j  1/st integer in the reüection). Next, add 2 k1 to each of the 2 k1 integers in the reüected sequence. Finally, concatenate the two sequences. For example, for k D 2, ûrst form the binary reüected Gray code h0; 1i for k D 1. Its reüection is the sequence h1; 0i. Adding 2 k1 D 2 to each integer in the reüection gives the sequence h3; 2i. Concatenating the two sequences gives h0; 1; 3; 2i or, in binary, h00; 01; 11; 10i, so that each integer differs from its predecessor by exactly one bit. For k D 3, the reüection of the binary reüected Gray code for k D 2 is h2; 3; 1; 0i and adding 2 k1 D 4 gives h6; 7; 5; 4i. Concatenating produces the sequence h0; 1; 3; 2; 6; 7; 5; 4i, which in binary is h000; 001; 011; 010; 110; 111; 101; 100i. In the binary reüected Gray code, only one bit üips even when wrapping around from the last integer to the ûrst. 472 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis a. Index the integers in a binary reüected Gray code from 0 to 2 k  1, and consider the i th integer in the binary reüected Gray code. To go from the .i  1/st integer to the i th integer in the binary reüected Gray code, exactly one bit üips. Show how to determine which bit üips, given the index i . b. Assuming that given a bit number j , you can üip bit j of an integer in constant time, show how to compute the entire binary reüected Gray code sequence of 2 k numbers in ‚.2 k / time. 16-2 Making binary search dynamic Binary search of a sorted array takes logarithmic search time, but the time to insert a new element is linear in the size of the array. You can improve the time for insertion by keeping several sorted arrays. Speciûcally, suppose that you wish to support SEARCH and I NSERT on a set of n elements. Let k D dlg.n C 1/e, and let the binary representation of n be hn k1 ; n k2 ; : : : ; n 0 i. Maintain k sorted arrays A 0 ; A 1 ; : : : ; A k1 , where for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k  1, the length of array A i is 2 i . Each array is either full or empty, de- pending on whether n i D 1 or n i D 0, respectively. The total number of elements held in all k arrays is therefore P k1 i D0 n i 2 i D n. Although each individual array is sorted, elements in different arrays bear no particular relationship to each other. a. Describe how to perform the SEARCH operation for this data structure. Analyze its worst-case running time. b. Describe how to perform the I NSERT operation. Analyze its worst-case and amortized running times, assuming that the only operations are I NSERT and SEARCH. c. Describe how to implement DELETE. Analyze its worst-case and amortized running times, assuming that there can be D ELETE, I NSERT, and SEARCH op- erations. 16-3 Amortized weight-balanced trees Consider an ordinary binary search tree augmented by adding to each node x the attribute x: size, which gives the number of keys stored in the subtree rooted at x . Let ˛ be a constant in the range 1=2 හ ˛ < 1. We say that a given node x is ˛-balanced if x: left: size හ ˛  x: size and x: right : size හ ˛  x: size. The tree as a whole is ˛-balanced if every node in the tree is ˛-balanced. The follow- ing amortized approach to maintaining weight-balanced trees was suggested by G. Varghese. Problems for Chapter 16 473 a. A 1=2-balanced tree is, in a sense, as balanced as it can be. Given a node x in an arbitrary binary search tree, show how to rebuild the subtree rooted at x so that it becomes 1=2-balanced. Your algorithm should run in ‚.x: size/ time, and it can use O.x: size/ auxiliary storage. b. Show that performing a search in an n-node ˛-balanced binary search tree takes O.lg n/ worst-case time. For the remainder of this problem, assume that the constant ˛ is strictly greater than 1=2. Suppose that you implement I NSERT and DELETE as usual for an n-node binary search tree, except that after every such operation, if any node in the tree is no longer ˛-balanced, then you <rebuild= the subtree rooted at the highest such node in the tree so that it becomes 1=2-balanced. We’ll analyze this rebuilding scheme using the potential method. For a node x in a binary search tree T , deûne �.x/ D jx: left: size  x: right : sizej : Deûne the potential of T as ˆ.T / D c X x2T Wĩ.x/2 �.x/ ; where c is a sufûciently large constant that depends on ˛. c. Argue that any binary search tree has nonnegative potential and also that a 1=2-balanced tree has potential 0. d. Suppose that m units of potential can pay for rebuilding an m-node subtree. How large must c be in terms of ˛ in order for it to take O.1/ amortized time to rebuild a subtree that is not ˛-balanced? e. Show that inserting a node into or deleting a node from an n-node ˛-balanced tree costs O.lg n/ amortized time. 16-4 The cost of restructuring red-black trees There are four basic operations on red-black trees that perform structural modi- ûcations: node insertions, node deletions, rotations, and color changes. We have seen that RB-I NSERT and RB-DELETE use only O.1/ rotations, node insertions, and node deletions to maintain the red-black properties, but they may make many more color changes. a. Describe a legal red-black tree with n nodes such that calling RB-I NSERT to add the .n C 1/st node causes �.lg n/ color changes. Then describe a legal 474 Chapter 16 Amortized Analysis red-black tree with n nodes for which calling RB-DELETE on a particular node causes �.lg n/ color changes. Although the worst-case number of color changes per operation can be logarithmic, you will prove that any sequence of m RB-I NSERT and RB-DELETE operations on an initially empty red-black tree causes O.m/ structural modiûcations in the worst case. b. Some of the cases handled by the main loop of the code of both RB-I NSERT- FIXUP and RB-DELETE-FIXUP are terminating: once encountered, they cause the loop to terminate after a constant number of additional operations. For each of the cases of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP and RB-DELETE-F IXUP, specify which are terminating and which are not. (Hint: Look at Figures 13.5, 13.6, and 13.7 in Sections 13.3 and 13.4.) You will ûrst analyze the structural modiûcations when only insertions are per- formed. Let T be a red-black tree, and deûne ˆ.T / to be the number of red nodes in T . Assume that one unit of potential can pay for the structural modiûcations performed by any of the three cases of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. c. Let T 0 be the result of applying Case 1 of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP to T . Argue that ˆ.T 0 / D ˆ.T /  1. d. We can break the operation of the RB-I NSERT procedure into three parts. List the structural modiûcations and potential changes resulting from lines 1316 of RB-I NSERT, from nonterminating cases of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP, and from terminating cases of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP. e. Using part (d), argue that the amortized number of structural modiûcations per- formed by any call of RB-I NSERT is O.1/. Next you will prove that there are O.m/ structural modiûcations when both inser- tions and deletions occur. Deûne, for each node x , w.x/ D „ 0 if x is red ; 1 if x is black and has no red children ; 0 if x is black and has one red child ; 2 if x is black and has two red children : Now redeûne the potential of a red-black tree T as ˆ.T / D X x2T w.x/ ; Notes for Chapter 16 475 and let T 0 be the tree that results from applying any nonterminating case of RB- I NSERT-FIXUP or RB-DELETE-FIXUP to T . f. Show that ˆ.T 0 / හ ˆ.T /  1 for all nonterminating cases of RB-I NSERT- FIXUP. Argue that the amortized number of structural modiûcations performed by any call of RB-I NSERT-FIXUP is O.1/. g. Show that ˆ.T 0 / හ ˆ.T /  1 for all nonterminating cases of RB-DELETE- FIXUP. Argue that the amortized number of structural modiûcations performed by any call of RB-DELETE-FIXUP is O.1/. h. Complete the proof that in the worst case, any sequence of m RB-I NSERT and RB-DELETE operations performs O.m/ structural modiûcations. Chapter notes Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] used aggregate analysis to determine the running time of operations on a disjoint-set forest. We’ll analyze this data structure using the potential method in Chapter 19. Tarjan [430] surveys the accounting and poten- tial methods of amortized analysis and presents several applications. He attributes the accounting method to several authors, including M. R. Brown, R. E. Tarjan, S. Huddleston, and K. Mehlhorn. He attributes the potential method to D. D. Sleator. The term <amortized= is due to D. D. Sleator and R. E. Tarjan. Potential functions are also useful for proving lower bounds for certain types of problems. For each conûguration of the problem, deûne a potential function that maps the conûguration to a real number. Then determine the potential ˆ init of the initial conûguration, the potential ˆ ûnal of the ûnal conûguration, and the maximum change in potential �ˆ max due to any step. The number of steps must therefore be at least jˆ ûnal  ˆ init j = j�ˆ max j. Examples of potential functions to prove lower bounds in I/O complexity appear in works by Cormen, Sundquist, and Wisniewski [105], Floyd [146], and Aggarwal and Vitter [3]. Krumme, Cybenko, and Venkataraman [271] applied potential functions to prove lower bounds on gos- siping: communicating a unique item from each vertex in a graph to every other vertex. Part V Advanced Data Structures Introduction This part returns to studying data structures that support operations on dynamic sets, but at a more advanced level than Part III. One of the chapters, for example, makes extensive use of the amortized analysis techniques from Chapter 16. Chapter 17 shows how to augment red-black trees4adding additional informa- tion in each node4to support dynamic-set operations in addition to those covered in Chapters 12 and 13. The ûrst example augments red-black trees to dynamically maintain order statistics for a set of keys. Another example augments them in a different way to maintain intervals of real numbers. Chapter 17 includes a theo- rem giving sufûcient conditions for when a red-black tree can be augmented while maintaining the O.lg n/ running times for insertion and deletion. Chapter 18 presents B-trees, which are balanced search trees speciûcally de- signed to be stored on disks. Since disks operate much more slowly than random- access memory, B-tree performance depends not only on how much computing time the dynamic-set operations consume but also on how many disk accesses they perform. For each B-tree operation, the number of disk accesses increases with the height of the B-tree, but B-tree operations keep the height low. Chapter 19 examines data structures for disjoint sets. Starting with a universe of n elements, each initially in its own singleton set, the operation UNION unites two sets. At all times, the n elements are partitioned into disjoint sets, even as calls to the UNION operation change the members of a set dynamically. The query FIND-SET identiûes the unique set that contains a given element at the moment. Representing each set as a simple rooted tree yields surprisingly fast operations: a sequence of m operations runs in O.m ˛.n// time, where ˛.n/ is an incredibly slowly growing function4˛.n/ is at most 4 in any conceivable application. The amortized analysis that proves this time bound is as complex as the data structure is simple. 478 Part V Advanced Data Structures The topics covered in this part are by no means the only examples of <advanced= data structures. Other advanced data structures include the following:  Fibonacci heaps [156] implement mergeable heaps (see Problem 10-2 on page 268) with the operations I NSERT, MINIMUM, and UNION taking only O.1/ actual and amortized time, and the operations E XTRACT-MIN and DELETE taking O.lg n/ amortized time. The most signiûcant advantage of these data structures, however, is that DECREASE-KEY takes only O.1/ amor- tized time. Strict Fibonacci heaps [73], developed later, made all of these time bounds actual. Because the DECREASE-KEY operation takes constant amor- tized time, (strict) Fibonacci heaps constitute key components of some of the asymptotically fastest algorithms to date for graph problems.  Dynamic trees [415, 429] maintain a forest of disjoint rooted trees. Each edge in each tree has a real-valued cost. Dynamic trees support queries to ûnd par- ents, roots, edge costs, and the minimum edge cost on a simple path from a node up to a root. Trees may be manipulated by cutting edges, updating all edge costs on a simple path from a node up to a root, linking a root into another tree, and making a node the root of the tree it appears in. One implementation of dynamic trees gives an O.lg n/ amortized time bound for each operation, while a more complicated implementation yields O.lg n/ worst-case time bounds. Dynamic trees are used in some of the asymptotically fastest network-üow algorithms.  Splay trees [418, 429] are a form of binary search tree on which the standard search-tree operations run in O.lg n/ amortized time. One application of splay trees simpliûes dynamic trees.  Persistent data structures allow queries, and sometimes updates as well, on past versions of a data structure. For example, linked data structures can be made persistent with only a small time and space cost [126]. Problem 13-1 gives a simple example of a persistent dynamic set.  Several data structures allow a faster implementation of dictionary operations (I NSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) for a restricted universe of keys. By tak- ing advantage of these restrictions, they are able to achieve better worst-case asymptotic running times than comparison-based data structures. If the keys are unique integers drawn from the set f0; 1; 2; : : : ; u  1g, where u is an ex- act power of 2, then a recursive data structure known as a van Emde Boas tree [440, 441] supports each of the operations S EARCH, I NSERT, DELETE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR in O.lg lg u/ time. Fusion trees [157] were the ûrst data structure to allow faster dictionary opera- tions when the universe is restricted to integers, implementing these operations in O.lg n= lg lg n/ time. Several subsequent data structures, including expo- nential search trees [17], have also given improved bounds on some or all of Part V Advanced Data Structures 479 the dictionary operations and are mentioned in the chapter notes throughout this book.  Dynamic graph data structures support various queries while allowing the structure of a graph to change through operations that insert or delete vertices or edges. Examples of the queries that they support include vertex connectivity [214], edge connectivity, minimum spanning trees [213], biconnectivity, and transitive closure [212]. Chapter notes throughout this book mention additional data structures. 17 Augmenting Data Structures Some solutions require no more than a <textbook= data structure4such as a doubly linked list, a hash table, or a binary search tree4but many others require a dash of creativity. Rarely will you need to create an entirely new type of data structure, though. More often, you can augment a textbook data structure by storing addi- tional information in it. You can then program new operations for the data structure to support your application. Augmenting a data structure is not always straightfor- ward, however, since the added information must be updated and maintained by the ordinary operations on the data structure. This chapter discusses two data structures based on red-black trees that are aug- mented with additional information. Section 17.1 describes a data structure that supports general order-statistic operations on a dynamic set: quickly ûnding the i th smallest number or the rank of a given element. Section 17.2 abstracts the pro- cess of augmenting a data structure and provides a theorem that you can use when augmenting red-black trees. Section 17.3 uses this theorem to help design a data structure for maintaining a dynamic set of intervals, such as time intervals. You can use this data structure to quickly ûnd an interval that overlaps a given query interval. 17.1 Dynamic order statistics Chapter 9 introduced the notion of an order statistic. Speciûcally, the i th order statistic of a set of n elements, where i 2 f1; 2; : : : ; ng, is simply the element in the set with the i th smallest key. In Chapter 9, you saw how to determine any order statistic in O.n/ time from an unordered set. This section shows how to modify red-black trees so that you can determine any order statistic for a dynamic set in O.lg n/ time and also compute the rank of an element4its position in the linear order of the set4in O.lg n/ time. 17.1 Dynamic order statistics 481 1 3 7 12 10 14 16 14 2 1 1 2 4 7 20 19 21 21 17 28 35 39 38 47 30 41 26 1 2 1 4 12 1 1 1 3 5 1 7 20 key size Figure 17.1 An order-statistic tree, which is an augmented red-black tree. In addition to its usual attributes, each node x has an attribute x: size, which is the number of nodes, other than the sentinel, in the subtree rooted at x. Figure 17.1 shows a data structure that can support fast order-statistic operations. An order-statistic tree T is simply a red-black tree with additional information stored in each node. Each node x contains the usual red-black tree attributes x: key, x: color, x: p, x: left, and x: right , along with a new attribute, x: size. This attribute contains the number of internal nodes in the subtree rooted at x (including x itself, but not including any sentinels), that is, the size of the subtree. If we deûne the sentinel’s size to be 04that is, we set T: nil: size to be 04then we have the identity x: size D x: left: size C x: right: size C 1 : Keys need not be distinct in an order-statistic tree. For example, the tree in Fig- ure 17.1 has two keys with value 14 and two keys with value 21. When equal keys are present, the above notion of rank is not well deûned. We remove this ambiguity for an order-statistic tree by deûning the rank of an element as the position at which it would be printed in an inorder walk of the tree. In Figure 17.1, for example, the key 14 stored in a black node has rank 5, and the key 14 stored in a red node has rank 6. Retrieving the element with a given rank Before we show how to maintain the size information during insertion and dele- tion, let’s see how to implement two order-statistic queries that use this additional information. We begin with an operation that retrieves the element with a given rank. The procedure OS-SELECT .x; i / on the following page returns a pointer to the node containing the i th smallest key in the subtree rooted at x . To ûnd the node with the i th smallest key in an order-statistic tree T , call OS-SELECT .T: root ; i /. Here is how OS-SELECT works. Line 1 computes r , the rank of node x within the subtree rooted at x . The value of x: left: size is the number of nodes that come 482 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures OS-SELECT .x; i / 1 r D x: left: size C 1 // rank of x within the subtree rooted at x 2 if i == r 3 return x 4 elseif i < r 5 return OS-SELECT .x: left; i / 6 else return OS-SELECT .x: right; i  r/ before x in an inorder tree walk of the subtree rooted at x . Thus, x: left: size C 1 is the rank of x within the subtree rooted at x . If i D r , then node x is the i th smallest element, and so line 3 returns x . If i < r , then the i th smallest element resides in x ’s left subtree, and therefore, line 5 recurses on x: left. If i > r , then the i th smallest element resides in x ’s right subtree. Since the subtree rooted at x contains r elements that come before x ’s right subtree in an inorder tree walk, the i th smallest element in the subtree rooted at x is the .i  r/th smallest element in the subtree rooted at x: right. Line 6 determines this element recursively. As an example of how OS-SELECT operates, consider a search for the 17th smallest element in the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1. The search starts with x as the root, whose key is 26, and with i D 17. Since the size of 26’s left subtree is 12, its rank is 13. Thus, the node with rank 17 is the 17  13 D 4th smallest element in 26’s right subtree. In the recursive call, x is the node with key 41, and i D 4. Since the size of 41’s left subtree is 5, its rank within its subtree is 6. Therefore, the node with rank 4 is the 4th smallest element in 41’s left subtree. In the recursive call, x is the node with key 30, and its rank within its subtree is 2. The procedure recurses once again to ûnd the 4  2 D 2nd smallest element in the subtree rooted at the node with key 38. Its left subtree has size 1, which means it is the second smallest element. Thus, the procedure returns a pointer to the node with key 38. Because each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic tree, the total time for OS-SELECT is at worst proportional to the height of the tree. Since the tree is a red-black tree, its height is O.lg n/, where n is the number of nodes. Thus, the running time of OS-SELECT is O.lg n/ for a dynamic set of n elements. Determining the rank of an element Given a pointer to a node x in an order-statistic tree T , the procedure OS-RANK on the facing page returns the position of x in the linear order determined by an inorder tree walk of T . 17.1 Dynamic order statistics 483 OS-RANK.T; x/ 1 r D x: left: size C 1 // rank of x within the subtree rooted at x 2 y D x // root of subtree being examined 3 while y ¤ T: root 4 if y == y: p: right // if root of a right subtree . . . 5 r D r C y: p: left: size C 1 // . . . add in parent and its left subtree 6 y D y: p // move y toward the root 7 return r The OS-RANK procedure works as follows. You can think of node x ’s rank as the number of nodes preceding x in an inorder tree walk, plus 1 for x itself. OS-RANK maintains the following loop invariant: At the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 336, r is the rank of x: key in the subtree rooted at node y . We use this loop invariant to show that OS-RANK works correctly as follows: Initialization: Prior to the ûrst iteration, line 1 sets r to be the rank of x: key within the subtree rooted at x . Setting y D x in line 2 makes the invariant true the ûrst time the test in line 3 executes. Maintenance: At the end of each iteration of the while loop, line 6 sets y D y: p. Thus, we must show that if r is the rank of x: key in the subtree rooted at y at the start of the loop body, then r is the rank of x: key in the subtree rooted at y: p at the end of the loop body. In each iteration of the while loop, consider the subtree rooted at y: p. The value of r already includes the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node y that precede x in an inorder walk, and so the procedure must add the nodes in the subtree rooted at y ’s sibling that precede x in an inorder walk, plus 1 for y: p if it, too, precedes x . If y is a left child, then neither y: p nor any node in y: p’s right subtree precedes x , and so OS-RANK leaves r alone. Otherwise, y is a right child and all the nodes in y: p’s left subtree precede x , as does y: p itself. In this case, line 5 adds y: p: left: size C 1 to the current value of r . Termination: Because each iteration of the loop moves y toward the root and the loop terminates when y D T: root , the loop eventually terminates. Moreover, the subtree rooted at y is the entire tree. Thus, the value of r is the rank of x: key in the entire tree. As an example, when OS-RANK runs on the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1 to ûnd the rank of the node with key 38, the following sequence of values of y: key and r occurs at the top of the while loop: 484 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures iteration y: key r 1 38 2 2 30 4 3 41 4 4 26 17 The procedure returns the rank 17. Since each iteration of the while loop takes O.1/ time, and y goes up one level in the tree with each iteration, the running time of OS-RANK is at worst proportional to the height of the tree: O.lg n/ on an n-node order-statistic tree. Maintaining subtree sizes Given the size attribute in each node, OS-SELECT and OS-RANK can quickly compute order-statistic information. But if the basic modifying operations on red- black trees cannot efûciently maintain the size attribute, our work will have been for naught. Let’s see how to maintain subtree sizes for both insertion and deletion without affecting the asymptotic running time of either operation. Recall from Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists of two phases. The ûrst phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node as a child of an existing node. The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors and performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties. To maintain the subtree sizes in the ûrst phase, simply increment x: size for each node x on the simple path traversed from the root down toward the leaves. The new node added gets a size of 1. Since there are O.lg n/ nodes on the traversed path, the additional cost of maintaining the size attributes is O.lg n/. In the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree are caused by rotations, of which there are at most two. Moreover, a rotation is a local operation: only two nodes have their size attributes invalidated. The link around which the rotation is performed is incident on these two nodes. Referring to the code for LEFT-ROTATE .T; x/ on page 336, add the following lines: 13 y: size D x: size 14 x: size D x: left: size C x: right : size C 1 Figure 17.2 illustrates how the attributes are updated. The change to RIGHT- ROTATE is symmetric. Since inserting into a red-black tree requires at most two rotations, updating the size attributes in the second phase costs only O.1/ additional time. Thus, the total time for insertion into an n-node order-statistic tree is O.lg n/, which is asymptot- ically the same as for an ordinary red-black tree. 17.1 Dynamic order statistics 485 LEFT-ROTATE(T, x) RIGHT-ROTATE(T, y) 93 19 y 42 11 x 6 4 7 93 42 19 12 6 4 7 x y Figure 17.2 Updating subtree sizes during rotations. The updates are local, requiring only the size information stored in x, y, and the roots of the subtrees shown as triangles. Deletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the ûrst operates on the underlying search tree, and the second causes at most three rotations and otherwise performs no structural changes. (See Section 13.4.) The ûrst phase removes one node ´ from the tree and could move at most two other nodes within the tree (nodes y and x in Figure 12.4 on page 323). To update the subtree sizes, simply traverse a simple path from the lowest node that moves (starting from its original position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the size attribute of each node on the path. Since this path has length O.lg n/ in an n-node red- black tree, the additional time spent maintaining size attributes in the ûrst phase is O.lg n/. For the O.1/ rotations in the second phase of deletion, handle them in the same manner as for insertion. Thus, both insertion and deletion, including maintaining the size attributes, take O.lg n/ time for an n-node order-statistic tree. Exercises 17.1-1 Show how OS-SELECT .T: root ; 10/ operates on the red-black tree T shown in Figure 17.1. 17.1-2 Show how OS-RANK.T; x/ operates on the red-black tree T shown in Figure 17.1 and the node x with x: key D 35. 17.1-3 Write a nonrecursive version of OS-SELECT. 17.1-4 Write a procedure OS-KEY-RANK.T; k/ that takes an order-statistic tree T and a key k and returns the rank of k in the dynamic set represented by T . Assume that the keys of T are distinct. 486 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures 17.1-5 Given an element x in an n-node order-statistic tree and a natural number i , show how to determine the i th successor of x in the linear order of the tree in O.lg n/ time. 17.1-6 The procedures OS-SELECT and OS-RANK use the size attribute of a node only to compute a rank. Suppose that you store in each node its rank in the subtree of which it is the root instead of the size attribute. Show how to maintain this information during insertion and deletion. (Remember that these two operations can cause rotations.) 17.1-7 Show how to use an order-statistic tree to count the number of inversions (see Problem 2-4 on page 47) in an array of n distinct elements in O.n lg n/ time. ? 17.1-8 Consider n chords on a circle, each deûned by its endpoints. Describe an O.n lg n/- time algorithm to determine the number of pairs of chords that intersect inside the circle. (For example, if the n chords are all diameters that meet at the center, then the answer is ã n 2 ä .) Assume that no two chords share an endpoint. 17.2 How to augment a data structure The process of augmenting a basic data structure to support additional functionality occurs quite frequently in algorithm design. We’ll use it again in the next section to design a data structure that supports operations on intervals. This section examines the steps involved in such augmentation. It includes a useful theorem that allows you to augment red-black trees easily in many cases. You can break the process of augmenting a data structure into four steps: 1. Choose an underlying data structure. 2. Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying data structure. 3. Verify that you can maintain the additional information for the basic modifying operations on the underlying data structure. 4. Develop new operations. As with any prescriptive design method, you’ll rarely be able to follow the steps precisely in the order given. Most design work contains an element of trial and error, and progress on all steps usually proceeds in parallel. There is no point, 17.2 How to augment a data structure 487 for example, in determining additional information and developing new operations (steps 2 and 4) if you cannot maintain the additional information efûciently. Never- theless, this four-step method provides a good focus for your efforts in augmenting a data structure, and it is also a good framework for documenting an augmented data structure. We followed these four steps in Section 17.1 to design order-statistic trees. For step 1, we chose red-black trees as the underlying data structure. Red-black trees seemed like a good starting point because they efûciently support other dynamic- set operations on a total order, such as M INIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR. In Step 2, we added the size attribute, so that each node x stores the size of the subtree rooted at x . Generally, the additional information makes operations more efûcient. For example, it is possible to implement OS-S ELECT and OS-RANK using just the keys stored in the tree, but then they would not run in O.lg n/ time. Sometimes, the additional information is pointer information rather than data, as in Exercise 17.2-1. For step 3, we ensured that insertion and deletion can maintain the size attributes while still running in O.lg n/ time. Ideally, you would like to update only a few elements of the data structure in order to maintain the additional information. For example, if each node simply stores its rank in the tree, the OS-S ELECT and OS-RANK procedures run quickly, but inserting a new minimum element might cause a change to this information in every node of the tree. Because we chose to store subtree sizes instead, inserting a new element causes information to change in only O.lg n/ nodes. In Step 4, we developed the operations OS-SELECT and OS-RANK. After all, the need for new operations is why anyone bothers to augment a data structure in the ûrst place. Occasionally, rather than developing new operations, you can use the additional information to expedite existing ones, as in Exercise 17.2-1. Augmenting red-black trees When red-black trees underlie an augmented data structure, we can prove that in- sertion and deletion can always efûciently maintain certain kinds of additional in- formation, thereby simplifying step 3. The proof of the following theorem is sim- ilar to the argument from Section 17.1 that we can maintain the size attribute for order-statistic trees. Theorem 17.1 (Augmenting a red-black tree) Let f be an attribute that augments a red-black tree T of n nodes, and suppose that the value of f for each node x depends only the information in nodes x , x: left, and x: right (possibly including x: left: f and x: right : f ), and that the value of x: f can 488 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures be computed from this information in O.1/ time. Then, the insertion and deletion operations can maintain the values of f in all nodes of T without asymptotically affecting the O.lg n/ running times of these operations. Proof The main idea of the proof is that a change to an f attribute in a node x propagates only to ancestors of x in the tree. That is, changing x: f may require x: p: f to be updated, but nothing else; updating x: p: f may require x: p: p: f to be updated, but nothing else; and so on up the tree. After updating T: root : f , no other node depends on the new value, and so the process terminates. Since the height of a red-black tree is O.lg n/, changing an f attribute in a node costs O.lg n/ time in updating all nodes that depend on the change. As we saw in Section 13.3, insertion of a node x into red-black tree T consists of two phases. If the tree T is empty, then the ûrst phase simply makes x be the root of T . If T is not empty, then the ûrst phase inserts x as a child of an existing node. Because we assume that the value of x: f depends only on information in the other attributes of x itself and the information in x ’s children, and because x ’s children are both the sentinel T: nil, it takes only O.1/ time to compute the value of x: f . Having computed x: f , the change propagates up the tree. Thus, the total time for the ûrst phase of insertion is O.lg n/. During the second phase, the only structural changes to the tree come from rotations. Since only two nodes change in a rotation, but a change to an attribute might need to propagate up to the root, the total time for updating the f attributes is O.lg n/ per rotation. Since the number of rotations during insertion is at most two, the total time for insertion is O.lg n/. Like insertion, deletion has two phases, as Section 13.4 discusses. In the ûrst phase, changes to the tree occur when a node is deleted, and at most two other nodes could move within the tree. Propagating the updates to f caused by these changes costs at most O.lg n/, since the changes modify the tree locally along a simple path from the lowest changed node to the root. Fixing up the red-black tree during the second phase requires at most three rotations, and each rotation requires at most O.lg n/ time to propagate the updates to f . Thus, like insertion, the total time for deletion is O.lg n/. In many cases, such as maintaining the size attributes in order-statistic trees, the cost of updating after a rotation is O.1/, rather than the O.lg n/ derived in the proof of Theorem 17.1. Exercise 17.2-3 gives an example. On the other hand, when an update after a rotation requires a traversal all the way up to the root, it is important that insertion into and deletion from a red-black tree require a constant number of rotations. The chapter notes for Chapter 13 list other schemes for balancing search trees that do not bound the number of rotations per insertion or deletion by a constant. If each operation might require ‚.lg n/ rota- 17.3 Interval trees 489 tions and each rotation traverses a path up to the root, then a single operation could require ‚.lg 2 n/ time, rather than the O.lg n/ time bound given by Theorem 17.1. Exercises 17.2-1 Show, by adding pointers to the nodes, how to support each of the dynamic-set queries MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR in O.1/ worst- case time on an augmented order-statistic tree. The asymptotic performance of other operations on order-statistic trees should not be affected. 17.2-2 Can you maintain the black-heights of nodes in a red-black tree as attributes in the nodes of the tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of any of the red- black tree operations? Show how, or argue why not. How about maintaining the depths of nodes? 17.2-3 Let ˝ be an associative binary operator, and let a be an attribute maintained in each node of a red-black tree. Suppose that you want to include in each node x an addi- tional attribute f such that x: f D x 1 : a ˝ x 2 : a ˝    ˝ x m : a, where x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x m is the inorder listing of nodes in the subtree rooted at x . Show how to update the f attributes in O.1/ time after a rotation. Modify your argument slightly to apply it to the size attributes in order-statistic trees. 17.3 Interval trees This section shows how to augment red-black trees to support operations on dy- namic sets of intervals. In this section, we’ll assume that intervals are closed. Ex- tending the results to open and half-open intervals is conceptually straightforward. (See page 1157 for deûnitions of closed, open, and half-open intervals.) Intervals are convenient for representing events that each occupy a continuous period of time. For example, you could query a database of time intervals to ûnd out which events occurred during a given interval. The data structure in this section provides an efûcient means for maintaining such an interval database. A simple way to represent an interval Œt 1 ; t 2 � is as an object i with attributes i: low D t 1 (the low endpoint) and i: high D t 2 (the high endpoint). We say that in- tervals i and i 0 overlap if i \\ i 0 ¤ ;, that is, if i: low හ i 0 : high and i 0 : low හ i: high. 490 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures i i i i (a) i (b) i (c) iʹ iʹ iʹ iʹ iʹ iʹ Figure 17.3 The interval trichotomy for two closed intervals i and i 0 . (a) If i and i 0 overlap, there are four situations, and in each, i: low හ i 0 : high and i 0 : low හ i: high. (b) The intervals do not overlap, and i: high < i 0 : low. (c) The intervals do not overlap, and i 0 : high < i: low. As Figure 17.3 shows, any two intervals i and i 0 satisfy the interval trichotomy, that is, exactly one of the following three properties holds: a. i and i 0 overlap, b. i is to the left of i 0 (i.e., i: high < i 0 : low), c. i is to the right of i 0 (i.e., i 0 : high < i: low). An interval tree is a red-black tree that maintains a dynamic set of elements, with each element x containing an interval x: int. Interval trees support the following operations: I NTERVAL-I NSERT .T; x/ adds the element x , whose int attribute is assumed to contain an interval, to the interval tree T . I NTERVAL-DELETE .T; x/ removes the element x from the interval tree T . I NTERVAL-SEARCH .T; i / returns a pointer to an element x in the interval tree T such that x: int overlaps interval i , or a pointer to the sentinel T: nil if no such element belongs to the set. Figure 17.4 shows how an interval tree represents a set of intervals. The four- step method from Section 17.2 will guide our design of an interval tree and the operations that run on it. Step 1: Underlying data structure A red-black tree serves as the underlying data structure. Each node x contains an interval x: int. The key of x is the low endpoint, x: int: low, of the interval. Thus, an inorder tree walk of the data structure lists the intervals in sorted order by low endpoint. 17.3 Interval trees 491 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 5 6 8 15 16 17 19 25 26 26 30 20 19 21 23 9 10 8 3 (a) [0,3] 3 [6,10] 10 [5,8] 10 [8,9] 23 [15,23] 23 [16,21] 30 [17,19] 20 [26,26] 26 [19,20] 20 (b) [25,30] 30 int max Figure 17.4 An interval tree. (a) A set of 10 intervals, shown sorted bottom to top by left endpoint. (b) The interval tree that represents them. Each node x contains an interval, shown above the dashed line, and the maximum value of any interval endpoint in the subtree rooted at x, shown below the dashed line. An inorder tree walk of the tree lists the nodes in sorted order by left endpoint. Step 2: Additional information In addition to the intervals themselves, each node x contains a value x: max, which is the maximum value of any interval endpoint stored in the subtree rooted at x . Step 3: Maintaining the information We must verify that insertion and deletion take O.lg n/ time on an interval tree of n nodes. It is simple enough to determine x: max in O.1/ time, given interval x: int and the max values of node x ’s children: x: max D max fx: int: high; x: left : max; x: right : maxg : 492 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures Thus, by Theorem 17.1, insertion and deletion run in O.lg n/ time. In fact, you can use either Exercise 17.2-3 or 17.3-1 to show how to update all the max attributes that change after a rotation in just O.1/ time. Step 4: Developing new operations The only new operation is I NTERVAL-SEARCH .T; i /, which ûnds a node in tree T whose interval overlaps interval i . If there is no interval in the tree that overlaps i , the procedure returns a pointer to the sentinel T: nil. I NTERVAL-SEARCH .T; i / 1 x D T: root 2 while x ¤ T: nil and i does not overlap x: int 3 if x: left ¤ T: nil and x: left: max  i: low 4 x D x: left // overlap in left subtree or no overlap in right subtree 5 else x D x: right // no overlap in left subtree 6 return x The search for an interval that overlaps i starts at the root of the tree and proceeds downward. It terminates when either it ûnds an overlapping interval or it reaches the sentinel T: nil. Since each iteration of the basic loop takes O.1/ time, and since the height of an n-node red-black tree is O.lg n/, the I NTERVAL-SEARCH procedure takes O.lg n/ time. Before we see why I NTERVAL-SEARCH is correct, let’s examine how it works on the interval tree in Figure 17.4. Let’s look for an interval that overlaps the interval i D Œ22; 25�. Begin with x as the root, which contains Œ16; 21� and does not overlap i . Since x: left: max D 23 is greater than i: low D 22, the loop continues with x as the left child of the root4the node containing Œ8; 9�, which also does not overlap i . This time, x: left: max D 10 is less than i: low D 22, and so the loop continues with the right child of x as the new x . Because the interval Œ15; 23� stored in this node overlaps i , the procedure returns this node. Now let’s try an unsuccessful search, for an interval that overlaps i D Œ11; 14� in the interval tree of Figure 17.4. Again, begin with x as the root. Since the root’s interval Œ16; 21� does not overlap i , and since x: left: max D 23 is greater than i: low D 11, go left to the node containing Œ8; 9�. Interval Œ8; 9� does not over- lap i , and x: left: max D 10 is less than i: low D 11, and so the search goes right. (No interval in the left subtree overlaps i .) Interval Œ15; 23� does not overlap i , and its left child is T: nil, so again the search goes right, the loop terminates, and I NTERVAL-SEARCH returns the sentinel T: nil. 17.3 Interval trees 493 To see why I NTERVAL-SEARCH is correct, we must understand why it sufûces to examine a single path from the root. The basic idea is that at any node x , if x: int does not overlap i , the search always proceeds in a safe direction: the search will deûnitely ûnd an overlapping interval if the tree contains one. The following theorem states this property more precisely. Theorem 17.2 Any execution of I NTERVAL-SEARCH .T; i / either returns a node whose interval overlaps i , or it returns T: nil and the tree T contains no node whose interval over- laps i . Proof The while loop of lines 235 terminates when either x D T: nil or i overlaps x: int. In the latter case, it is certainly correct to return x . Therefore, we focus on the former case, in which the while loop terminates because x D T: nil, which is the node that I NTERVAL-SEARCH returns. We’ll prove that if the procedure returns T: nil, then it did not miss any intervals in T that overlap i . The idea is to show that whether the search goes left in line 4 or right in line 5, it always heads toward a node containing an interval overlapping i , if any such interval exists. In particular, we’ll prove that 1. If the search goes left in line 4, then the left subtree of node x contains an inter- val that overlaps i or the right subtree of x contains no interval that overlaps i . Therefore, even if x ’s left subtree contains no interval that overlaps i but the search goes left, it does not make a mistake, because x ’s right subtree does not contain an interval overlapping i , either. 2. If the search goes right in line 5, then the left subtree of x contains no interval that overlaps i . Thus, if the search goes right, it does not make a mistake. For both cases, we rely on the interval trichotomy. Let’s start with the case where the search goes right, whose proof is simpler. By the tests in line 3, we know that x: left D T: nil or x: left: max < i: low. If x: left D T: nil, then x ’s left subtree contains no interval that overlaps i , since it contains no intervals at all. Now suppose that x: left ¤ T: nil, so that we must have x: left: max < i: low. Consider any interval i 0 in x ’s left subtree. Because x: left : max is the maximum endpoint in x ’s left subtree, we have i 0 : high හ x: left: max. Thus, as Figure 17.5(a) shows, i 0 : high හ x: left: max < i: low : By the interval trichotomy, therefore, intervals i and i 0 do not overlap, and so x ’s left subtree contains no interval that overlaps i . Now we examine the case in which the search goes left. If the left subtree of node x contains an interval that overlaps i , we’re done, so let’s assume that no node 494 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures i (a) (b) iʹ iʹ i iʹ iʹʹ iʹʹ iʹʹ Figure 17.5 Intervals in the proof of Theorem 17.2. The value of x: left: max is shown in each case as a dashed line. (a) The search goes right. No interval i 0 in x’s left subtree can overlap i . (b) The search goes left. The left subtree of x contains an interval that overlaps i (situation not shown), or x’s left subtree contains an interval i 0 such that i 0 : high D x: left: max. Since i does not overlap i 0 , neither does it overlap any interval i 00 in x’s right subtree, since i 0 : low හ i 00 : low. in x ’s left subtree overlaps i . We need to show that in this case, no node in x ’s right subtree overlaps i , so that going left will not miss any overlaps in x ’s right subtree. By the tests in line 3, the left subtree of x is not empty and x: left: max  i: low. By the deûnition of the max attribute, x ’s left subtree contains some interval i 0 such that 0 : high D x: left: max  i: low ; as illustrated in Figure 17.5(b). Since i 0 is in x ’s left subtree, it does not overlap i , and since i 0 : high  i: low, the interval trichotomy tells us that i: high < i 0 : low. Now we bring in the property that interval trees are keyed on the low endpoints of intervals. Because i 0 is in x ’s left subtree, we have i 0 : low හ x: int: low. Now consider any interval i 00 in x ’s right subtree, so that x: int: low හ i 00 : low. Putting inequalities together, we get i: high < i 0 : low හ x: int: low හ i 00 : low : Because i: high < i 00 : low, the interval trichotomy tells us that i and i 00 do not overlap. Since we chose i 00 as any interval in x ’s right subtree, no node in x ’s right subtree overlaps i . Thus, the I NTERVAL-SEARCH procedure works correctly. 17.3 Interval trees 495 Exercises 17.3-1 Write pseudocode for LEFT-ROTATE that operates on nodes in an interval tree and updates all the max attributes that change in O.1/ time. 17.3-2 Describe an efûcient algorithm that, given an interval i , returns an interval over- lapping i that has the minimum low endpoint, or T: nil if no such interval exists. 17.3-3 Given an interval tree T and an interval i , describe how to list all intervals in T that overlap i in O.min fn; k lg ng/ time, where k is the number of intervals in the output list. (Hint: One simple method makes several queries, modifying the tree between queries. A slightly more complicated method does not modify the tree.) 17.3-4 Suggest modiûcations to the interval-tree procedures to support the new opera- tion I NTERVAL-SEARCH-E XACTLY .T; i /, where T is an interval tree and i is an interval. The operation should return a pointer to a node x in T such that x: int: low D i: low and x: int: high D i: high, or T: nil if T contains no such node. All operations, including I NTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY, should run in O.lg n/ time on an n-node interval tree. 17.3-5 Show how to maintain a dynamic set Q of numbers that supports the operation MIN-GAP, which gives the absolute value of the difference of the two closest num- bers in Q. For example, if we have Q D f1; 5; 9; 15; 18; 22g , then MIN-GAP.Q/ returns 3, since 15 and 18 are the two closest numbers in Q. Make the operations I NSERT, DELETE, SEARCH, and MIN-GAP as efûcient as possible, and analyze their running times. ? 17.3-6 VLSI databases commonly represent an integrated circuit as a list of rectan- gles. Assume that each rectangle is rectilinearly oriented (sides parallel to the x - and y -axes), so that each rectangle is represented by four values: its minimum and maximum x - and y -coordinates. Give an O.n lg n/-time algorithm to decide whether a set of n rectangles so represented contains two rectangles that overlap. Your algorithm need not report all intersecting pairs, but it must report that an over- lap exists if one rectangle entirely covers another, even if the boundary lines do not intersect. (Hint: Move a <sweep= line across the set of rectangles.) 496 Chapter 17 Augmenting Data Structures Problems 17-1 Point of maximum overlap You wish to keep track of a point of maximum overlap in a set of intervals4a point with the largest number of intervals in the set that overlap it. a. Show that there is always a point of maximum overlap that is an endpoint of one of the intervals. b. Design a data structure that efûciently supports the operations I NTERVAL- I NSERT, I NTERVAL-DELETE, and FIND-POM, which returns a point of max- imum overlap. (Hint: Keep a red-black tree of all the endpoints. Associate a value of C1 with each left endpoint, and associate a value of 1 with each right endpoint. Augment each node of the tree with some extra information to maintain the point of maximum overlap.) 17-2 Josephus permutation We deûne the Josephus problem as follows. A group of n people form a circle, and we are given a positive integer m හ n. Beginning with a designated ûrst person, proceed around the circle, removing every mth person. After each person is removed, counting continues around the circle that remains. This process continues until nobody remains in the circle. The order in which the people are removed from the circle deûnes the .n; m/-Josephus permutation of the integers 1; 2; : : : ; n. For example, the .7; 3/-Josephus permutation is h3; 6; 2; 7; 5; 1; 4i. a. Suppose that m is a constant. Describe an O.n/-time algorithm that, given an integer n, outputs the .n; m/-Josephus permutation. b. Suppose that m is not necessarily a constant. Describe an O.n lg n/-time algo- rithm that, given integers n and m, outputs the .n; m/-Josephus permutation. Chapter notes In their book, Preparata and Shamos [364] describe several of the interval trees that appear in the literature, citing work by H. Edelsbrunner (1980) and E. M. McCreight (1981). The book details an interval tree that, gi ven a static database of n intervals, allows us to enumerate all k intervals that overlap a given query interval in O.k C lg n/ time. 18 B-Trees B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disk drives or other direct-access secondary storage devices. B-trees are similar to red-black trees (Chapter 13), but they are better at minimizing the number of operations that access disks. (We often say just <disk= instead of <disk drive.=) Many database systems use B-trees, or variants of B-trees, to store information. B-trees differ from red-black trees in that B-tree nodes may have many children, from a few to thousands. That is, the <branching factor= of a B-tree can be quite large, although it usually depends on characteristics of the disk drive used. B-trees are similar to red-black trees in that every n-node B-tree has height O.lg n/, so that B-trees can implement many dynamic-set operations in O.lg n/ time. But a B-tree has a larger branching factor than a red-black tree, so the base of the logarithm that expresses its height is larger, and hence its height can be considerably lower. B-trees generalize binary search trees in a natural manner. Figure 18.1 shows a simple B-tree. If an internal B-tree node x contains x:n keys, then x has x:n C 1 children. The keys in node x serve as dividing points separating the range of keys handled by x into x:n C 1 subranges, each handled by one child of x . A search for a key in a B-tree makes an .x:n C 1/-way decision based on comparisons with the x:n keys stored at node x . An internal node contains pointers to its children, but a leaf node does not. Section 18.1 gives a precise deûnition of B-trees and proves that the height of a B-tree grows only logarithmically with the number of nodes it contains. Sec- tion 18.2 describes how to search for a key and insert a key into a B-tree, and Section 18.3 discusses deletion. Before proceeding, however, we need to ask why we evaluate data structures designed to work on a disk drive differently from data structures designed to work in main random-access memory. 498 Chapter 18 B-Trees M D H Q T X B C F G J K L N P R S V W Y Z T: root Figure 18.1 A B-tree whose keys are the consonants of English. An internal node x containing x: n keys has x: n C 1 children. All leaves are at the same depth in the tree. The blue nodes are examined in a search for the letter R. Data structures on secondary storage Computer systems take advantage of various technologies that provide memory capacity. The main memory of a computer system normally consists of silicon memory chips. This technology is typically more than an order of magnitude more expensive per bit stored than magnetic storage technology, such as tapes or disk drives. Most computer systems also have secondary storage based on solid-state drives (SSDs) or magnetic disk drives. The amount of such secondary storage often exceeds the amount of primary memory by one to two orders of magnitude. SSDs have faster access times than magnetic disk drives, which are mechanical devices. In recent years, SSD capacities have increased while their prices have decreased. Magnetic disk drives typically have much higher capacities than SSDs, and they remain a more cost-effective means for storing massive amounts of information. Disk drives that store several terabytes 1 can be found for under $100. Figure 18.2 shows a typical disk drive. The drive consists of one or more plat- ters, which rotate at a constant speed around a common spindle. A magnetizable material covers the surface of each platter. The drive reads and writes each plat- ter by a head at the end of an arm. The arms can move their heads toward or away from the spindle. The surface that passes underneath a given head when it is stationary is called a track. Although disk drives are cheaper and have higher capacity than main memory, they are much, much slower because they have moving mechanical parts. The mechanical motion has two components: platter rotation and arm movement. As of this writing, commodity disk drives rotate at speeds of 5400315,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Typical speeds are 15,000 RPM in server-grade drives, 7200 RPM 1 When specifying disk capacities, one terabyte is one trillion bytes, rather than 2 40 bytes. Chapter 18 B-Trees 499 platter track arms read/write head spindle Figure 18.2 A typical magnetic disk drive. It consists of one or more platters covered with a magnetizable material (two platters are shown here) that rotate around a spindle. Each platter is read and written with a head, shown in red, at the end of an arm. Arms rotate around a common pivot axis. A track, drawn in blue, is the surface that passes beneath the read/write head when the head is stationary. in drives for desktops, and 5400 RPM in drives for laptops. Although 7200 RPM may seem fast, one rotation takes 8:33 milliseconds, which is over 5 orders of magnitude longer than the 50 nanosecond access times (more or less) commonly found for main memory. In other words, if a computer waits a full rotation for a particular item to come under the read/write head, it could access main memory more than 100,000 times during that span. The average wait is only half a rotation, but still, the difference in access times for main memory compared with disk drives is enormous. Moving the arms also takes some time. As of this writing, average access times for commodity disk drives are around 4 milliseconds. In order to amortize the time spent waiting for mechanical movements, also known as latency, disk drives access not just one item but several at a time. Infor- mation is divided into a number of equal-sized blocks of bits that appear consecu- tively within tracks, and each disk read or write is of one or more entire blocks. 2 Typical disk drives have block sizes running from 512 to 4096 bytes. Once the read/write head is positioned correctly and the platter has rotated to the beginning of the desired block, reading or writing a magnetic disk drive is entirely electronic (aside from the rotation of the platter), and the disk drive can quickly read or write large amounts of data. 2 SSDs also exhibit greater latency than main memory and access data in blocks. 500 Chapter 18 B-Trees Often, accessing a block of information and reading it from a disk drive takes longer than processing all the information read. For this reason, in this chapter we’ll look separately at the two principal components of the running time:  the number of disk accesses, and  the CPU (computing) time. We measure the number of disk accesses in terms of the number of blocks of infor- mation that need to be read from or written to the disk drive. Although disk-access time is not constant4it depends on the distance between the current track and the desired track and also on the initial rotational position of the platters4the number of blocks read or written provides a good ûrst-order approximation of the total time spent accessing the disk drive. In a typical B-tree application, the amount of data handled is so large that all the data do not ût into main memory at once. The B-tree algorithms copy selected blocks from disk into main memory as needed and write back onto disk the blocks that have changed. B-tree algorithms keep only a constant number of blocks in main memory at any time, and thus the size of main memory does not limit the size of B-trees that can be handled. B-tree procedures need to be able to read information from disk into main mem- ory and write information from main memory to disk. Consider some object x . If x is currently in the computer’s main memory, then the code can refer to the attributes of x as usual: x: key, for example. If x resides on disk, however, then the procedure must perform the operation DISK-READ.x/ to read the block containing object x into main memory before it can refer to x ’s attributes. (Assume that if x is already in main memory, then DISK-READ .x/ requires no disk accesses: it is a <no-op.=) Similarly, procedures call DISK-WRITE .x/ to save any changes that have been made to the attributes of object x by writing to disk the block containing x . Thus, the typical pattern for working with an object is as follows: x D a pointer to some object DISK-READ .x/ operations that access and/or modify the attributes of x DISK-WRITE .x/ // omitted if no attributes of x were changed other operations that access but do not modify attributes of x The system can keep only a limited number of blocks in main memory at any one time. Our B-tree algorithms assume that the system automatically üushes from main memory blocks that are no longer in use. Since in most systems the running time of a B-tree algorithm depends primar- ily on the number of DISK-READ and DISK-WRITE operations it performs, we 18.1 Deﬁnition of B-trees 501 1000 1001 1 node, 1000 keys 1001 nodes, 1,001,000 keys 1,002,001 nodes, 1,002,001,000 keys 1000 1001 1000 1000 1001 … 1001 1000 1000 1000 … T: root Figure 18.3 A B-tree of height 2 containing over one billion keys. Shown inside each node x is x: n, the number of keys in x. Each internal node and leaf contains 1000 keys. This B-tree has 1001 nodes at depth 1 and over one million leaves at depth 2. typically want each of these operations to read or write as much information as possible. Thus, a B-tree node is usually as large as a whole disk block, and this size limits the number of children a B-tree node can have. Large B-trees stored on disk drives often have branching factors between 50 and 2000, depending on the size of a key relative to the size of a block. A large branching factor dramatically reduces both the height of the tree and the number of disk accesses required to ûnd any key. Figure 18.3 shows a B-tree with a branching factor of 1001 and height 2 that can store over one billion keys. Nevertheless, if the root node is kept permanently in main memory, at most two disk accesses sufûce to ûnd any key in this tree. 18.1 Deﬁnition of B-trees To keep things simple, let’s assume, as we have for binary search trees and red- black trees, that any satellite information associated with a key resides in the same node as the key. In practice, you might actually store with each key just a pointer to another disk block containing the satellite information for that key. The pseu- docode in this chapter implicitly assumes that the satellite information associated with a key, or the pointer to such satellite information, travels with the key when- ever the key is moved from node to node. A common variant on a B-tree, known as a B C -tree, stores all the satellite information in the leaves and stores only keys and child pointers in the internal nodes, thus maximizing the branching factor of the internal nodes. A B-tree T is a rooted tree with root T: root having the following properties: 502 Chapter 18 B-Trees 1. Every node x has the following attributes: a. x:n, the number of keys currently stored in node x , b. the x:n keys themselves, x: key 1 ; x: key 2 ; : : : ; x: key x: n , stored in monotoni- cally increasing order, so that x: key 1 හ x: key 2 හ    හ x: key x: n , c. x: leaf , a boolean value that is TRUE if x is a leaf and FALSE if x is an internal node. 2. Each internal node x also contains x:n C 1 pointers x:c 1 ; x:c 2 ; : : : ; x:c x: nC1 to its children. Leaf nodes have no children, and so their c i attributes are unde- ûned. 3. The keys x: key i separate the ranges of keys stored in each subtree: if k i is any key stored in the subtree with root x:c i , then k 1 හ x: key 1 හ k 2 හ x: key 2 හ    හ x: key x: n හ k x: nC1 : 4. All leaves have the same depth, which is the tree’s height h. 5. Nodes have lower and upper bounds on the number of keys they can contain, expressed in terms of a ûxed integer t  2 called the minimum degree of the B-tree: a. Every node other than the root must have at least t  1 keys. Every internal node other than the root thus has at least t children. If the tree is nonempty, the root must have at least one key. b. Every node may contain at most 2t  1 keys. Therefore, an internal node may have at most 2t children. We say that a node is full if it contains exactly 2t  1 keys. 3 The simplest B-tree occurs when t D 2. Every internal node then has either 2, 3, or 4 children, and it is a 2-3-4 tree. In practice, however, much larger values of t yield B-trees with smaller height. The height of a B-tree The number of disk accesses required for most operations on a B-tree is propor- tional to the height of the B-tree. The following theorem bounds the worst-case height of a B-tree. 3 Another common variant on a B-tree, known as a B  -tree, requires each internal node to be at least 2=3 full, rather than at least half full, as a B-tree requires. 18.1 Deﬁnition of B-trees 503 1 depth number of nodes 3 2t 2 1 2 0 1 2 2t … … t 3 1 t 3 1 t t t 3 1 t 3 1 t 3 1 t 3 1 t t t t t 3 1 t 3 1 … t 3 1 t 3 1 … t 3 1 t 3 1 … t 3 1 t 3 1 … T: root Figure 18.4 A B-tree of height 3 containing a minimum possible number of keys. Shown inside each node x is x: n. Theorem 18.1 If n  1, then for any n-key B-tree T of height h and minimum degree t  2, h හ log t n C 1 2 : Proof By deûnition, the root of a nonempty B-tree T contains at least one key, and all other nodes contain at least t  1 keys. Let h be the height of T . Then T contains at least 2 nodes at depth 1, at least 2t nodes at depth 2, at least 2t 2 nodes at depth 3, and so on, until at depth h, it has at least 2t h1 nodes. Figure 18.4 illustrates such a tree for h D 3. The number n of keys therefore satisûes the inequality  1 C .t  1/ h X i D1 2t i 1 D 1 C 2.t  1/ Ï t h  1 t  1 Ð (by equation (A.6) on page 1142) D 2t h  1 ; so that t h හ .n C 1/=2. Taking base-t logarithms of both sides proves the theo- rem. You can see the power of B-trees as compared with red-black trees. Although the height of the tree grows as O.log n/ in both cases (recall that t is a constant), for B-trees the base of the logarithm can be many times larger. Thus, B-trees save 504 Chapter 18 B-Trees a factor of about lg t over red-black trees in the number of nodes examined for most tree operations. Because examining an arbitrary node in a tree usually entails accessing the disk, B-trees avoid a substantial number of disk accesses. Exercises 18.1-1 Why isn’t a minimum degree of t D 1 allowed? 18.1-2 For what values of t is the tree of Figure 18.1 a legal B-tree? 18.1-3 Show all legal B-trees of minimum degree 2 that store the keys 1; 2; 3; 4; 5. 18.1-4 As a function of the minimum degree t , what is the maximum number of keys that can be stored in a B-tree of height h? 18.1-5 Describe the data structure that results if each black node in a red-black tree absorbs its red children, incorporating their children with its own. 18.2 Basic operations on B-trees This section presents the details of the operations B-TREE-SEARCH, B-TREE- CREATE, and B-TREE-I NSERT. These procedures observe two conventions:  The root of the B-tree is always in main memory, so that no procedure ever needs to perform a DISK-READ on the root. If any changes to the root node occur, however, then DISK-WRITE must be called on the root.  Any nodes that are passed as parameters must already have had a D ISK-READ operation performed on them. The procedures are all <one-pass= algorithms that proceed downward from the root of the tree, without having to back up. Searching a B-tree Searching a B-tree is much like searching a binary search tree, except that instead of making a binary, or <two-way,= branching decision at each node, the search 18.2 Basic operations on B-trees 505 makes a multiway branching decision according to the number of the node’s chil- dren. More precisely, at each internal node x , the search makes an .x:n C 1/-way branching decision. The procedure B-TREE-SEARCH generalizes the TREE-SEARCH procedure de- ûned for binary search trees on page 316. It takes as input a pointer to the root node x of a subtree and a key k to be searched for in that subtree. The top-level call is thus of the form B-TREE-SEARCH .T: root ; k/. If k is in the B-tree, then B-TREE-SEARCH returns the ordered pair .y; i / consisting of a node y and an index i such that y: key i D k. Otherwise, the procedure returns NIL. B-TREE-SEARCH .x; k/ 1 i D 1 2 while i හ x:n and k > x: key i 3 i D i C 1 4 if i හ x:n and k == x: key i 5 return .x; i / 6 elseif x: leaf 7 return NIL 8 else DISK-READ .x:c i / 9 return B-TREE-SEARCH .x:c i ; k/ Using a linear-search procedure, lines 133 of B-TREE-SEARCH ûnd the smallest index i such that k හ x: key i , or else they set i to x:n C 1. Lines 435 check to see whether the search has discovered the key, returning if it has. Otherwise, if x is a leaf, then line 7 terminates the search unsuccessfully, and if x is an internal node, lines 839 recurse to search the appropriate subtree of x , after performing the necessary DISK-READ on that child. Figure 18.1 illustrates the operation of B-TREE-SEARCH. The blue nodes are those examined during a search for the key R. As in the TREE-SEARCH procedure for binary search trees, the nodes encoun- tered during the recursion form a simple path downward from the root of the tree. The B-TREE-SEARCH procedure therefore accesses O.h/ D O.log t n/ disk blocks, where h is the height of the B-tree and n is the number of keys in the B-tree. Since x:n < 2t , the while loop of lines 233 takes O.t/ time within each node, and the total CPU time is O.th/ D O.t log t n/. Creating an empty B-tree To build a B-tree T , ûrst use the B-TREE-CREATE procedure on the next page to create an empty root node and then call the B-TREE-I NSERT procedure on 506 Chapter 18 B-Trees page 508 to add new keys. Both of these procedures use an auxiliary procedure ALLOCATE-NODE, whose pseudocode we omit and which allocates one disk block to be used as a new node in O.1/ time. A node created by ALLOCATE-NODE requires no DISK-READ, since there is as yet no useful information stored on the disk for that node. B-TREE-CREATE requires O.1/ disk operations and O.1/ CPU time. B-TREE-CREATE .T / 1 x D ALLOCATE-NODE ./ 2 x: leaf D TRUE 3 x:n D 0 4 DISK-WRITE .x/ 5 T: root D x Inserting a key into a B-tree Inserting a key into a B-tree is signiûcantly more complicated than inserting a key into a binary search tree. As with binary search trees, you search for the leaf position at which to insert the new key. With a B-tree, however, you cannot simply create a new leaf node and insert it, as the resulting tree would fail to be a valid B-tree. Instead, you insert the new key into an existing leaf node. Since you cannot insert a key into a leaf node that is full, you need an operation that splits a full node y (having 2t  1 keys) around its median key y: key t into two nodes having only t  1 keys each. The median key moves up into y ’s parent to identify the dividing point between the two new trees. But if y ’s parent is also full, you must split it before you can insert the new key, and thus you could end up splitting full nodes all the way up the tree. To avoid having to go back up the tree, just split every full node you encounter as you go down the tree. In this way, whenever you need to split a full node, you are assured that its parent is not full. Inserting a key into a B-tree then requires only a single pass down the tree from the root to a leaf. Splitting a node in a B-tree The procedure B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD on the facing page takes as input a nonfull internal node x (assumed to reside in main memory) and an index i such that x:c i (also assumed to reside in main memory) is a full child of x . The procedure splits this child in two and adjusts x so that it has an additional child. To split a full root, you ûrst need to make the root a child of a new empty root node, so that you can 18.2 Basic operations on B-trees 507 use B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD. The tree thus grows in height by 1: splitting is the only means by which the tree grows taller.

B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD splits the full node y D x:c i about its median key (S in the ûgure), which moves up into y ’s parent node x . Those keys in y that are greater than the median key move into a new node ´, which becomes a new child of x . B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD works by straightforward cutting and pasting. Node x is the parent of the node y being split, which is x ’s i th child (set in line 1). Node y originally has 2t children and 2t  1 keys, but splitting reduces y to t children and t  1 keys. The t largest children and t  1 keys of node y move over to node ´, which becomes a new child of x , positioned just after y in x ’s table of children. The median key of y moves up to become the key in node x that separates the pointers to nodes y and ´. Lines 2–9 create node ´ and give it the largest t  1 keys and, if y and ´ are internal nodes, the corresponding t children of y . Line 10 adjusts the key count for y . Then, lines 11317 shift keys and child pointers in x to the right in order to make room for x ’s new child, insert ´ as a new child of x , move the median key 508 Chapter 18 B-Trees N W … … N W S … … R S T Q P U V R Q P T U V x x T 1 T 1 T 2 T 2 T 3 T 3 T 4 T 4 T 5 T 5 T 6 T 6 T 7 T 7 T 8 T 8 y D x:c i y D x:c i ´ D x:c i C1 x : k e y i  1 x : k e y i  1 x : k e y i x : k e y i x : k e y i C 1 Figure 18.5 Splitting a node with t D 4.

Lines 18320 write out all modiûed disk blocks. The CPU time used by B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD is ‚.t/, due to the for loops in lines 536 and 839. (The for loops in lines 11312 and 14315 also run for O.t/ iterations.) The procedure performs O.1/ disk operations. Inserting a key into a B-tree in a single pass down the tree Inserting a key k into a B-tree T of height h requires just a single pass down the tree and O.h/ disk accesses. The CPU time required is O.th/ D O.t log t n/. The B-TREE-I NSERT procedure uses B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD to guarantee that the recursion never descends to a full node. If the root is full, B-TREE-I NSERT splits it by calling the procedure B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT on the facing page. B-TREE-I NSERT .T; k/ 1 r D T: root 2 if r: n == 2t  1 3 s D B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT .T / 4 B-TREE-I NSERT-NONFULL .s; k/ 5 else B-TREE-I NSERT-NONFULL .r; k/ B-TREE-I NSERT works as follows. If the root is full, then line 3 calls B-TREE- SPLIT-ROOT in line 3 to split it. A new node s (with two children) becomes the root and is returned by B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT. Splitting the root, illustrated in Figure 18.6, is the only way to increase the height of a B-tree. Unlike a binary search tree, a B-tree increases in height at the top instead of at the bottom. Re- gardless of whether the root split, B-TREE-I NSERT ûnishes by calling B-TREE- I NSERT-NONFULL to insert key k into the tree rooted at the nonfull root node, 18.2 Basic operations on B-trees 509 T 8 T 7 T 6 T 5 T 4 T 3 T 2 T 1 F H L D A N P s H r T 8 T 7 T 6 T 5 T 4 T 3 T 2 T 1 F D A L N P r T: root T: root Figure 18.6 Splitting the root with t D 4.

B-TREE- I NSERT-NONFULL recurses as necessary down the tree, at all times guaranteeing that the node to which it recurses is not full by calling B-T REE-SPLIT-CHILD as necessary. The operation of B-TREE-I NSERT and the recursive operation of B-TREE-I NSERT-NONFULL guarantee that this assumption is true. Figure 18.7 illustrates the various cases of how B-TREE-I NSERT-NONFULL in- serts a key into a B-tree. Lines 338 handle the case in which x is a leaf node by inserting key k into x , shifting to the right all keys in x that are greater than k.

(Note that DISK-READ.x:c i / is not needed after line 16 incre- ments i , since the recursion descends in this case to a child that was just created by B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD.) The net effect of lines 13316 is thus to guarantee that the procedure never recurses to a full node. Line 17 then recurses to insert k into the appropriate subtree. For a B-tree of height h, B-TREE-I NSERT performs O.h/ disk accesses, since only O.1/ DISK-READ and DISK-WRITE operations occur at each level of the tree. The total CPU time used is O.t/ in each level of the tree, or O.th/ D O.t log t n/ overall. Since B-TREE-I NSERT-NONFULL is tail-recursive, you can instead implement it with a while loop, thereby demonstrating that the number of blocks that need to be in main memory at any time is O.1/.

Show how to modify the procedures for creating and inserting into a B-tree to handle this variation. 18.2-6 Suppose that you implement B-T REE-SEARCH to use binary search rather than linear search within each node. Show that this change makes the required CPU time O.lg n/, independent of how t might be chosen as a function of n. 18.2-7 Suppose that disk hardware allows you to choose the size of a disk block arbitrarily, but that the time it takes to read the disk block is a Cbt , where a and b are speciûed constants and t is the minimum degree for a B-tree using blocks of the selected size. Describe how to choose t so as to minimize (approximately) the B-tree search time. Suggest an optimal value of t for the case in which a D 5 milliseconds and b D 10 microseconds. 18.3 Deleting a key from a B-tree 513 18.3 Deleting a key from a B-tree Deletion from a B-tree is analogous to insertion but a little more complicated, be- cause you can delete a key from any node4not just a leaf4and when you delete a key from an internal node, you must rearrange the node’s children. As in in- sertion, you must guard against deletion producing a tree whose structure violates the B-tree properties. Just as a node should not get too big due to insertion, a node must not get too small during deletion (except that the root is allowed to have fewer than the minimum number t  1 of keys). And just as a simple insertion algorithm might have to back up if a node on the path to where the key is to be inserted is full, a simple approach to deletion might have to back up if a node (other than the root) along the path to where the key is to be deleted has the minimum number of keys. The procedure B-TREE-DELETE deletes the key k from the subtree rooted at x . Unlike the procedures TREE-DELETE on page 325 and RB-DELETE on page 348, which are given the node to delete4presumably as the result of a prior search4 B-TREE-DELETE combines the search for key k with the deletion process. Why do we combine search and deletion in B-TREE-DELETE? Just as B-TREE-I NSERT prevents any node from becoming overfull (having more than 2t  1 keys) while making a single pass down the tree, B-TREE-DELETE prevents any node from becoming underfull (having fewer than t  1 keys) while also making a single pass down the tree, searching for and ultimately deleting the key. To prevent any node from becoming underfull, the design of B- TREE-DELETE guarantees that whenever it calls itself recursively on a node x , the number of keys in x is at least the minimum degree t at the time of the call. (Although the root may have fewer than t keys and a recursive call may be made from the root, no recursive call is made on the root.) This condition requires one more key than the minimum required by the usual B-tree conditions, and so a key might have to be moved from x into one of its child nodes (still leaving x with at least the minimum t  1 keys) before a recursive call is made on that child, thus allowing deletion to occur in one downward pass without having to traverse back up the tree. We describe how the procedure B-TREE-DELETE .T; k/ deletes a key k from a B-tree T instead of presenting detailed pseudocode. We examine three cases, illustrated in Figure 18.8. The cases are for when the search arrives at a leaf, at an internal node containing key k, and at an internal node not containing key k. As mentioned above, in all three cases node x has at least t keys (with the possible exception of when x is the root). Cases 2 and 34when x is an internal node4 guarantee this property as the recursion descends through the B-tree. 514 Chapter 18 B-Trees (a) P initial tree (b) P F deleted: case 1 (c) P M deleted: case 2a M G C X T J K N O D E B A U V Y Z R S Q L F M G C X T J K N O D E B A U V Y Z R S Q L G C L X T J K N O D E B A U V Y Z R S Q Figure 18.8 Deleting keys from a B-tree. The minimum degree for this B-tree is t D 3, so that, other than the root, every node must have at least 2 keys. Blue nodes are those that are modiûed by the deletion process.

(c) Deletion of M , which is case 2a: the predecessor L of M moves up to take M ’s position. Case 1: The search arrives at a leaf node x . If x contains key k, then delete k from x . If x does not contain key k, then k was not in the B-tree and nothing else needs to be done. Case 2: The search arrives at an internal node x that contains key k. Let k D x: key i . One of the following three cases applies, depending on the number of keys in x:c i (the child of x that precedes k) and x:c i C1 (the child of x that follows k). Case 2a: x:c i has at least t keys. Find the predecessor k 0 of k in the subtree rooted at x:c i . Recursively delete k 0 from x:c i , and replace k by k 0 in x . (Key k 0 can be found and deleted in a single downward pass.) Case 2b: x:c i has t  1 keys and x:c i C1 has at least t keys. This case is sym- metric to case 2a. Find the successor k 0 of k in the subtree rooted at x:c i C1 . 18.3 Deleting a key from a B-tree 515 (e) D deleted: case 3b C L P X T L P X T (f) B deleted: case 3a E (eʹ) tree shrinks in height (d) P G deleted: case 2c C L X T J K N O D E B A U V Y Z R S Q C L P X T J K N O E B A U V Y Z R S Q J K N O E B A U V Y Z R S Q J K N O A U V Y Z C R S Q Figure 18.8, continued (d) Deletion of G, which is case 2c: push G down to make node DEGJK and then delete G from this leaf (case 1).

Then delete D from a leaf (case 1). (e 0 ) After (e), delete the empty root. The tree shrinks in height by 1. (f) Deletion of B, which is case 3a: C moves to ûll B’s position and E moves to ûll C ’s position. Recursively delete k 0 from x:c i C1 , and replace k by k 0 in x . (Again, ûnding and deleting k 0 can be done in a single downward pass.) Case 2c: Both x:c i and x:c i C1 have t  1 keys. Merge k and all of x:c i C1 into x:c i , so that x loses both k and the pointer to x:c i C1 , and x:c i now contains 2t  1 keys. Then free x:c i C1 and recursively delete k from x:c i . Case 3: The search arrives at an internal node x that does not contain key k. Continue searching down the tree while ensuring that each node visited has at least t keys. To do so, determine the root x:c i of the appropriate subtree that must contain k, if k is in the tree at all. If x:c i has only t  1 keys, execute 516 Chapter 18 B-Trees case 3a or 3b as necessary to guarantee descending to a node containing at least t keys. Then ûnish by recursing on the appropriate child of x . Case 3a: x:c i has only t  1 keys but has an immediate sibling with at least t keys. Give x:c i an extra key by moving a key from x down into x:c i , moving a key from x:c i ’s immediate left or right sibling up into x , and moving the appropriate child pointer from the sibling into x:c i . Case 3b: x:c i and each of x:c i ’s immediate siblings have t  1 keys. (It is possible for x:c i to have either one or two siblings.) Merge x:c i with one sibling, which involves moving a key from x down into the new merged node to become the median key for that node. In cases 2c and 3b, if node x is the root, it could end up having no keys. When this situation occurs, then x is deleted, and x ’s only child x:c 1 becomes the new root of the tree. This action decreases the height of the tree by one and preserves the property that the root of the tree contains at least one key (unless the tree is empty). Since most of the keys in a B-tree are in the leaves, deletion operations often end up deleting keys from leaves. The B-TREE-DELETE procedure then acts in one downward pass through the tree, without having to back up. When deleting a key in an internal node x , however, the procedure might make a downward pass through the tree to ûnd the key’s predecessor or successor and then return to node x to replace the key with its predecessor or successor (cases 2a and 2b). Returning to node x does not require a traversal through all the levels between x and the node containing the predecessor or successor, however, since the procedure can just keep a pointer to x and the key position within x and put the predecessor or successor key directly there. Although this procedure seems complicated, it involves only O.h/ disk oper- ations for a B-tree of height h, since only O.1/ calls to DISK-READ and DISK- WRITE are made between recursive invocations of the procedure. The CPU time required is O.th/ D O.t log t n/. Exercises 18.3-1 Show the results of deleting C , P , and V , in order, from the tree of Figure 18.8(f). 18.3-2 Write pseudocode for B-TREE-DELETE. Problems for Chapter 18 517 Problems 18-1 Stacks on secondary storage Consider implementing a stack in a computer that has a relatively small amount of fast primary memory and a relatively large amount of slower disk storage. The operations PUSH and POP work on single-word values. The stack can grow to be much larger than can ût in memory, and thus most of it must be stored on disk. A simple, but inefûcient, stack implementation keeps the entire stack on disk. Maintain in memory a stack pointer, which is the disk address of the top element on the stack. Indexing block numbers and word offsets within blocks from 0, if the pointer has value p, the top element is the .p mod m/th word on block bp=mc of the disk, where m is the number of words per block. To implement the PUSH operation, increment the stack pointer, read the appro- priate block into memory from disk, copy the element to be pushed to the appropri- ate word on the block, and write the block back to disk. A P OP operation is similar. Read in the appropriate block from disk, save the top of the stack, decrement the stack pointer, and return the saved value. You need not write back the block, since it was not modiûed, and the word in the block that contained the popped value is ignored. As in the analyses of B-tree operations, two costs matter: the total number of disk accesses and the total CPU time. A disk access also incurs a cost in CPU time. In particular, any disk access to a block of m words incurs charges of one disk access and ‚.m/ CPU time. a. Asymptotically, what is the worst-case number of disk accesses for n stack operations using this simple implementation? What is the CPU time for n stack operations? Express your answer in terms of m and n for this and subsequent parts. Now consider a stack implementation in which you keep one block of the stack in memory. (You also maintain a small amount of memory to record which block is currently in memory.) You can perform a stack operation only if the relevant disk block resides in memory. If necessary, you can write the block currently in memory to the disk and read the new block from the disk into memory. If the relevant disk block is already in memory, then no disk accesses are required. b. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n PUSH opera- tions? What is the CPU time? c. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n stack operations? What is the CPU time? 518 Chapter 18 B-Trees Suppose that you now implement the stack by keeping two blocks in memory (in addition to a small number of words for bookkeeping). d. Describe how to manage the stack blocks so that the amortized number of disk accesses for any stack operation is O.1=m/ and the amortized CPU time for any stack operation is O.1/. 18-2 Joining and splitting 2-3-4 trees The join operation takes two dynamic sets S 0 and S 00 and an element x such that x 0 : key < x: key < x 00 : key for any x 0 2 S 0 and x 00 2 S 00 . It returns a set S D S 0 [ fx g [ S 00 . The split operation is like an <inverse= join: given a dynamic set S and an element x 2 S , it creates a set S 0 that consists of all elements in S  fx g whose keys are less than x: key and another set S 00 that consists of all elements in S  fx g whose keys are greater than x: key. This problem investigates how to implement these operations on 2-3-4 trees (B-trees with t D 2). Assume for convenience that elements consist only of keys and that all key values are distinct. a. Show how to maintain, for every node x of a 2-3-4 tree, the height of the subtree rooted at x as an attribute x: height . Make sure that your implementation does not affect the asymptotic running times of searching, insertion, and deletion. b. Show how to implement the join operation. Given two 2-3-4 trees T 0 and T 00 and a key k, the join operation should run in O.1 C jh 0  h 00 j/ time, where h 0 and h 00 are the heights of T 0 and T 00 , respectively. c. Consider the simple path p from the root of a 2-3-4 tree T to a given key k, the set S 0 of keys in T that are less than k, and the set S 00 of keys in T that are greater than k. Show that p breaks S 0 into a set of trees fT 0 0 ; T 0 1 ; : : : ; T 0 m g and a set of keys fk 0 1 ; k 0 2 ; : : : ; k 0 m g such that y < k 0 i < ´ for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m and any keys y 2 T 0 i 1 and ´ 2 T 0 i . What is the relationship between the heights of T 0 i 1 and T 0 i ? Describe how p breaks S 00 into sets of trees and keys. d. Show how to implement the split operation on T . Use the join operation to assemble the keys in S 0 into a single 2-3-4 tree T 0 and the keys in S 00 into a single 2-3-4 tree T 00 . The running time of the split operation should be O.lg n/, where n is the number of keys in T . (Hint: The costs for joining should tele- scope.) Notes for Chapter 18 519 Chapter notes Knuth [261], Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5], and Sedgewick and Wayne [402] give further discussions of balanced-tree schemes and B-trees. Comer [99] pro- vides a comprehensive survey of B-trees. Guibas and Sedgewick [202] discuss the relationships among various kinds of balanced-tree schemes, including red-black trees and 2-3-4 trees. In 1970, J. E. Hopcroft invented 2-3 trees, a precursor to B-trees and 2-3-4 trees, in which every internal node has either two or three children. Bayer and McCreight [39] introduced B-trees in 1972 with no explanation of their choice of name. Bender, Demaine, and Farach-Colton [47] studied how to make B-trees perform well in the presence of memory-hierarchy effects. Their cache-oblivious algo- rithms work efûciently without explicitly knowing the data transfer sizes within the memory hierarchy. 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets Some applications involve grouping n distinct elements into a collection of dis- joint sets4sets with no elements in common. These applications often need to perform two operations in particular: ûnding the unique set that contains a given element and uniting two sets. This chapter explores methods for maintaining a data structure that supports these operations. Section 19.1 describes the operations supported by a disjoint-set data structure and presents a simple application. Section 19.2 looks at a simple linked-list imple- mentation for disjoint sets. Section 19.3 presents a more efûcient representation using rooted trees. The running time using the tree representation is theoretically superlinear, but for all practical purposes it is linear. Section 19.4 deûnes and dis- cusses a very quickly growing function and its very slowly growing inverse, which appears in the running time of operations on the tree-based implementation, and then, by a complex amortized analysis, proves an upper bound on the running time that is just barely superlinear. 19.1 Disjoint-set operations A disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection S D fS 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S k g of dis- joint dynamic sets. To identify each set, choose a representative, which is some member of the set. In some applications, it doesn’t matter which member is used as the representative; it matters only that if you ask for the representative of a dy- namic set twice without modifying the set between the requests, you get the same answer both times. Other applications may require a prespeciûed rule for choosing the representative, such as choosing the smallest member in the set (for a set whose elements can be ordered). 19.1 Disjoint-set operations 521 As in the other dynamic-set implementations we have studied, each element of a set is represented by an object. Letting x denote an object, we’ll see how to support the following operations: MAKE-SET .x/, where x does not already belong to some other set, creates a new set whose only member (and thus representative) is x . UNION.x; y/ unites two disjoint, dynamic sets that contain x and y , say S x and S y , into a new set that is the union of these two sets. The representative of the result- ing set is any member of S x [ S y , although many implementations of UNION speciûcally choose the representative of either S x or S y as the new representa- tive. Since the sets in the collection must at all times be disjoint, the UNION operation destroys sets S x and S y , removing them from the collection S . In practice, implementations often absorb the elements of one of the sets into the other set. FIND-SET.x/ returns a pointer to the representative of the unique set containing x . Throughout this chapter, we’ll analyze the running times of disjoint-set data structures in terms of two parameters: n, the number of MAKE-SET operations, and m, the total number of MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations. Be- cause the total number of operations m includes the n MAKE-SET operations, m  n. The ûrst n operations are always MAKE-SET operations, so that after the ûrst n operations, the collection consists of n singleton sets. Since the sets are disjoint at all times, each UNION operation reduces the number of sets by 1. After n  1 UNION operations, therefore, only one set remains, and so at most n  1 UNION operations can occur. An application of disjoint-set data structures One of the many applications of disjoint-set data structures arises in determin- ing the connected components of an undirected graph (see Section B.4). Fig- ure 19.1(a), for example, shows a graph with four connected components. The procedure CONNECTED-COMPONENTS on the following page uses the disjoint-set operations to compute the connected components of a graph. Once the CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure has preprocessed the graph, the pro- cedure SAME-COMPONENT answers queries about whether two vertices belong to the same connected component. In pseudocode, we denote the set of vertices of a graph G by G: V and the set of edges by G: E. The procedure CONNECTED-COMPONENTS initially places each vertex v in its own set. Then, for each edge .u; v/, it unites the sets containing u and v. By Exercise 19.1-2, after all the edges are processed, two vertices belong to the same connected component if and only if the objects corresponding to the vertices belong 522 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets a b c d f g e h i j Edge processed initial sets (b, d) (e, f) (a, c) (h, i) (a, b) (f, g) (b, c) {a, b, c, d} {a, b, c, d} {a, c} {a, c} {a} {a} {a} {a, b, c, d} {b, d} {b, d} {b, d} {b, d} {b} {c} {c} {c} {d} {e, f, g} {e, f, g} {e, f} {e} {e} {f} {f} {g} {g} {h, i} {h, i} {h, i} {h, i} {h} {h} {h} {h} {i} {i} {i} {i} {j} {j} {j} {j} {j} {j} {j} {j} Collection of disjoint sets (a) (b) {g} {e, f} {g} {e, f} {g} {e, f} {g} Figure 19.1 (a) A graph with four connected components: fa; b; c; d g, fe; f; gg, fh; i g, and fj g.

Thus CONNECTED-COMPONENTS computes sets in such a way that the procedure SAME-COMPONENT can determine whether two vertices are in the same connected component. Figure 19.1(b) illustrates how CONNECTED- COMPONENTS computes the disjoint sets. In an actual implementation of this connected-components algorithm, the repre- sentations of the graph and the disjoint-set data structure would need to reference each other. That is, an object representing a vertex would contain a pointer to the corresponding disjoint-set object, and vice versa. Since these programming details depend on the implementation language, we do not address them further here. When the edges of the graph are static4not changing over time4depth-ûrst search can compute the connected components faster (see Exercise 20.3-12 on 19.2 Linked-list representation of disjoint sets 523 page 572). Sometimes, however, the edges are added dynamically, with the con- nected components updated as each edge is added. In this case, the implementation given here can be more efûcient than running a new depth-ûrst search for each new edge. Exercises 19.1-1 The CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure is run on the undirected graph G D .V; E/, where V D fa; b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i; j; kg , and the edges of E are pro- cessed in the order .d; i /; .f; k/; .g; i /; .b; g/; .a; h/; .i; j /; .d; k/; .b; j /; .d; f /; .g; j /; .a; e/. List the vertices in each connected component after each iteration of lines 335. 19.1-2 Show that after all edges are processed by C ONNECTED-COMPONENTS, two ver- tices belong to the same connected component if and only if they belong to the same set. 19.1-3 During the execution of CONNECTED-COMPONENTS on an undirected graph G D .V; E/ with k connected components, how many times is F IND-SET called? How many times is UNION called? Express your answers in terms of jV j, jEj, and k. 19.2 Linked-list representation of disjoint sets Figure 19.2(a) shows a simple way to implement a disjoint-set data structure: each set is represented by its own linked list. The object for each set has attributes head, pointing to the ûrst object in the list, and tail, pointing to the last object. Each object in the list contains a set member, a pointer to the next object in the list, and a pointer back to the set object. Within each linked list, the objects may appear in any order. The representative is the set member in the ûrst object in the list. With this linked-list representation, both MAKE-SET and FIND-SET require only O.1/ time. To carry out MAKE-SET .x/, create a new linked list whose only object is x . For FIND-SET .x/, just follow the pointer from x back to its set ob- ject and then return the member in the object that head points to. For example, in Figure 19.2(a), the call FIND-SET .g/ returns f . 524 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets f g d c h e b (a) (b) head tail S 1 c h e head tail S 2 b f g d head tail S 1 Figure 19.2 (a) Linked-list representations of two sets. Set S 1 contains members d , f , and g, with representative f , and set S 2 contains members b, c, e, and h, with representative c. Each object in the list contains a set member, a pointer to the next object in the list, and a pointer back to the set object. Each set object has pointers head and tail to the ûrst and last objects, respectively. (b) The result of UNION.g; e/, which appends the linked list containing e to the linked list containing g. The representative of the resulting set is f . The set object for e’s list, S 2 , is destroyed. A simple implementation of union The simplest implementation of the UNION operation using the linked-list set rep- resentation takes signiûcantly more time than MAKE-SET or FIND-SET. As Fig- ure 19.2(b) shows, the operation UNION.x; y/ appends y ’s list onto the end of x ’s list. The representative of x ’s list becomes the representative of the resulting set. To quickly ûnd where to append y ’s list, use the tail pointer for x ’s list. Because all members of y ’s list join x ’s list, the UNION operation destroys the set object for y ’s list. The UNION operation is where this implementation pays the price for FIND-SET taking constant time: UNION must also update the pointer to the set object for each object originally on y ’s list, which takes time linear in the length of y ’s list. In Figure 19.2, for example, the operation UNION.g; e/ causes pointers to be updated in the objects for b, c , e, and h. In fact, we can construct a sequence of m operations on n objects that requires ‚.n 2 / time. Starting with objects x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n , execute the sequence of n MAKE- SET operations followed by n  1 UNION operations shown in Figure 19.3, so that m D 2n 1. The n MAKE-SET operations take ‚.n/ time. Because the i th UNION operation updates i objects, the total number of objects updated by all n  1 UNION operations forms an arithmetic series: 19.2 Linked-list representation of disjoint sets 525 Operation Number of objects updated MAKE-SET.x 1 / 1 MAKE-SET.x 2 / 1 : : : : : : MAKE-SET.x n / 1 UNION.x 2 ; x 1 / 1 UNION.x 3 ; x 2 / 2 UNION.x 4 ; x 3 / 3 : : : : : : UNION.x n ; x n1 / n  1 Figure 19.3 A sequence of 2n  1 operations on n objects that takes ‚.n 2 / time, or ‚.n/ time per operation on average, using the linked-list set representation and the simple implementation of UNION. n1 X i D1 i D ‚.n 2 / : The total number of operations is 2n  1, and so each operation on average requires ‚.n/ time.

A weighted-union heuristic In the worst case, the above implementation of U NION requires an average of ‚.n/ time per call, because it might be appending a longer list onto a shorter list, and the procedure must update the pointer to the set object for each member of the longer list. Suppose instead that each list also includes the length of the list (which can be maintained straightforwardly with constant overhead) and that the U NION procedure always appends the shorter list onto the longer, breaking ties arbitrarily. With this simple weighted-union heuristic, a single UNION operation can still take �.n/ time if both sets have �.n/ members. As the following theorem shows, however, a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, takes O.m C n lg n/ time. Theorem 19.1 Using the linked-list representation of disjoint sets and the weighted-union heuris- tic, a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, takes O.m C n lg n/ time. Proof Because each UNION operation unites two disjoint sets, at most n  1 UNION operations occur over all. We now bound the total time taken by these 526 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets UNION operations. We start by determining, for each object, an upper bound on the number of times the object’s pointer back to its set object is updated. Consider a particular object x . Each time x ’s pointer is updated, x must have started in the smaller set. The ûrst time x ’s pointer is updated, therefore, the resulting set must have at least 2 members. Similarly, the next time x ’s pointer is updated, the resulting set must have had at least 4 members. Continuing on, for any k හ n, after x ’s pointer has been updated dlg ke times, the resulting set must have at least k members. Since the largest set has at most n members, each object’s pointer is updated at most dlg ne times over all the UNION operations. Thus the total time spent updating object pointers over all U NION operations is O.n lg n/. We must also account for updating the tail pointers and the list lengths, which take only ‚.1/ time per UNION operation. The total time spent in all UNION operations is thus O.n lg n/. The time for the entire sequence of m operations follows. Each MAKE-SET and FIND-SET operation takes O.1/ time, and there are O.m/ of them. The total time for the entire sequence is thus O.m C n lg n/.

Show that the professor’s suspicion is well founded by describing how to represent each set by a linked list such that each operation has the same running time as the operations described in this section. Describe also how the operations work. Your scheme should allow for the weighted-union heuristic, with the same effect as described in this section. (Hint: Use the tail of a linked list as its set’s representative.) 19.2-6 Suggest a simple change to the UNION procedure for the linked-list representation that removes the need to keep the tail pointer to the last object in each list. Re- gardless of whether the weighted-union heuristic is used, your change should not change the asymptotic running time of the U NION procedure. (Hint: Rather than appending one list to another, splice them together.) 19.3 Disjoint-set forests A faster implementation of disjoint sets represents sets by rooted trees, with each node containing one member and each tree representing one set. In a disjoint-set forest, illustrated in Figure 19.4(a), each member points only to its parent. The root of each tree contains the representative and is its own parent. As we’ll see, although the straightforward algorithms that use this representation are no faster than ones that use the linked-list representation, two heuristics4<union by rank= and <path compression=4yield an asymptotically optimal disjoint-set data structure. The three disjoint-set operations have simple implementations. A MAKE-SET operation simply creates a tree with just one node. A FIND-SET operation follows parent pointers until it reaches the root of the tree. The nodes visited on this sim- 528 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets h e d (a) c h e d (b) c f f Figure 19.4 A disjoint-set forest. (a) Trees representing the two sets of Figure 19.2.

(b) The result of UNION.e; g/. ple path toward the root constitute the ûnd path. A UNION operation, shown in Figure 19.4(b), simply causes the root of one tree to point to the root of the other. Heuristics to improve the running time So far, disjoint-set forests have not improved on the linked-list implementation. A sequence of n  1 UNION operations could create a tree that is just a linear chain of n nodes. By using two heuristics, however, we can achieve a running time that is almost linear in the total number m of operations. The ûrst heuristic, union by rank, is similar to the weighted-union heuristic we used with the linked-list representation. The common-sense approach is to make the root of the tree with fewer nodes point to the root of the tree with more nodes. Rather than explicitly keeping track of the size of the subtree rooted at each node, however, we’ll adopt an approach that eases the analysis. For each node, maintain a rank, which is an upper bound on the height of the node. Union by rank makes the root with smaller rank point to the root with larger rank during a UNION operation. The second heuristic, path compression, is also quite simple and highly effec- tive. As shown in Figure 19.5, FIND-SET operations use it to make each node on the ûnd path point directly to the root. Path compression does not change any ranks. Pseudocode for disjoint-set forests The union-by-rank heuristic requires its implementation to keep track of ranks. With each node x , maintain the integer value x: rank, which is an upper bound on the height of x (the number of edges in the longest simple path from a descen- dant leaf to x ). When MAKE-SET creates a singleton set, the single node in the 19.3 Disjoint-set forests 529 a b c d e f a b c d e f (a) (b) Figure 19.5 Path compression during the operation F IND-SET.

Each node has a pointer to its parent. (b) The same set after executing FIND-SET.a/. Each node on the ûnd path now points directly to the root. corresponding tree has an initial rank of 0. Each FIND-SET operation leaves all ranks unchanged. The UNION operation has two cases, depending on whether the roots of the trees have equal rank. If the roots have unequal ranks, make the root with higher rank the parent of the root with lower rank, but don’t change the ranks themselves. If the roots have equal ranks, arbitrarily choose one of the roots as the parent and increment its rank. Let’s put this method into pseudocode, appearing on the next page. The parent of node x is denoted by x: p. The LINK procedure, a subroutine called by UNION, takes pointers to two roots as inputs. The FIND-SET procedure with path compres- sion, implemented recursively, turns out to be quite simple. The FIND-SET procedure is a two-pass method: as it recurses, it makes one pass up the ûnd path to ûnd the root, and as the recursion unwinds, it makes a second pass back down the ûnd path to update each node to point directly to the root. Each call of FIND-SET.x/ returns x: p in line 3. If x is the root, then FIND-SET skips line 2 and just returns x: p, which is x . In this case the recursion bottoms out. Otherwise, line 2 executes, and the recursive call with parameter x: p returns 530 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets MAKE-SET .x/ 1 x: p D x 2 x: rank D 0 UNION.x; y/ 1 LINK.FIND-SET .x/; FIND-SET.y// LINK.x; y/ 1 if x: rank > y: rank 2 y: p D x 3 else x: p D y 4 if x: rank == y: rank 5 y: rank D y: rank C 1 FIND-SET .x/ 1 if x ¤ x: p // not the root? 2 x: p D FIND-SET .x: p/ // the root becomes the parent 3 return x: p // return the root a pointer to the root. Line 2 updates node x to point directly to the root, and line 3 returns this pointer. Effect of the heuristics on the running time Separately, either union by rank or path compression improves the running time of the operations on disjoint-set forests, and combining the two heuristics yields an even greater improvement. Alone, union by rank yields a running time of O.m lg n/ for a sequence of m operations, n of which are MAKE-SET (see Ex- ercise 19.4-4), and this bound is tight (see Exercise 19.3-3). Although we won’t prove it here, for a sequence of n MAKE-SET operations (and hence at most n  1 UNION operations) and f FIND-SET operations, the worst-case running time using only the path-compression heuristic is ‚.n C f  .1 C log 2Cf =n n//. Combining union by rank and path compression gives a worst-case running time of O.m ˛.n// , where ˛.n/ is a very slowly growing function, deûned in Sec- tion 19.4. In any conceivable application of a disjoint-set data structure, ˛.n/ හ 4, and thus, its running time is as good as linear in m for all practical purposes. Math- ematically speaking, however, it is superlinear. Section 19.4 proves this O.m˛.n// upper bound. 19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression 531 Exercises 19.3-1 Redo Exercise 19.2-2 using a disjoint-set forest with union by rank and path com- pression.

Show how to add just a single attribute to each node in a disjoint-set forest so that PRINT-SET .x/ takes time linear in the number of members of x ’s set and the asymptotic running times of the other operations are unchanged. Assume that you can print each member of the set in O.1/ time. ? 19.3-5 Show that any sequence of m MAKE-SET, FIND-SET, and LINK operations, where all the LINK operations appear before any of the F IND-SET operations, takes only O.m/ time when using both path compression and union by rank. You may assume that the arguments to LINK are roots within the disjoint-set forest. What happens in the same situation when using only path compression and not union by rank? ? 19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression As noted in Section 19.3, the combined union-by-rank and path-compression heu- ristic runs in O.m ˛.n// time for m disjoint-set operations on n elements. In this section, we’ll explore the function ˛ to see just how slowly it grows. Then we’ll analyze the running time using the potential method of amortized analysis. A very quickly growing function and its very slowly growing inverse For integers j; k  0, we deûne the function A k .j / as 532 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets A k .j / D ( j C 1 if k D 0 ; A .j C1/ k1 .j / if k  1 ; (19.1) where the expression A .j C1/ k1 .j / uses the functional-iteration notation deûned in equation (3.30) on page 68. Speciûcally, equation (3.30) gives A .0/ k1 .j / D j and A .i / k1 .j / D A k1 .A .i 1/ k1 .j // for i  1. We call the parameter k the level of the function A. The function A k .j / strictly increases with both j and k. To see just how quickly this function grows, we ûrst obtain closed-form expressions for A 1 .j / and A 2 .j /. Lemma 19.2 For any integer j  1, we have A 1 .j / D 2j C 1. Proof We ûrst use induction on i to show that A .i / 0 .j / D j Ci . For the base case, A .0/ 0 .j / D j D j C 0.

Finally, we note that A 1 .j / D A .j C1/ 0 .j / D j C .j C 1/ D 2j C 1. Lemma 19.3 For any integer j  1, we have A 2 .j / D 2 j C1 .j C 1/  1.

For the inductive step, assume that A .i 1/ 1 .j / D 2 i 1 .j C 1/  1. Then A .i / 1 .j / D A 1 .A .i 1/ 1 .j // D A 1 .2 i 1 .j C 1/  1/ D 2 .2 i 1 .j C1/ 1/ C1 D 2 i .j C1/ 2C1 D 2 i .j C1/ 1. Finally, we note that A 2 .j / D A .j C1/ 1 .j / D 2 j C1 .j C 1/  1. Now we can see how quickly A k .j / grows by simply examining A k .1/ for levels k D 0; 1; 2; 3; 4.

Properties of ranks In the remainder of this section, we prove an O.m˛.n// bound on the running time of the disjoint-set operations with union by rank and path compression. In order to prove this bound, we ûrst prove some simple properties of ranks. Lemma 19.4 For all nodes x , we have x: rank හ x: p: rank, with strict inequality if x ¤ x: p (x is not a root). The value of x: rank is initially 0, increases through time until x ¤ x: p, 534 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets and from then on, x: rank does not change. The value of x: p: rank monotonically increases over time. Proof The proof is a straightforward induction on the number of operations, us- ing the implementations of MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET that appear on page 530, and is left as Exercise 19.4-1. Corollary 19.5 On the simple path from any node going up toward a root, node ranks strictly increase. Lemma 19.6 Every node has rank at most n  1. Proof Each node’s rank starts at 0, and it increases only upon L INK operations. Because there are at most n  1 UNION operations, there are also at most n  1 LINK operations. Because each LINK operation either leaves all ranks alone or increases some node’s rank by 1, all ranks are at most n  1. Lemma 19.6 provides a weak bound on ranks. In fact, every node has rank at most blg nc (see Exercise 19.4-2). The looser bound of Lemma 19.6 sufûces for our purposes, however. Proving the time bound In order to prove the O.m ˛.n// time bound, we’ll use the potential method of amortized analysis from Section 16.3. In performing the amortized analysis, it will be convenient to assume that we invoke the L INK operation rather than the UNION operation. That is, since the parameters of the L INK procedure are pointers to two roots, we act as though we perform the appropriate F IND-SET operations sepa- rately. The following lemma shows that even if we count the extra FIND-SET op- erations induced by UNION calls, the asymptotic running time remains unchanged. Lemma 19.7 Suppose that we convert a sequence S 0 of m 0 MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations into a sequence S of m MAKE-SET, LINK, and FIND-SET operations by turning each UNION into two FIND-SET operations followed by one LINK. Then, if sequence S runs in O.m ˛.n// time, sequence S 0 runs in O.m 0 ˛.n// time. Proof Since each UNION operation in sequence S 0 is converted into three oper- ations in S , we have m 0 හ m හ 3m 0 , so that m D ‚.m 0 /, Thus, an O.m ˛.n// 19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression 535 time bound for the converted sequence S implies an O.m 0 ˛.n// time bound for the original sequence S 0 . From now on, we assume that the initial sequence of m 0 MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations has been converted to a sequence of m MAKE-SET, LINK, and FIND-SET operations. We now prove an O.m ˛.n// time bound for the converted sequence and appeal to Lemma 19.7 to prove the O.m 0 ˛.n// running time of the original sequence of m 0 operations. Potential function The potential function we use assigns a potential � q .x/ to each node x in the disjoint-set forest after q operations. For the potential ˆ q of the entire forest after q operations, sum the individual node potentials: ˆ q D P x � q .x/. Because the forest is empty before the ûrst operation, the sum is taken over an empty set, and so ˆ 0 D 0. No potential ˆ q is ever negative. The value of � q .x/ depends on whether x is a tree root after the qth operation. If it is, or if x: rank D 0, then � q .x/ D ˛.n/  x: rank. Now suppose that after the qth operation, x is not a root and that x: rank  1. We need to deûne two auxiliary functions on x before we can deûne � q .x/. First we deûne level.x/ D max fk W x: p: rank  A k .x: rank/g : (19.3) That is, level.x/ is the greatest level k for which A k , applied to x ’s rank, is no greater than x ’s parent’s rank. We claim that 0 හ level.x/ < ˛.n/ ; (19.4) which we see as follows. We have x: p: rank  x: rank C 1 (by Lemma 19.4 because x is not a root) D A 0 .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (19.1) of A 0 .j /) , which implies that level.x/  0, and A ˛.n/ .x: rank/  A ˛.n/ .1/ (because A k .j / is strictly increasing)  n (by the deûnition (19.2) of ˛.n/) > x: p: rank (by Lemma 19.6) , which implies that level.x/ < ˛.n/. For a given nonroot node x , the value of level.x/ monotonically increases over time. Why? Because x is not a root, its rank does not change. The rank of x: p 536 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets monotonically increases over time, since if x: p is not a root then its rank does not change, and if x: p is a root then its rank can never decrease. Thus, the difference between x: rank and x: p: rank monotonically increases over time. Therefore, the value of k needed for A k .x: rank/ to overtake x: p: rank monotonically increases over time as well. The second auxiliary function applies when x: rank  1: iter.x/ D max ˚ i W x: p: rank  A .i / level.x/ .x: rank/  : (19.5) That is, iter.x/ is the largest number of times we can iteratively apply A level.x/ , applied initially to x ’s rank, before exceeding x ’s parent’s rank. We claim that when x: rank  1, we have 1 හ iter.x/ හ x: rank ; (19.6) which we see as follows. We have x: p: rank  A level.x/ .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (19.3) of level.x/) D A .1/ level.x/ .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (3.30) of functional iteration) , which implies that iter.x/  1. We also have A .x: rankC1/ level.x/ .x: rank/ D A level.x/C1 .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (19.1) of A k .j /) > x: p: rank (by the deûnition (19.3) of level.x/) , which implies that iter.x/ හ x: rank. Note that because x: p: rank monotonically increases over time, in order for iter.x/ to decrease, level.x/ must increase. As long as level.x/ remains unchanged, iter.x/ must either increase or remain unchanged. With these auxiliary functions in place, we are ready to deûne the potential of node x after q operations: � q .x/ D Ĩ ˛.n/  x: rank if x is a root or x: rank D 0 ; .˛.n/  level.x//  x: rank  iter.x/ if x is not a root and x: rank  1 : (19.7) We next investigate some useful properties of node potentials. Lemma 19.8 For every node x , and for all operation counts q, we have 0 හ � q .x/ හ ˛.n/  x: rank : Proof If x is a root or x: rank D 0, then � q .x/ D ˛.n/  x: rank by deûnition. Now suppose that x is not a root and that x: rank  1. We can obtain a lower bound on � q .x/ by maximizing level.x/ and iter.x/. The bounds (19.4) and (19.6) give ˛.n/  level.x/  1 and iter.x/ හ x: rank. Thus, we have 19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression 537 � q .x/ D .˛.n/  level.x//  x: rank  iter.x/  x: rank  x: rank D 0 : Similarly, minimizing level.x/ and iter.x/ provides an upper bound on � q .x/. By the bound (19.4), level.x/  0, and by the bound (19.6), iter.x/  1. Thus, we have q .x/ හ .˛.n/  0/  x: rank  1 D ˛.n/  x: rank  1 < ˛.n/  x: rank : Corollary 19.9 If node x is not a root and x: rank > 0, then � q .x/ < ˛.n/  x: rank. Potential changes and amortized costs of operations We are now ready to examine how the disjoint-set operations affect node poten- tials. Once we understand how each operation can change the potential, we can determine the amortized costs. Lemma 19.10 Let x be a node that is not a root, and suppose that the qth operation is either a LINK or a FIND-SET. Then after the qth operation, � q .x/ හ � q1 .x/. Moreover, if x: rank  1 and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes due to the qth operation, then � q .x/ හ � q1 .x/  1. That is, x ’s potential cannot increase, and if it has positive rank and either level.x/ or iter.x/ changes, then x ’s potential drops by at least 1. Proof Because x is not a root, the qth operation does not change x: rank, and because n does not change after the initial n MAKE-SET operations, ˛.n/ remains unchanged as well. Hence, these components of the formula for x ’s potential re- main the same after the qth operation. If x: rank D 0, then � q .x/ D � q1 .x/ D 0. Now assume that x: rank  1. Recall that level.x/ monotonically increases over time. If the qth operation leaves level.x/ unchanged, then iter.x/ either in- creases or remains unchanged. If both level.x/ and iter.x/ are unchanged, then � q .x/ D � q1 .x/. If level.x/ is unchanged and iter.x/ increases, then it increases by at least 1, and so � q .x/ හ � q1 .x/  1. Finally, if the qth operation increases level.x/, it increases by at least 1, so that the value of the term .˛.n/  level.x//  x: rank drops by at least x: rank. Be- cause level.x/ increased, the value of iter.x/ might drop, but according to the bound (19.6), the drop is by at most x: rank  1. Thus, the increase in poten- 538 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets tial due to the change in iter.x/ is less than the decrease in potential due to the change in level.x/, yielding � q .x/ හ � q1 .x/  1. Our ûnal three lemmas show that the amortized cost of each M AKE-SET, LINK, and FIND-SET operation is O.˛.n//. Recall from equation (16.2) on page 456 that the amortized cost of each operation is its actual cost plus the change in potential due to the operation. Lemma 19.11 The amortized cost of each MAKE-SET operation is O.1/. Proof Suppose that the qth operation is MAKE-SET .x/. This operation creates node x with rank 0, so that � q .x/ D 0. No other ranks or potentials change, and so ˆ q D ˆ q1 . Noting that the actual cost of the MAKE-SET operation is O.1/ completes the proof. Lemma 19.12 The amortized cost of each LINK operation is O.˛.n//. Proof Suppose that the qth operation is LINK.x; y/. The actual cost of the LINK operation is O.1/. Without loss of generality, suppose that the LINK makes y the parent of x . To determine the change in potential due to the LINK, note that the only nodes whose potentials may change are x , y , and the children of y just prior to the oper- ation. We’ll show that the only node whose potential can increase due to the LINK is y , and that its increase is at most ˛.n/:  By Lemma 19.10, any node that is y ’s child just before the LINK cannot have its potential increase due to the LINK.  From the deûnition (19.7) of � q .x/, note that, since x was a root just before the qth operation, � q1 .x/ D ˛.n/  x: rank at that time. If x: rank D 0, then � q .x/ D � q1 .x/ D 0. Otherwise, � q .x/ < ˛.n/  x: rank (by Corollary 19.9) D � q1 .x/ ; and so x ’s potential decreases.  Because y is a root prior to the LINK, � q1 .y/ D ˛.n/  y: rank. After the LINK operation, y remains a root, so that y ’s potential still equals ˛.n/ times its rank after the operation. The LINK operation either leaves y ’s rank alone or increases y ’s rank by 1. Therefore, either � q .y/ D � q1 .y/ or � q .y/ D � q1 .y/ C ˛.n/. 19.4 Analysis of union by rank with path compression 539 The increase in potential due to the LINK operation, therefore, is at most ˛.n/. The amortized cost of the LINK operation is O.1/ C ˛.n/ D O.˛.n//. Lemma 19.13 The amortized cost of each F IND-SET operation is O.˛.n//. Proof Suppose that the qth operation is a FIND-SET and that the ûnd path con- tains s nodes. The actual cost of the FIND-SET operation is O.s/. We will show that no node’s potential increases due to the F IND-SET and that at least max f0; s  .˛.n/ C 2/g nodes on the ûnd path have their potential decrease by at least 1. We ûrst show that no node’s potential increases. Lemma 19.10 takes care of all nodes other than the root. If x is the root, then its potential is ˛.n/  x: rank, which does not change due to the FIND-SET operation. Now we show that at least max f0; s  .˛.n/ C 2/g nodes have their potential decrease by at least 1. Let x be a node on the ûnd path such that x: rank > 0 and x is followed somewhere on the ûnd path by another node y that is not a root, where level.y/ D level.x/ just before the FIND-SET operation. (Node y need not immediately follow x on the ûnd path.) All but at most ˛.n/ C 2 nodes on the ûnd path satisfy these constraints on x . Those that do not satisfy them are the ûrst node on the ûnd path (if it has rank 0), the last node on the path (i.e., the root), and the last node w on the path for which level.w/ D k, for each k D 0; 1; 2; : : : ; ˛.n/  1. Consider such a node x . It has positive rank and is followed somewhere on the ûnd path by nonroot node y such that level.y/ D level.x/ before the path compression occurs. We claim that the path compression decreases x ’s potential by at least 1. To prove this claim, let k D level.x/ D level.y/ and i D iter.x/ before the path compression occurs. Just prior to the path compression caused by the FIND-SET, we have x: p: rank  A .i / k .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (19.5) of iter.x/) , y: p: rank  A k .y: rank/ (by the deûnition (19.3) of level.y/) , y: rank  x: p: rank (by Corollary 19.5 and because y follows x on the ûnd path) . Putting these inequalities together gives y: p: rank  A k .y: rank/  A k .x: p: rank/ (because A k .j / is strictly increasing)  A k .A .i / k .x: rank// D A .i C1/ k .x: rank/ (by the deûnition (3.30) of functional iteration) . 540 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets Because path compression makes x and y have the same parent, after path com- pression we have x: p: rank D y: p: rank. The parent of y might change due to the path compression, but if it does, the rank of y ’s new parent compared with the rank of y ’s parent before path compression is either the same or greater. Since x: rank does not change, x: p: rank D y: p: rank  A .i C1/ k .x: rank/ after path compression. By the deûnition (19.5) of the iter function, the value of iter.x/ increases from i to at least i C 1. By Lemma 19.10, � q .x/ හ � q1 .x/  1, so that x ’s potential decreases by at least 1. The amortized cost of the FIND-SET operation is the actual cost plus the change in potential. The actual cost is O.s/, and we have shown that the total potential decreases by at least max f0; s  .˛.n/ C 2/g. The amortized cost, therefore, is at most O.s/  .s  .˛.n/ C 2// D O.s/  s C O.˛.n// D O.˛.n//, since we can scale up the units of potential to dominate the constant hidden in O.s/. (See Exercise 19.4-6.) Putting the preceding lemmas together yields the following theorem. Theorem 19.14 A sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, can be performed on a disjoint-set forest with union by rank and path compression in O.m ˛.n// time. Proof Immediate from Lemmas 19.7, 19.11, 19.12, and 19.13. Exercises 19.4-1 Prove Lemma 19.4. 19.4-2 Prove that every node has rank at most blg nc. 19.4-3 In light of Exercise 19.4-2, how many bits are necessary to store x: rank for each node x ? 19.4-4 Using Exercise 19.4-2, give a simple proof that operations on a disjoint-set forest with union by rank but without path compression run in O.m lg n/ time. Problems for Chapter 19 541 19.4-5 Professor Dante reasons that because node ranks increase strictly along a simple path to the root, node levels must monotonically increase along the path. In other words, if x: rank > 0 and x: p is not a root, then level.x/ හ level.x: p/. Is the professor correct? 19.4-6 The proof of Lemma 19.13 ends with scaling the units of potential to dominate the constant hidden in the O.s/ term. To be more precise in the proof, you need to change the deûnition (19.7) of the potential function to multiply each of the two cases by a constant, say c , that dominates the constant in the O.s/ term. How must the rest of the analysis change to accommodate this updated potential function? ? 19.4-7 Consider the function ˛ 0 .n/ D min fk W A k .1/  lg.n C 1/g. Show that ˛ 0 .n/ හ 3 for all practical values of n and, using Exercise 19.4-2, show how to modify the potential-function argument to prove that performing a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, on a disjoint-set forest with union by rank and path compression takes O.m˛ 0 .n// time. Problems 19-1 Ofüine minimum In the ofüine minimum problem, you maintain a dynamic set T of elements from the domain f1; 2; : : : ; ng under the operations I NSERT and EXTRACT-MIN. The input is a sequence S of n I NSERT and m EXTRACT-MIN calls, where each key in f1; 2; : : : ; ng is inserted exactly once. Your goal is to determine which key is returned by each EXTRACT-MIN call. Speciûcally, you must ûll in an array extracted Œ1 W m�, where for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, extracted Œi � is the key returned by the i th EXTRACT-MIN call. The problem is <ofüine= in the sense that you are allowed to process the entire sequence S before determining any of the returned keys. a. Consider the following instance of the ofüine minimum problem, in which each operation I NSERT .i / is represented by the value of i and each EXTRACT-MIN is represented by the letter E: 4; 8; E; 3; E; 9; 2; 6; E; E; E; 1; 7; E; 5 : Fill in the correct values in the extracted array. 542 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets To develop an algorithm for this problem, break the sequence S into homogeneous subsequences. That is, represent S by I 1 ; E; I 2 ; E; I 3 ; : : : ; I m ; E; I mC1 ; where each E represents a single EXTRACT-MIN call and each I j represents a (pos- sibly empty) sequence of I NSERT calls. For each subsequence I j , initially place the keys inserted by these operations into a set K j , which is empty if I j is empty. Then execute the OFFLINE-MINIMUM procedure. OFFLINE-MINIMUM.m; n/ 1 for i D 1 to n 2 determine j such that i 2 K j 3 if j ¤ m C 1 4 extracted Œj � D i 5 let l be the smallest value greater than j for which set K l exists 6 K l D K j [ K l , destroying K j 7 return extracted b. Argue that the array extracted returned by OFFLINE-MINIMUM is correct. c. Describe how to implement OFFLINE-MINIMUM efûciently with a disjoint-set data structure. Give as tight a bound as you can on the worst-case running time of your implementation. 19-2 Depth determination In the depth-determination problem, you maintain a forest F D fT i g of rooted trees under three operations: MAKE-TREE .v/ creates a tree whose only node is v. FIND-DEPTH .v/ returns the depth of node v within its tree. GRAFT.r; v/ makes node r , which is assumed to be the root of a tree, become the child of node v, which is assumed to be in a different tree from r but may or may not itself be a root. a. Suppose that you use a tree representation similar to a disjoint-set forest: v: p is the parent of node v, except that v: p D v if v is a root. Suppose further that you implement GRAFT.r; v/ by setting r: p D v and FIND-DEPTH .v/ by following the ûnd path from v up to the root, returning a count of all nodes other than v encountered. Show that the worst-case running time of a sequence of m MAKE-TREE, FIND-DEPTH, and GRAFT operations is ‚.m 2 /. Problems for Chapter 19 543 By using the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics, you can reduce the worst-case running time. Use the disjoint-set forest S D fS i g, where each set S i (which is itself a tree) corresponds to a tree T i in the forest F . The tree structure within a set S i , however, does not necessarily correspond to that of T i . In fact, the implementation of S i does not record the exact parent-child relationships but nevertheless allows you to determine any node’s depth in T i . The key idea is to maintain in each node v a <pseudodistance= v: d, which is deûned so that the sum of the pseudodistances along the simple path from v to the root of its set S i equals the depth of v in T i . That is, if the simple path from v to its root in S i is v 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k , where v 0 D v and v k is S i ’s root, then the depth of v in T i is P k j D0 v j : d. b. Give an implementation of MAKE-TREE. c. Show how to modify FIND-SET to implement FIND-DEPTH. Your implemen- tation should perform path compression, and its running time should be linear in the length of the ûnd path. Make sure that your implementation updates pseudodistances correctly. d. Show how to implement GRAFT.r; v/, which combines the sets containing r and v, by modifying the UNION and LINK procedures. Make sure that your implementation updates pseudodistances correctly. Note that the root of a set S i is not necessarily the root of the corresponding tree T i . e. Give a tight bound on the worst-case running time of a sequence of m MAKE- TREE, FIND-DEPTH, and GRAFT operations, n of which are MAKE-TREE op- erations. 19-3 Tarjan’s ofüine lowest-common-ancestors algorithm The lowest common ancestor of two nodes u and v in a rooted tree T is the node w that is an ancestor of both u and v and that has the greatest depth in T . In the ofüine lowest-common-ancestors problem, you are given a rooted tree T and an arbitrary set P D ffu; vgg of unordered pairs of nodes in T , and you wish to determine the lowest common ancestor of each pair in P . To solve the ofüine lowest-common-ancestors problem, the LCA procedure on the following page performs a tree walk of T with the initial call LCA.T: root /. Assume that each node is colored WHITE prior to the walk. a. Argue that line 10 executes exactly once for each pair fu; vg 2 P . b. Argue that at the time of the call LCA.u/, the number of sets in the disjoint-set data structure equals the depth of u in T . 544 Chapter 19 Data Structures for Disjoint Sets LCA.u/ 1 MAKE-SET .u/ 2 FIND-SET.u/: ancestor D u 3 for each child v of u in T 4 LCA.v/ 5 UNION.u; v/ 6 FIND-SET.u/: ancestor D u 7 u: color D BLAC K 8 for each node v such that fu; vg 2 P 9 if v: color == BLAC K 10 print <The lowest common ancestor of= u <and= v <is= FIND-SET .v/: ancestor c. Prove that LCA correctly prints the lowest common ancestor of u and v for each pair fu; vg 2 P . d. Analyze the running time of LCA, assuming that you use the implementation of the disjoint-set data structure in Section 19.3. Chapter notes Many of the important results for disjoint-set data structures are due at least in part to R. E. Tarjan. Using aggregate analysis, Tarjan [427, 429] gave the ûrst tight upper bound in terms of the very slowly growing inverse y ˛.m; n/ of Ackermann’s function. (The function A k .j / given in Section 19.4 is similar to Ackermann’s function, and the function ˛.n/ is similar to y ˛.m; n/. Both ˛.n/ and y ˛.m; n/ are at most 4 for all conceivable values of m and n.) An upper bound of O.m lg  n/ was proven earlier by Hopcroft and Ullman [5, 227]. The treatment in Section 19.4 is adapted from a later analysis by Tarjan [431], which is based on an analysis by Kozen [270]. Harfst and Reingold [209] give a potential-based version of Tarjan’s earlier bound. Tarjan and van Leeuwen [432] discuss variants on the path-compression heuris- tic, including <one-pass methods,= which sometimes offer better constant factors in their performance than do two-pass methods. As with Tarjan’s earlier analyses of the basic path-compression heuristic, the analyses by Tarjan and van Leeuwen are aggregate. Harfst and Reingold [209] later showed how to make a small change to the potential function to adapt their path-compression analysis to these one-pass variants. Goel et al. [182] prove that linking disjoint-set trees randomly yields the Notes for Chapter 19 545 same asymptotic running time as union by rank. Gabow and Tarjan [166] show that in certain applications, the disjoint-set operations can be made to run in O.m/ time. Tarjan [428] showed that a lower bound of �.m y ˛.m; n// time is required for operations on any disjoint-set data structure satisfying certain technical conditions. This lower bound was later generalized by Fredman and Saks [155], who showed that in the worst case, �.m y ˛.m; n// .lg n/-bit words of memory must be accessed. Part VI Graph Algorithms Introduction Graph problems pervade computer science, and algorithms for working with them are fundamental to the ûeld. Hundreds of interesting computational problems are couched in terms of graphs. This part touches on a few of the more signiûcant ones. Chapter 20 shows how to represent a graph in a computer and then discusses algorithms based on searching a graph using either breadth-ûrst search or depth- ûrst search. The chapter gives two applications of depth-ûrst search: topologically sorting a directed acyclic graph and decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components. Chapter 21 describes how to compute a minimum-weight spanning tree of a graph: the least-weight way of connecting all of the vertices together when each edge has an associated weight. The algorithms for computing minimum spanning trees serve as good examples of greedy algorithms (see Chapter 15). Chapters 22 and 23 consider how to compute shortest paths between vertices when each edge has an associated length or <weight.= Chapter 22 shows how to ûnd shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices, and Chapter 23 examines methods to compute shortest paths between every pair of vertices. Chapter 24 shows how to compute a maximum üow of material in a üow net- work, which is a directed graph having a speciûed source vertex of material, a speciûed sink vertex, and speciûed capacities for the amount of material that can traverse each directed edge. This general problem arises in many forms, and a good algorithm for computing maximum üows can help solve a variety of related problems efûciently. Finally, Chapter 25 explores matchings in bipartite graphs: methods for pairing up vertices that are partitioned into two sets by selecting edges that go between the sets. Bipartite-matching problems model several situations that arise in the real world. The chapter examines how to ûnd a matching of maximum cardinality; the 548 Part VI Graph Algorithms <stable-marriage problem,= which has the highly practical application of matching medical residents to hospitals; and assignment problems, which maximize the total weight of a bipartite matching. When we characterize the running time of a graph algorithm on a given graph G D .V; E/, we usually measure the size of the input in terms of the number of vertices jV j and the number of edges jEj of the graph. That is, we denote the size of the input with two parameters, not just one. We adopt a common notational convention for these parameters. Inside asymptotic notation (such as O-notation or ‚-notation), and only inside such notation, the symbol V denotes jV j and the symbol E denotes jEj. For example, we might say, <the algorithm runs in O.VE/ time,= meaning that the algorithm runs in O.jV j jEj/ time. This convention makes the running-time formulas easier to read, without risk of ambiguity. Another convention we adopt appears in pseudocode. We denote the vertex set of a graph G by G: V and its edge set by G: E. That is, the pseudocode views vertex and edge sets as attributes of a graph. 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms This chapter presents methods for representing a graph and for searching a graph. Searching a graph means systematically following the edges of the graph so as to visit the vertices of the graph. A graph-searching algorithm can discover much about the structure of a graph. Many algorithms begin by searching their input graph to obtain this structural information. Several other graph algorithms elabo- rate on basic graph searching. Techniques for searching a graph lie at the heart of the ûeld of graph algorithms. Section 20.1 discusses the two most common computational representations of graphs: as adjacency lists and as adjacency matrices. Section 20.2 presents a sim- ple graph-searching algorithm called breadth-ûrst search and shows how to cre- ate a breadth-ûrst tree. Section 20.3 presents depth-ûrst search and proves some standard results about the order in which depth-ûrst search visits vertices. Sec- tion 20.4 provides our ûrst real application of depth-ûrst search: topologically sort- ing a directed acyclic graph. A second application of depth-ûrst search, ûnding the strongly connected components of a directed graph, is the topic of Section 20.5. 20.1 Representations of graphs You can choose between two standard ways to represent a graph G D .V; E/: as a collection of adjacency lists or as an adjacency matrix. Either way applies to both directed and undirected graphs. Because the adjacency-list representation provides a compact way to represent sparse graphs4those for which jEj is much less than jV j 2 4it is usually the method of choice. Most of the graph algorithms presented in this book assume that an input graph is represented in adjacency-list form. You might prefer an adjacency-matrix representation, however, when the graph is dense4jEj is close to jV j 2 4or when you need to be able to tell quickly whether there is an edge connecting two given vertices. For example, two of the 550 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 4 5 2 5 1 2 2 4 1 2 5 3 4 4 5 3 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 4 5 (a) (b) (c) Figure 20.1 Two representations of an undirected graph.

(c) The adjacency-matrix representation of G. all-pairs shortest-paths algorithms presented in Chapter 23 assume that their input graphs are represented by adjacency matrices. The adjacency-list representation of a graph G D .V; E/ consists of an ar- ray Adj of jV j lists, one for each vertex in V . For each u 2 V , the adjacency list AdjŒu� contains all the vertices v such that there is an edge .u; v/ 2 E. That is, AdjŒu� consists of all the vertices adjacent to u in G. (Alternatively, it can con- tain pointers to these vertices.) Since the adjacency lists represent the edges of a graph, our pseudocode treats the array Adj as an attribute of the graph, just like the edge set E. In pseudocode, therefore, you will see notation such as G: AdjŒu�. Figure 20.1(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the undirected graph in Fig- ure 20.1(a). Similarly, Figure 20.2(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the directed graph in Figure 20.2(a). If G is a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is jEj, since an edge of the form .u; v/ is represented by having v appear in AdjŒu�. If G is 20.1 Representations of graphs 551 an undirected graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is 2 jEj, since if .u; v/ is an undirected edge, then u appears in v’s adjacency list and vice versa. For both directed and undirected graphs, the adjacency-list representation has the desirable property that the amount of memory it requires is ‚.V C E/. Finding each edge in the graph also takes ‚.V C E/ time, rather than just ‚.E/, since each of the jV j adjacency lists must be examined. Of course, if jEj D �.V / 4such as in a connected, undirected graph or a strongly connected, directed graph4we can say that ûnding each edge takes ‚.E/ time. Adjacency lists can also represent weighted graphs, that is, graphs for which each edge has an associated weight given by a weight function w W E ! R. For example, let G D .V; E/ be a weighted graph with weight function w. Then you can simply store the weight w.u; v/ of the edge .u; v/ 2 E with vertex v in u’s adjacency list. The adjacency-list representation is quite robust in that you can modify it to support many other graph variants. A potential disadvantage of the adjacency-list representation is that it provides no quicker way to determine whether a given edge .u; v/ is present in the graph than to search for v in the adjacency list AdjŒu�. An adjacency-matrix representa- tion of the graph remedies this disadvantage, but at the cost of using asymptotically more memory. (See Exercise 20.1-8 for suggestions of variations on adjacency lists that permit faster edge lookup.) The adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G D .V; E/ assumes that the vertices are numbered 1; 2; : : : ; jV j in some arbitrary manner. Then the adjacency- matrix representation of a graph G consists of a jV j  jV j matrix A D .a ij / such that ij D ( 1 if .i; j / 2 E ; 0 otherwise : Figures 20.1(c) and 20.2(c) are the adjacency matrices of the undirected and di- rected graphs in Figures 20.1(a) and 20.2(a), respectively . The adjacency matrix of a graph requires ‚.V 2 / memory, independent of the number of edges in the graph. Because ûnding each edge in the graph requires examining the entire adjacency matrix, doing so takes ‚.V 2 / time. Observe the symmetry along the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix in Fig- ure 20.1(c). Since in an undirected graph, .u; v/ and .v; u/ represent the same edge, the adjacency matrix A of an undirected graph is its own transpose: A D A T . In some applications, it pays to store only the entries on and above the diagonal of the adjacency matrix, thereby cutting the memory needed to store the graph almost in half. Like the adjacency-list representation of a graph, an adjacency matrix can rep- resent a weighted graph. For example, if G D .V; E/ is a weighted graph with edge-weight function w, you can store the weight w.u; v/ of the edge .u; v/ 2 E 552 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms as the entry in row u and column v of the adjacency matrix. If an edge does not exist, you can store a NIL value as its corresponding matrix entry, though for many problems it is convenient to use a value such as 0 or 1. Although the adjacency-list representation is asymptotically at least as space- efûcient as the adjacency-matrix representation, adjacency matrices are simpler, and so you might prefer them when graphs are reasonably small. Moreover, adja- cency matrices carry a further advantage for unweighted graphs: they require only one bit per entry. Representing attributes Most algorithms that operate on graphs need to maintain attributes for vertices and/or edges. We indicate these attributes using our usual notation, such as v: d for an attribute d of a vertex v. When we indicate edges as pairs of vertices, we use the same style of notation. For example, if edges have an attribute f , then we denote this attribute for edge .u; v/ by .u; v/: f . For the purpose of presenting and understanding algorithms, our attribute notation sufûces. Implementing vertex and edge attributes in real programs can be another story entirely. There is no one best way to store and access vertex and edge attributes. For a given situation, your decision will likely depend on the programming lan- guage you are using, the algorithm you are implementing, and how the rest of your program uses the graph. If you represent a graph using adjacency lists, one design choice is to represent vertex attributes in additional arrays, such as an array d Œ1 W jV j� that parallels the Adj array. If the vertices adjacent to u belong to AdjŒu�, then the attribute u: d can actually be stored in the array entry d Œu�. Many other ways of implementing attributes are possible. For example, in an object- oriented programming language, vertex attributes might be represented as instance variables within a subclass of a Vertex class. Exercises 20.1-1 Given an adjacency-list representation of a directed graph, how long does it take to compute the out-degree of every vertex? How long does it take to compute the in-degrees? 20.1-2 Give an adjacency-list representation for a complete binary tree on 7 vertices. Give an equivalent adjacency-matrix representation. Assume that the edges are undi- rected and that the vertices are numbered from 1 to 7 as in a binary heap. 20.1 Representations of graphs 553 20.1-3 The transpose of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is the graph G T D .V; E T /, where E T D f.v; u/ 2 V  V W .u; v/ 2 Eg. That is, G T is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efûcient algorithms for computing G T from G, for both the adjacency- list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms. 20.1-4 Given an adjacency-list representation of a multigraph G D .V; E/, describe an O.V C E/-time algorithm to compute the adjacency-list representation of the <equivalent= undirected graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where E 0 consists of the edges in E with all multiple edges between two vertices replaced by a single edge and with all self-loops removed. 20.1-5 The square of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is the graph G 2 D .V; E 2 / such that .u; v/ 2 E 2 if and only if G contains a path with at most two edges between u and v. Describe efûcient algorithms for computing G 2 from G for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms. 20.1-6 Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as input re- quire �.V 2 / time, but there are some exceptions. Show how to determine whether a directed graph G contains a universal sink4a vertex with in-degree jV j  1 and out-degree 04in O.V / time, given an adjacency matrix for G. 20.1-7 The incidence matrix of a directed graph G D .V; E/ with no self-loops is a jV j  jEj matrix B D .b ij / such that b ij D Ĩ 1 if edge j leaves vertex i ; 1 if edge j enters vertex i ; 0 otherwise : Describe what the entries of the matrix product BB T represent, where B T is the transpose of B . 20.1-8 Suppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry AdjŒu� is a hash table contain- ing the vertices v for which .u; v/ 2 E, with collisions resolved by chaining. Un- der the assumption of uniform independent hashing, if all edge lookups are equally likely, what is the expected time to determine whether an edge is in the graph? 554 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms What disadvantages does this scheme have? Suggest an alternate data structure for each edge list that solves these problems. Does your alternative have disadvantages compared with the hash table? 20.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search Breadth-ûrst search is one of the simplest algorithms for searching a graph and the archetype for many important graph algorithms. Prim’s minimum-spanning- tree algorithm (Section 21.2) and Dijkstra’s single-source shortest-paths algorithm (Section 22.3) use ideas similar to those in breadth-ûrst search. Given a graph G D .V; E/ and a distinguished source vertex s , breadth-ûrst search systematically explores the edges of G to <discover= every vertex that is reachable from s . It computes the distance from s to each reachable vertex, where the distance to a vertex v equals the smallest number of edges needed to go from s to v. Breadth-ûrst search also produces a <breadth-ûrst tree= with root s that con- tains all reachable vertices. For any vertex v reachable from s , the simple path in the breadth-ûrst tree from s to v corresponds to a shortest path from s to v in G, that is, a path containing the smallest number of edges. The algorithm works on both directed and undirected graphs. Breadth-ûrst search is so named because it expands the frontier between discov- ered and undiscovered vertices uniformly across the breadth of the frontier. You can think of it as discovering vertices in waves emanating from the source vertex. That is, starting from s , the algorithm ûrst discovers all neighbors of s , which have distance 1. Then it discovers all vertices with distance 2, then all vertices with distance 3, and so on, until it has discovered every vertex reachable from s . In order to keep track of the waves of vertices, breadth-ûrst search could main- tain separate arrays or lists of the vertices at each distance from the source vertex. Instead, it uses a single ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue (see Section 10.1.3) containing some vertices at a distance k, possibly followed by some vertices at distance k C 1. The queue, therefore, contains portions of two consecutive waves at any time. To keep track of progress, breadth-ûrst search colors each vertex white, gray, or black. All vertices start out white, and vertices not reachable from the source vertex s stay white the entire time. A vertex that is reachable from s is discovered the ûrst time it is encountered during the search, at which time it becomes gray, in- dicating that is now on the frontier of the search: the boundary between discovered and undiscovered vertices. The queue contains all the gray vertices. Eventually, all the edges of a gray vertex will be explored, so that all of its neighbors will be 20.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search 555 discovered. Once all of a vertex’s edges have been explored, the vertex is behind the frontier of the search, and it goes from gray to black. 1 Breadth-ûrst search constructs a breadth-ûrst tree, initially containing only its root, which is the source vertex s . Whenever the search discovers a white vertex v in the course of scanning the adjacency list of a gray vertex u, the vertex v and the edge .u; v/ are added to the tree. We say that u is the predecessor or parent of v in the breadth-ûrst tree. Since every vertex reachable from s is discovered at most once, each vertex reachable from s has exactly one parent. (There is one exception: because s is the root of the breadth-ûrst tree, it has no parent.) Ancestor and descendant relationships in the breadth-ûrst tree are deûned relative to the root s as usual: if u is on the simple path in the tree from the root s to vertex v, then u is an ancestor of v and v is a descendant of u. The breadth-ûrst-search procedure BFS on the following page assumes that the graph G D .V; E/ is represented using adjacency lists. It denotes the queue by Q, and it attaches three additional attributes to each vertex v in the graph:  v: color is the color of v: WHITE, GRAY, or BLAC K.  v: d holds the distance from the source vertex s to v, as computed by the algo- rithm.  v:� is v’s predecessor in the breadth-ûrst tree. If v has no predecessor because it is the source vertex or is undiscovered, then v:� D NIL. Figure 20.3 illustrates the progress of BFS on an undirected graph. The procedure BFS works as follows. With the exception of the source vertex s , lines 134 paint every vertex white, set u: d D 1 for each vertex u, and set the parent of every vertex to be NIL. Because the source vertex s is always the ûrst vertex discovered, lines 537 paint s gray, set s: d to 0, and set the predecessor of s to NIL. Lines 839 create the queue Q, initially containing just the source vertex. The while loop of lines 10318 iterates as long as there remain gray vertices, which are on the frontier: discovered vertices that have not yet had their adjacency lists fully examined. This while loop maintains the following invariant: At the test in line 10, the queue Q consists of the set of gray vertices. Although we won’t use this loop invariant to prove correctness, it is easy to see that it holds prior to the ûrst iteration and that each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant. Prior to the ûrst iteration, the only gray vertex, and the only vertex 1 We distinguish between gray and black vertices to help us understand how breadth-ûrst search operates. In fact, as Exercise 20.2-3 shows, we get the same result even if we do not distinguish between gray and black vertices. 556 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms BFS.G; s/ 1 for each vertex u 2 G: V  fs g 2 u: color D WHITE 3 u: d D 1 4 u:� D NIL 5 s: color D GRAY 6 s: d D 0 7 s:� D NIL 8 Q D ; 9 ENQUEUE.Q; s/ 10 while Q ¤ ; 11 u D DEQUEUE.Q/ 12 for each vertex v in G: AdjŒu� // search the neighbors of u 13 if v: color == WHITE // is v being discovered now? 14 v: color D GRAY 15 v: d D u: d C 1 16 v:� D u 17 ENQUEUE.Q; v/ // v is now on the frontier 18 u: color D BLAC K // u is now behind the frontier in Q, is the source vertex s . Line 11 determines the gray vertex u at the head of the queue Q and removes it from Q. The for loop of lines 12317 considers each vertex v in the adjacency list of u. If v is white, then it has not yet been discovered, and the procedure discovers it by executing lines 14317. These lines paint vertex v gray, set v’s distance v: d to u: d C 1, record u as v’s parent v:� , and place v at the tail of the queue Q. Once the procedure has examined all the vertices on u’s adjacency list, it blackens u in line 18, indicating that u is now behind the frontier. The loop invariant is maintained because whenever a vertex is painted gray (in line 14) it is also enqueued (in line 17), and whenever a vertex is dequeued (in line 11) it is also painted black (in line 18). The results of breadth-ûrst search may depend upon the order in which the neigh- bors of a given vertex are visited in line 12: the breadth-ûrst tree may vary, but the distances d computed by the algorithm do not. (See Exercise 20.2-5.) A simple change allows the BFS procedure to terminate in many cases before the queue Q becomes empty. Because each vertex is discovered at most once and receives a ûnite d value only when it is discovered, the algorithm can terminate once every vertex has a ûnite d value. If BFS keeps count of how many vertices have been discovered, it can terminate once either the queue Q is empty or all jV j vertices are discovered. 20.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search 557 r s t u w x y 0 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ s 0 Q (a) z ∞ r s t u w x y 1 ∞ 1 ∞ ∞ ∞ 1 r Q (b) z ∞ u 1 1 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 ∞ ∞ 2 1 Q (c) z ∞ u 1 1 t 2 w 2 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 ∞ 2 1 Q (d) z ∞ 1 t 2 w 2 y 2 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 ∞ 2 1 Q (e) z ∞ t 2 w 2 y 2 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 ∞ 2 1 Q (f) z ∞ w 2 y 2 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 Q (g) z 3 y 2 x 3 z 3 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 Q (h) z 3 x 3 z 3 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 Q (i) z 3 z 3 r s t u w x y 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 Q (j) z 3 0 ; v v v v v v v v v v v v v Figure 20.3 The operation of BFS on an undirected graph.

Blue edges belong to the breadth-ûrst tree constructed so far. 558 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms Analysis Before proving the various properties of breadth-ûrst search, let’s take on the easier job of analyzing its running time on an input graph G D .V; E/. We use aggregate analysis, as we saw in Section 16.1. After initialization, breadth-ûrst search never whitens a vertex, and thus the test in line 13 ensures that each vertex is enqueued at most once, and hence dequeued at most once. The operations of enqueuing and dequeuing take O.1/ time, and so the total time devoted to queue operations is O.V /. Because the procedure scans the adjacency list of each vertex only when the vertex is dequeued, it scans each adjacency list at most once. Since the sum of the lengths of all jV j adjacency lists is ‚.E/, the total time spent in scanning adjacency lists is O.V C E/. The overhead for initialization is O.V /, and thus the total running time of the BFS procedure is O.V C E/. Thus, breadth-ûrst search runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency-list representation of G. Shortest paths Now, let’s see why breadth-ûrst search ûnds the shortest distance from a given source vertex s to each vertex in a graph. Deûne the shortest-path distance ı.s; v/ from s to v as the minimum number of edges in any path from vertex s to vertex v. If there is no path from s to v, then ı.s; v/ D 1. We call a path of length ı.s; v/ from s to v a shortest path 2 from s to v. Before showing that breadth-ûrst search correctly computes shortest-path distances, we investigate an important property of shortest-path distances. Lemma 20.1 Let G D .V; E/ be a directed or undirected graph, and let s 2 V be an arbitrary vertex. Then, for any edge .u; v/ 2 E, ı.s; v/ හ ı.s; u/ C 1 : Proof If u is reachable from s , then so is v. In this case, the shortest path from s to v cannot be longer than the shortest path from s to u followed by the edge .u; v/, and thus the inequality holds. If u is not reachable from s , then ı.s; u/ D 1, and again, the inequality holds. Our goal is to show that the BFS procedure properly computes v: d D ı.s; v/ for each vertex v 2 V . We ûrst show that v: d bounds ı.s; v/ from above. 2 Chapters 22 and 23 generalize shortest paths to weighted graphs, in which every edge has a real- valued weight and the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. The graphs considered in the present chapter are unweighted or, equivalently, all edges have unit weight. 20.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search 559 Lemma 20.2 Let G D .V; E/ be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that BFS is run on G from a given source vertex s 2 V . Then, for each vertex v 2 V , the value v: d computed by BFS satisûes v: d  ı.s; v/ at all times, including at termination. Proof The lemma is true intuitively, because any ûnite value assigned to v: d equals the number of edges on some path from s to v. The formal proof is by induction on the number of E NQUEUE operations. The inductive hypothesis is that v: d  ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V . The base case of the induction is the situation immediately after enqueuing s in line 9 of BFS. The inductive hypothesis holds here, because s: d D 0 D ı.s; s/ and v: d D 1  ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V  fs g. For the inductive step, consider a white vertex v that is discovered during the search from a vertex u. The inductive hypothesis implies that u: d  ı.s; u/. The assignment performed by line 15 and Lemma 20.1 give v: d D u: d C 1  ı.s; u/ C 1  ı.s; v/ : Vertex v is then enqueued, and it is never enqueued again because it is also grayed and lines 14317 execute only for white vertices. Thus, the value of v: d never changes again, and the inductive hypothesis is maintained. To prove that v: d D ı.s; v/, we ûrst show more precisely how the queue Q operates during the course of BFS. The next lemma shows that at all times, the d values of vertices in the queue either are all the same or form a sequence hk; k; : : : ; k; k C 1; k C 1; : : : ; k C 1i for some integer k  0. Lemma 20.3 Suppose that during the execution of BFS on a graph G D .V; E/, the queue Q contains the vertices hv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v r i, where v 1 is the head of Q and v r is the tail. Then, v r : d හ v 1 : d C 1 and v i : d හ v i C1 : d for i D 1; 2; : : : ; r  1. Proof The proof is by induction on the number of queue operations. Initially, when the queue contains only s , the lemma trivially holds. For the inductive step, we must prove that the lemma holds after both dequeuing and enqueuing a vertex. First, we examine dequeuing. When the head v 1 of the queue is dequeued, v 2 becomes the new head. (If the queue becomes empty, then the lemma holds vacuously.) By the inductive hypothesis, v 1 : d හ v 2 : d. But then we have v r : d හ v 1 : d C1 හ v 2 : d C1, and the remaining inequalities are unaffected. Thus, the lemma follows with v 2 as the new head. 560 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms Now, we examine enqueuing. When line 17 of BFS enqueues a vertex v onto a queue containing vertices hv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v r i, the enqueued vertex becomes v r C1 . If the queue was empty before v was enqueued, then after enqueuing v, we have r D 1 and the lemma trivially holds. Now suppose that the queue was nonempty when v was enqueued. At that time, the procedure has most recently removed vertex u, whose adjacency list is currently being scanned, from the queue Q. Just before u was removed, we had u D v 1 and the inductive hypothesis held, so that u: d හ v 2 : d and v r : d හ u: d C 1. After u is removed from the queue, the vertex that had been v 2 becomes the new head v 1 of the queue, so that now u: d හ v 1 : d. Thus, v r C1 : d D v: d D u: d C 1 හ v 1 : d C 1. Since v r : d හ u: d C 1, we have v r : d හ u: d C 1 D v: d D v r C1 : d, and the remaining inequalities are unaffected. Thus, the lemma follows when v is enqueued. The following corollary shows that the d values at the time that vertices are enqueued monotonically increase over time. Corollary 20.4 Suppose that vertices v i and v j are enqueued during the execution of BFS, and that v i is enqueued before v j . Then v i : d හ v j : d at the time that v j is enqueued. Proof Immediate from Lemma 20.3 and the property that each vertex receives a ûnite d value at most once during the course of BFS. We can now prove that breadth-ûrst search correctly ûnds shortest-path dis- tances. Theorem 20.5 (Correctness of breadth-ûrst search) Let G D .V; E/ be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that BFS is run on G from a given source vertex s 2 V . Then, during its execution, BFS discovers every vertex v 2 V that is reachable from the source s , and upon termination, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V . Moreover, for any vertex v ¤ s that is reachable from s , one of the shortest paths from s to v is a shortest path from s to v:� followed by the edge .v:�; v/. Proof Assume for the purpose of contradiction that some vertex receives a d value not equal to its shortest-path distance. Of all such vertices, let v be a vertex that has the minimum ı.s; v/. By Lemma 20.2, we have v: d  ı.s; v/, and thus v: d > ı.s; v/. We cannot have v D s , because s: d D 0 and ı.s; s/ D 0. Vertex v must be reachable from s , for otherwise we would have ı.s; v/ D 1  v: d. Let u be the vertex immediately preceding v on some shortest path from s to v (since v ¤ s , vertex u must exist), so that ı.s; v/ D ı.s; u/C1. Because ı.s; u/ < ı.s; v/, 20.2 Breadth-ﬁrst search 561 and because of how we chose v, we have u: d D ı.s; u/. Putting these properties together gives v: d > ı.s; v/ D ı.s; u/ C 1 D u: d C 1 : (20.1) Now consider the time when BFS chooses to dequeue vertex u from Q in line 11. At this time, vertex v is either white, gray, or black. We shall show that each of these cases leads to a contradiction of inequality (20.1). If v is white, then line 15 sets v: d D u: d C 1, contradicting inequality (20.1). If v is black, then it was already removed from the queue and, by Corollary 20.4, we have v: d හ u: d, again contradicting inequality (20.1). If v is gray, then it was painted gray upon dequeuing some vertex w, which was removed from Q earlier than u and for which v: d D w: d C 1. By Corollary 20.4, however, w: d හ u: d, and so v: d D w: d C 1 හ u: d C 1, once again contradicting inequality (20.1). Thus we conclude that v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V . All vertices v reachable from s must be discovered, for otherwise they would have 1 D v: d > ı.s; v/. To conclude the proof of the theorem, observe from lines 15316 that if v:� D u, then v: d D u: d C 1. Thus, to form a shortest path from s to v, take a shortest path from s to v:� and then traverse the edge .v:�; v/. Breadth-ﬁrst trees The blue edges in Figure 20.3 show the breadth-ûrst tree built by the BFS pro- cedure as it searches the graph. The tree corresponds to the � attributes. More formally, for a graph G D .V; E/ with source s , we deûne the predecessor sub- graph of G as G  D .V  ; E  /, where V  D fv 2 V W v:� ¤ NILg [ fs g (20.2) and  D f.v:�; v/ W v 2 V   fs gg : (20.3) The predecessor subgraph G  is a breadth-ûrst tree if V  consists of the vertices reachable from s and, for all v 2 V  , the subgraph G  contains a unique simple path from s to v that is also a shortest path from s to v in G. A breadth-ûrst tree is in fact a tree, since it is connected and jE  j D jV  j  1 (see Theorem B.2 on page 1169). We call the edges in E  tree edges. The following lemma shows that the predecessor subgraph produced by the BFS procedure is a breadth-ûrst tree. Lemma 20.6 When applied to a directed or undirected graph G D .V; E/, procedure BFS con- structs � so that the predecessor subgraph G  D .V  ; E  / is a breadth-ûrst tree. 562 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms Proof Line 16 of BFS sets v:� D u if and only if .u; v/ 2 E and ı.s; v/ < 14 that is, if v is reachable from s 4and thus V  consists of the vertices in V reach- able from s . Since the predecessor subgraph G  forms a tree, by Theorem B.2, it contains a unique simple path from s to each vertex in V  . Applying Theorem 20.5 inductively yields that every such path is a shortest path in G. The PRINT-PATH procedure prints out the vertices on a shortest path from s to v, assuming that BFS has already computed a breadth-ûrst tree. This procedure runs in time linear in the number of vertices in the path printed, since each recursive call is for a path one vertex shorter. PRINT-PATH.G; s; v/ 1 if v == s 2 print s 3 elseif v:� == NIL 4 print <no path from= s <to= v <exists= 5 else PRINT-PATH.G; s; v:�/ 6 print v Exercises 20.2-1 Show the d and � values that result from running breadth-ûrst search on the di- rected graph of Figure 20.2(a), using vertex 3 as the source. 20.2-2 Show the d and � values that result from running breadth-ûrst search on the undi- rected graph of Figure 20.3, using vertex u as the source. Assume that neighbors of a vertex are visited in alphabetical order. 20.2-3 Show that using a single bit to store each vertex color sufûces by arguing that the BFS procedure produces the same result if line 18 is removed. Then show how to obviate the need for vertex colors altogether. 20.2-4 What is the running time of BFS if we represent its input graph by an adjacency matrix and modify the algorithm to handle this form of input? 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search 563 20.2-5 Argue that in a breadth-ûrst search, the value u: d assigned to a vertex u is inde- pendent of the order in which the vertices appear in each adjacency list. Using Figure 20.3 as an example, show that the breadth-ûrst tree computed by BFS can depend on the ordering within adjacency lists. 20.2-6 Give an example of a directed graph G D .V; E/, a source vertex s 2 V , and a set of tree edges E  ෂ E such that for each vertex v 2 V , the unique simple path in the graph .V; E  / from s to v is a shortest path in G, yet the set of edges E  cannot be produced by running BFS on G, no matter how the vertices are ordered in each adjacency list. 20.2-7 There are two types of professional wrestlers: <faces= (short for <babyfaces,= i.e., <good guys=) and <heels= (<bad guys=). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry. You are given the names of n profes- sional wrestlers and a list of r pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an O.n C r/-time algorithm that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as faces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a face and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should produce it. ? 20.2-8 The diameter of a tree T D .V; E/ is deûned as max fı.u; v/ W u; v 2 V g, that is, the largest of all shortest-path distances in the tree. Give an efûcient algorithm to compute the diameter of a tree, and analyze the running time of your algorithm. 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search As its name implies, depth-ûrst search searches <deeper= in the graph whenever possible. Depth-ûrst search explores edges out of the most recently discovered vertex v that still has unexplored edges leaving it. Once all of v’s edges have been explored, the search <backtracks= to explore edges leaving the vertex from which v was discovered. This process continues until all vertices that are reachable from the original source vertex have been discovered. If any undiscovered vertices remain, then depth-ûrst search selects one of them as a new source, repeating the search 564 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms from that source. The algorithm repeats this entire process until it has discovered every vertex. 3 As in breadth-ûrst search, whenever depth-ûrst search discovers a vertex v dur- ing a scan of the adjacency list of an already discovered vertex u, it records this event by setting v’s predecessor attribute v:� to u. Unlike breadth-ûrst search, whose predecessor subgraph forms a tree, depth-ûrst search produces a predeces- sor subgraph that might contain several trees, because the search may repeat from multiple sources. Therefore, we deûne the predecessor subgraph of a depth-ûrst search slightly differently from that of a breadth-ûrst search: it always includes all vertices, and it accounts for multiple sources. Speciûcally, for a depth-ûrst search the predecessor subgraph is G  D .V; E  /, where E  D f.v:�; v/ W v 2 V and v:� ¤ NILg : The predecessor subgraph of a depth-ûrst search forms a depth-ûrst forest com- prising several depth-ûrst trees. The edges in E  are tree edges. Like breadth-ûrst search, depth-ûrst search colors vertices during the search to indicate their state. Each vertex is initially white, is grayed when it is discovered in the search, and is blackened when it is ûnished, that is, when its adjacency list has been examined completely. This technique guarantees that each vertex ends up in exactly one depth-ûrst tree, so that these trees are disjoint. Besides creating a depth-ûrst forest, depth-ûrst search also timestamps each ver- tex. Each vertex v has two timestamps: the ûrst timestamp v: d records when v is ûrst discovered (and grayed), and the second timestamp v: f records when the search ûnishes examining v’s adjacency list (and blackens v). These timestamps provide important information about the structure of the graph and are generally helpful in reasoning about the behavior of depth-ûrst search. The procedure DFS on the facing page records when it discovers vertex u in the attribute u: d and when it ûnishes vertex u in the attribute u: f . These time- stamps are integers between 1 and 2 jV j, since there is one discovery event and one ûnishing event for each of the jV j vertices. For every vertex u, u: d < u: f : (20.4) Vertex u is WHITE before time u: d, GRAY between time u: d and time u: f , and BLAC K thereafter. In the DFS procedure, the input graph G may be undirected or 3 It may seem arbitrary that breadth-ûrst search is limited to only one source whereas depth-ûrst search may search from multiple sources. Although conceptually, breadth-ûrst search could proceed from multiple sources and depth-ûrst search could be limited to one source, our approach reüects how the results of these searches are typically used. Breadth-ûrst search usually serves to ûnd shortest- path distances and the associated predecessor subgraph from a given source. Depth-ûrst search is often a subroutine in another algorithm, as we’ll see later in this chapter. 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search 565 directed. The variable time is a global variable used for timestamping. Figure 20.4 illustrates the progress of DFS on the graph shown in Figure 20.2 (but with vertices labeled by letters rather than numbers).

Lines 133 paint all vertices white and initialize their � attributes to NIL. Line 4 resets the global time counter. Lines 537 check each vertex in V in turn and, when a white vertex is found, visit it by calling DFS-VISIT. Upon every call of DFS-VISIT .G; u/ in line 7, vertex u becomes the root of a new tree in the depth-ûrst forest. When DFS returns, every vertex u has been assigned a discovery time u: d and a ûnish time u: f . In each call DFS-VISIT .G; u/, vertex u is initially white. Lines 133 increment the global variable time, record the new value of time as the discovery time u: d, and paint u gray. Lines 437 examine each vertex v adjacent to u and recursively visit v if it is white. As line 4 considers each vertex v 2 AdjŒu�, the depth-ûrst search explores edge .u; v/. Finally, after every edge leaving u has been explored, lines 8310 increment time, record the ûnish time in u: f , and paint u black. The results of depth-ûrst search may depend upon the order in which line 5 of DFS examines the vertices and upon the order in which line 4 of DFS-V ISIT visits the neighbors of a vertex. These different visitation orders tend not to cause 566 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms u w x y z 1/ 1/ 2/ 1/ 2/ 3/ 1/ 2/ 3/ 4/ 1/ 2/ 3/ 4/ B 1/ 2/ 3/ B 4/5 1/ 2/ B 4/5 3/6 1/ B 4/5 3/6 2/7 1/ B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 9/ B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 9/ C B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 9/ C B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 9/ C B B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 9/ C B 4/5 3/6 2/7 F 1/8 C B 10/11 9/12 u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y z u w x y u w x y (m) (n) (o) (p) (i) (j) (k) (l) (e) (f) (g) (h) (a) (b) (c) (d) 10/ 10/ 10/11 z B T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T z v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v Figure 20.4 The progress of the depth-ûrst-search algorithm DFS on a directed graph.

What is the running time of DFS? The loops on lines 133 and lines 537 of DFS take ‚.V / time, exclusive of the time to execute the calls to DFS-VISIT. As we did for breadth-ûrst search, we use aggregate analysis. The procedure DFS-V ISIT is called exactly once for each vertex v 2 V , since the vertex u on which DFS-VISIT is invoked must be white and the ûrst thing DFS-VISIT does is paint vertex u gray. During an execution of DFS-VISIT .G; v/, the loop in lines 437 executes jAdjŒv�j times. Since P v2V jAdjŒv�j D ‚.E/ and DFS-VISIT is called once per vertex, the 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search 567 total cost of executing lines 437 of DFS-VISIT is ‚.V C E/. The running time of DFS is therefore ‚.V C E/. Properties of depth-ﬁrst search Depth-ûrst search yields valuable information about the structure of a graph. Per- haps the most basic property of depth-ûrst search is that the predecessor sub- graph G  does indeed form a forest of trees, since the structure of the depth- ûrst trees exactly mirrors the structure of recursive calls of DFS-VISIT. That is, u D v:� if and only if DFS-VISIT .G; v/ was called during a search of u’s ad- jacency list. Additionally, vertex v is a descendant of vertex u in the depth-ûrst forest if and only if v is discovered during the time in which u is gray. Another important property of depth-ûrst search is that discovery and ûnish times have parenthesis structure. If the DFS-VISIT procedure were to print a left parenthesis <.u= when it discovers vertex u and to print a right parenthesis <u/= when it ûnishes u, then the printed expression would be well formed in the sense that the parentheses are properly nested. For example, the depth-ûrst search of Figure 20.5(a) corresponds to the parenthesization shown in Figure 20.5(b). The following theorem provides another way to characterize the parenthesis structure. Theorem 20.7 (Parenthesis theorem) In any depth-ûrst search of a (directed or undirected) graph G D .V; E/, for any two vertices u and v, exactly one of the following three conditions holds:  the intervals Œu: d; u: f � and Œv: d; v: f � are entirely disjoint, and neither u nor v is a descendant of the other in the depth-ûrst forest,  the interval Œu: d; u: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œv: d; v: f �, and u is a descendant of v in a depth-ûrst tree, or  the interval Œv: d; v: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œu: d; u: f �, and v is a descendant of u in a depth-ûrst tree. Proof We begin with the case in which u: d < v: d. We consider two subcases, according to whether v: d < u: f . The ûrst subcase occurs when v: d < u: f , so that v was discovered while u was still gray, which implies that v is a descendant of u. Moreover, since v was discovered after u, all of its outgoing edges are explored, and v is ûnished, before the search returns to and ûnishes u. In this case, therefore, the interval Œv: d; v: f � is entirely contained within the interval Œu: d; u: f �. In the other subcase, u: f < v: d, and by inequality (20.4), u: d < u: f < v: d < v: f , and thus the intervals Œu: d; u: f � and Œv: d; v: f � are disjoint. Because the intervals are disjoint, neither vertex was discovered while the other was gray, and so neither vertex is a descendant of the other. 568 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 3/6 2/9 1/10 11/16 14/15 12/13 7/8 4/5 y z s t u w x B C F C C C B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 s z y w x t u C F B C C B C (a) (b) (c) (s (z (y (x x) y) (w w) z) s) (t ( ) (u u) t) T T T T T T T T T T T s t z y w x u T v v v v v Figure 20.5 Properties of depth-ûrst search. (a) The result of a depth-ûrst search of a directed graph. Vertices are timestamped and edge types are indicated as in Figure 20.4. (b) Intervals for the discovery time and ûnish time of each vertex correspond to the parenthesization shown. Each rectangle spans the interval given by the discovery and ûnish times of the corresponding vertex. Only tree edges are shown. If two intervals overlap, then one is nested within the other, and the vertex corresponding to the smaller interval is a descendant of the vertex corresponding to the larger. (c) The graph of part (a) redrawn with all tree and forward edges going down within a depth-ûrst tree and all back edges going up from a descendant to an ancestor. The case in which v: d < u: d is similar, with the roles of u and v reversed in the above argument. Corollary 20.8 (Nesting of descendants’ intervals) Vertex v is a proper descendant of vertex u in the depth-ûrst forest for a (directed or undirected) graph G if and only if u: d < v: d < v: f < u: f . Proof Immediate from Theorem 20.7. The next theorem gives another important characterization of when one vertex is a descendant of another in the depth-ûrst forest. 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search 569 Theorem 20.9 (White-path theorem) In a depth-ûrst forest of a (directed or undirected) graph G D .V; E/, vertex v is a descendant of vertex u if and only if at the time u: d that the search discovers u, there is a path from u to v consisting entirely of white vertices. Proof ): If v D u, then the path from u to v contains just vertex u, which is still white when u: d receives a value. Now, suppose that v is a proper descendant of u in the depth-ûrst forest. By Corollary 20.8, u: d < v: d, and so v is white at time u: d. Since v can be any descendant of u, all vertices on the unique simple path from u to v in the depth-ûrst forest are white at time u: d. (: Suppose that there is a path of white vertices from u to v at time u: d, but v does not become a descendant of u in the depth-ûrst tree. Without loss of gener- ality, assume that every vertex other than v along the path becomes a descendant of u. (Otherwise, let v be the closest vertex to u along the path that doesn’t be- come a descendant of u.) Let w be the predecessor of v in the path, so that w is a descendant of u (w and u may in fact be the same vertex). By Corollary 20.8, w: f හ u: f . Because v must be discovered after u is discovered, but before w is ûnished, u: d < v: d < w: f හ u: f . Theorem 20.7 then implies that the interval Œv: d; v: f � is contained entirely within the interval Œu: d; u: f �. By Corollary 20.8, v must after all be a descendant of u. Classiﬁcation of edges You can obtain important information about a graph by classifying its edges during a depth-ûrst search. For example, Section 20.4 will show that a directed graph is acyclic if and only if a depth-ûrst search yields no <back= edges (Lemma 20.11). The depth-ûrst forest G  produced by a depth-ûrst search on graph G can con- tain four types of edges: 1. Tree edges are edges in the depth-ûrst forest G  . Edge .u; v/ is a tree edge if v was ûrst discovered by exploring edge .u; v/. 2. Back edges are those edges .u; v/ connecting a vertex u to an ancestor v in a depth-ûrst tree. We consider self-loops, which may occur in directed graphs, to be back edges. 3. Forward edges are those nontree edges .u; v/ connecting a vertex u to a proper descendant v in a depth-ûrst tree. 4. Cross edges are all other edges. They can go between vertices in the same depth-ûrst tree, as long as one vertex is not an ancestor of the other, or they can go between vertices in different depth-ûrst trees. 570 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms In Figures 20.4 and 20.5, edge labels indicate edge types. Figure 20.5(c) also shows how to redraw the graph of Figure 20.5(a) so that all tree and forward edges head downward in a depth-ûrst tree and all back edges go up. You can redraw any graph in this fashion. The DFS algorithm has enough information to classify some edges as it encoun- ters them. The key idea is that when an edge .u; v/ is ûrst explored, the color of vertex v says something about the edge: 1. WHITE indicates a tree edge, 2. GRAY indicates a back edge, and 3. BLAC K indicates a forward or cross edge. The ûrst case is immediate from the speciûcation of the algorithm. For the sec- ond case, observe that the gray vertices always form a linear chain of descendants corresponding to the stack of active DFS-VISIT invocations. The number of gray vertices is 1 more than the depth in the depth-ûrst forest of the vertex most recently discovered. Depth-ûrst search always explores from the deepest gray vertex, so that an edge that reaches another gray vertex has reached an ancestor. The third case handles the remaining possibility. Exercise 20.3-5 asks you to show that such an edge .u; v/ is a forward edge if u: d < v: d and a cross edge if u: d > v: d. According to the following theorem, forward and cross edges never occur in a depth-ûrst search of an undirected graph. Theorem 20.10 In a depth-ûrst search of an undirected graph G, every edge of G is either a tree edge or a back edge. Proof Let .u; v/ be an arbitrary edge of G, and suppose without loss of generality that u: d < v: d. Then, while u is gray, the search must discover and ûnish v before it ûnishes u, since v is on u’s adjacency list. If the ûrst time that the search explores edge .u; v/, it is in the direction from u to v, then v is undiscovered (white) until that time, for otherwise the search would have explored this edge already in the direction from v to u. Thus, .u; v/ becomes a tree edge. If the search explores .u; v/ ûrst in the direction from v to u, then .u; v/ is a back edge, since there must be a path of tree edges from u to v. Since .u; v/ and .v; u/ are really the same edge in an undirected graph, the proof of Theorem 20.10 says how to classify the edge. When searching from a vertex, which must be gray, if the adjacent vertex is white, then the edge is a tree edge. Otherwise, the edge is a back edge. The next two sections apply the above theorems about depth-ûrst search. 20.3 Depth-ﬁrst search 571 q r s t u w x y z v Figure 20.6 A directed graph for use in Exercises 20.3-2 and 20.5-2.

Show what modiûcations, if any, you need to make if G is undirected. 20.3-10 Explain how a vertex u of a directed graph can end up in a depth-ûrst tree contain- ing only u, even though u has both incoming and outgoing edges in G. 20.3-11 Let G D .V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph. Give an O.V C E/-time algo- rithm to compute a path in G that traverses each edge in E exactly once in each direction. Describe how you can ûnd your way out of a maze if you are given a large supply of pennies. 20.3-12 Show how to use a depth-ûrst search of an undirected graph G to identify the connected components of G, so that the depth-ûrst forest contains as many trees as G has connected components. More precisely, show how to modify depth-ûrst search so that it assigns to each vertex v an integer label v: cc between 1 and k, where k is the number of connected components of G, such that u: cc D v: cc if and only if u and v belong to the same connected component. ? 20.3-13 A directed graph G D .V; E/ is singly connected if u ❀ v implies that G contains at most one simple path from u to v for all vertices u; v 2 V . Give an efûcient algorithm to determine whether a directed graph is singly connected. 20.4 Topological sort 573 20.4 Topological sort This section shows how to use depth-ûrst search to perform a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph, or a <dag= as it is sometimes called. A topological sort of a dag G D .V; E/ is a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if G contains an edge .u; v/, then u appears before v in the ordering. Topological sorting is deûned only on directed graphs that are acyclic; no linear ordering is possible when a directed graph contains a cycle. Think of a topological sort of a graph as an ordering of its vertices along a horizontal line so that all directed edges go from left to right. Topological sorting is thus different from the usual kind of <sorting= studied in Part II. Many applications use directed acyclic graphs to indicate precedences among events. Figure 20.7 gives an example that arises when Professor Bumstead gets dressed in the morning. The professor must don certain garments before others (e.g., socks before shoes). Other items may be put on in any order (e.g., socks and pants). A directed edge .u; v/ in the dag of Figure 20.7(a) indicates that garment u must be donned before garment v. A topological sort of this dag therefore gives a possible order for getting dressed. Figure 20.7(b) shows the topologically sorted dag as an ordering of vertices along a horizontal line such that all directed edges go from left to right. The procedure TOPOLOGICAL-SORT topologically sorts a dag. Figure 20.7(b) shows how the topologically sorted vertices appear in reverse order of their ûnish times. TOPOLOGICAL-SORT .G/ 1 call DFS.G/ to compute ûnish times v: f for each vertex v 2 as each vertex is ûnished, insert it onto the front of a linked list 3 return the linked list of vertices The TOPOLOGICAL-SORT procedure runs in ‚.V C E/ time, since depth-ûrst search takes ‚.V CE/ time and it takes O.1/ time to insert each of the jV j vertices onto the front of the linked list. To prove the correctness of this remarkably simple and efûcient algorithm, we start with the following key lemma characterizing directed acyclic graphs. Lemma 20.11 A directed graph G is acyclic if and only if a depth-ûrst search of G yields no back edges. 574 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 11/16 12/15 6/7 1/8 2/5 3/4 17/18 13/14 9/10 17/18 11/16 12/15 13/14 9/10 1/8 6/7 2/5 3/4 (a) (b) undershorts pants belt shirt tie jacket socks shoes watch socks undershorts pants shoes watch shirt belt tie jacket Figure 20.7 (a) Professor Bumstead topologically sorts his clothing when getting dressed. Each directed edge .u; v/ means that garment u must be put on before garment v. The discovery and ûnish times from a depth-ûrst search are shown next to each vertex. (b) The same graph shown topologically sorted, with its vertices arranged from left to right in order of decreasing ûnish time. All directed edges go from left to right. Proof ): Suppose that a depth-ûrst search produces a back edge .u; v/. Then vertex v is an ancestor of vertex u in the depth-ûrst forest. Thus, G contains a path from v to u, and the back edge .u; v/ completes a cycle. (: Suppose that G contains a cycle c . We show that a depth-ûrst search of G yields a back edge. Let v be the ûrst vertex to be discovered in c , and let .u; v/ be the preceding edge in c . At time v: d, the vertices of c form a path of white vertices from v to u. By the white-path theorem, vertex u becomes a descendant of v in the depth-ûrst forest. Therefore, .u; v/ is a back edge. Theorem 20.12 TOPOLOGICAL-SORT produces a topological sort of the directed acyclic graph provided as its input. Proof Suppose that DFS is run on a given dag G D .V; E/ to determine ûn- ish times for its vertices. It sufûces to show that for any pair of distinct ver- tices u; v 2 V , if G contains an edge from u to v, then v: f < u: f . Consider any edge .u; v/ explored by DFS.G/. When this edge is explored, v cannot be gray, since then v would be an ancestor of u and .u; v/ would be a back edge, contradicting Lemma 20.11. Therefore, v must be either white or black. If v is 20.4 Topological sort 575 z y x w u t s r q p o n m v Figure 20.8 A dag for topological sorting. white, it becomes a descendant of u, and so v: f < u: f . If v is black, it has already been ûnished, so that v: f has already been set. Because the search is still exploring from u, it has yet to assign a timestamp to u: f , so that the timestamp eventually assigned to u: f is greater than v: f . Thus, v: f < u: f for any edge .u; v/ in the dag, proving the theorem. Exercises 20.4-1 Show the ordering of vertices produced by TOPOLOGICAL-SORT when it is run on the dag of Figure 20.8. Assume that the for loop of lines 537 of the DFS procedure considers the vertices in alphabetical order, and assume that each adjacency list is ordered alphabetically. 20.4-2 Give a linear-time algorithm that, given a directed acyclic graph G D .V; E/ and two vertices a; b 2 V , returns the number of simple paths from a to b in G. For example, the directed acyclic graph of Figure 20.8 contains exactly four simple paths from vertex p to vertex v: hp; o; vi, hp; o; r; y; vi, hp; o; s; r; y; vi, and hp; s; r; y; vi. Your algorithm needs only to count the simple paths, not list them. 20.4-3 Give an algorithm that determines whether an undirected graph G D .V; E/ con- tains a simple cycle. Your algorithm should run in O.V / time, independent of jEj. 20.4-4 Prove or disprove: If a directed graph G contains cycles, then the vertex ordering produced by TOPOLOGICAL-SORT .G/ minimizes the number of <bad= edges that are inconsistent with the ordering produced. 576 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 20.4-5 Another way to topologically sort a directed acyclic graph G D .V; E/ is to re- peatedly ûnd a vertex of in-degree 0, output it, and remove it and all of its outgo- ing edges from the graph. Explain how to implement this idea so that it runs in time O.V C E/. What happens to this algorithm if G has cycles? 20.5 Strongly connected components We now consider a classic application of depth-ûrst search: decomposing a di- rected graph into its strongly connected components. This section shows how to do so using two depth-ûrst searches. Many algorithms that work with directed graphs begin with such a decomposition. After decomposing the graph into strongly con- nected components, such algorithms run separately on each one and then combine the solutions according to the structure of connections among components. Recall from Appendix B that a strongly connected component of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is a maximal set of vertices C ෂ V such that for every pair of vertices u; v 2 C , both u ❀ v and v ❀ u, that is, vertices u and v are reachable from each other. Figure 20.9 shows an example. The algorithm for ûnding the strongly connected components of a directed graph G D .V; E/ uses the transpose of G, which we deûned in Exercise 20.1-3 to be the graph G T D .V; E T /, where E T D f.u; v/ W .v; u/ 2 Eg. That is, E T consists of the edges of G with their directions reversed. Given an adjacency-list repre- sentation of G, the time to create G T is ‚.V C E/. The graphs G and G T have exactly the same strongly connected components: u and v are reachable from each other in G if and only if they are reachable from each other in G T . Figure 20.9(b) shows the transpose of the graph in Figure 20.9(a), with the strongly connected components shaded blue in both parts. The linear-time (i.e., ‚.V C E/-time) procedure STRONGLY-CONNECTED- COMPONENTS on the next page computes the strongly connected components of a directed graph G D .V; E/ using two depth-ûrst searches, one on G and one on G T . The idea behind this algorithm comes from a key property of the component graph G SCC D .V SCC ; E SCC /, deûned as follows. Suppose that G has strongly connected components C 1 ; C 2 ; : : : ; C k . The vertex set V SCC is fv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k g, and it contains one vertex v i for each strongly connected component C i of G. There is an edge .v i ; v j / 2 E SCC if G contains a directed edge .x; y/ for some x 2 C i and some y 2 C j . Looked at another way, if we contract all edges whose incident vertices are within the same strongly connected component of G so that 20.5 Strongly connected components 577 13/14 11/16 12/15 3/4 2/7 5/6 a b c d e f g h abe cd fg h (c) (b) (a) 1/10 8/9 a b c d e f g h Figure 20.9 (a) A directed graph G. Each region shaded light blue is a strongly connected com- ponent of G. Each vertex is labeled with its discovery and ûnish times in a depth-ûrst search, and tree edges are dark blue. (b) The graph G T , the transpose of G, with the depth-ûrst forest computed in line 3 of S TRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS shown and tree edges shaded dark blue. Each strongly connected component corresponds to one depth-ûrst tree. Orange vertices b, c, g, and h are the roots of the depth-ûrst trees produced by the depth-ûrst search of G T . (c) The acyclic component graph G SCC obtained by contracting all edges within each strongly connected component of G so that only a single vertex remains in each component. STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS .G/ 1 call DFS.G/ to compute ûnish times u: f for each vertex u 2 create G T 3 call DFS.G T /, but in the main loop of DFS, consider the vertices in order of decreasing u: f (as computed in line 1) 4 output the vertices of each tree in the depth-ûrst forest formed in line 3 as a separate strongly connected component only a single vertex remains, the resulting graph is G SCC . Figure 20.9(c) shows the component graph of the graph in Figure 20.9(a). The following lemma gives the key property that the component graph is acyclic. We’ll see that the algorithm uses this property to visit the vertices of the component graph in topologically sorted order, by considering vertices in the second depth- ûrst search in decreasing order of the ûnish times that were computed in the ûrst depth-ûrst search. 578 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms Lemma 20.13 Let C and C 0 be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G D .V; E/, let u; v 2 C , let u 0 ; v 0 2 C 0 , and suppose that G contains a path u ❀ u 0 . Then G cannot also contain a path v 0 ❀ v. Proof If G contains a path v 0 ❀ v, then it contains paths u ❀ u 0 ❀ v 0 and v 0 ❀ v ❀ u. Thus, u and v 0 are reachable from each other, thereby contradicting the assumption that C and C 0 are distinct strongly connected components. Because the STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure performs two depth-ûrst searches, there are two distinct sets of discovery and ûnish times. In this section, discovery and ûnish times always refer to those computed by the ﬁrst call of DFS, in line 1. The notation for discovery and ûnish times extends to sets of vertices. For a subset U of vertices, d.U / and f .U / are the earliest discovery time and latest ûnish time, respectively, of any vertex in U : d.U / D min fu: d W u 2 U g and f .U / D max fu: f W u 2 U g. The following lemma and its corollary give a key property relating strongly con- nected components and ûnish times in the ûrst depth-ûrst search. Lemma 20.14 Let C and C 0 be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G D .V; E/. Suppose that there is an edge .u; v/ 2 E, where u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Then f .C 0 / > f .C /. Proof We consider two cases, depending on which strongly connected compo- nent, C or C 0 , had the ûrst discovered vertex during the ûrst depth-ûrst search. If d.C 0 / < d.C /, let x be the ûrst vertex discovered in C 0 . At time x: d, all ver- tices in C and C 0 are white. At that time, G contains a path from x to each vertex in C 0 consisting only of white vertices. Because .u; v/ 2 E, for any vertex w 2 C , there is also a path in G at time x: d from x to w consisting only of white vertices: x ❀ u ! v ❀ w. By the white-path theorem, all vertices in C and C 0 become descendants of x in the depth-ûrst tree. By Corollary 20.8, x has the latest ûnish time of any of its descendants, and so x: f D f .C 0 / > f .C /. Otherwise, d.C 0 / > d.C /. Let y be the ûrst vertex discovered in C , so that y: d D d.C /. At time y: d, all vertices in C are white and G contains a path from y to each vertex in C consisting only of white vertices. By the white-path theorem, all vertices in C become descendants of y in the depth-ûrst tree, and by Corollary 20.8, y: f D f .C /. Because d.C 0 / > d.C / D y: d, all vertices in C 0 are white at time y: d. Since there is an edge .u; v/ from C 0 to C , Lemma 20.13 implies that there cannot be a path from C to C 0 . Hence, no vertex in C 0 is reachable 20.5 Strongly connected components 579 from y . At time y: f , therefore, all vertices in C 0 are still white. Thus, for any vertex w 2 C 0 , we have w: f > y: f , which implies that f .C 0 / > f .C /. Corollary 20.15 Let C and C 0 be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G D .V; E/, and suppose that f .C / > f .C 0 /. Then E T contains no edge .v; u/ such that u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Proof The contrapositive of Lemma 20.14 says that if f .C 0 / < f .C /, then there is no edge .u; v/ 2 E such that u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Because the strongly connected components of G and G T are the same, if there is no such edge .u; v/ 2 E, then there is no edge .v; u/ 2 E T such that u 2 C 0 and v 2 C . Corollary 20.15 provides the key to understanding why the strongly connected components algorithm works. Let9s examine what happens during the second depth-ûrst search, which is on G T . The search starts from the vertex x whose ûnish time from the ûrst depth-ûrst search is maximum. This vertex belongs to some strongly connected component C , and since x: f is maximum, f .C / is max- imum over all strongly connected components. When the search starts from x , it visits all vertices in C . By Corollary 20.15, G T contains no edges from C to any other strongly connected component, and so the search from x never visits vertices in any other component. Thus, the tree rooted at x contains exactly the vertices of C . Having completed visiting all vertices in C , the second depth-ûrst search selects as a new root a vertex from some other strongly connected component C 0 whose ûnish time f .C 0 / is maximum over all components other than C . Again, the search visits all vertices in C 0 . But by Corollary 20.15, if any edges in G T go from C 0 to any other component, they must go to C , which the second depth-ûrst search has already visited. In general, when the depth-ûrst search of G T in line 3 visits any strongly connected component, any edges out of that component must be to components that the search has already visited. Each depth-ûrst tree, therefore, corresponds to exactly one strongly connected component. The following theorem formalizes this argument. Theorem 20.16 The STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure correctly computes the strongly connected components of the directed graph G provided as its input. Proof We argue by induction on the number of depth-ûrst trees found in the depth-ûrst search of G T in line 3 that the vertices of each tree form a strongly connected component. The inductive hypothesis is that the ûrst k trees produced 580 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms in line 3 are strongly connected components. The basis for the induction, when k D 0, is trivial. In the inductive step, we assume that each of the ûrst k depth-ûrst trees pro- duced in line 3 is a strongly connected component, and we consider the .k C 1/st tree produced. Let the root of this tree be vertex u, and let u be in strongly con- nected component C . Because of how the depth-ûrst search chooses roots in line 3, u: f D f .C / > f .C 0 / for any strongly connected component C 0 other than C that has yet to be visited. By the inductive hypothesis, at the time that the search vis- its u, all other vertices of C are white. By the white-path theorem, therefore, all other vertices of C are descendants of u in its depth-ûrst tree. Moreover, by the inductive hypothesis and by Corollary 20.15, any edges in G T that leave C must be to strongly connected components that have already been visited. Thus, no vertex in any strongly connected component other than C is a descendant of u during the depth-ûrst search of G T . The vertices of the depth-ûrst tree in G T that is rooted at u form exactly one strongly connected component, which completes the induc- tive step and the proof. Here is another way to look at how the second depth-ûrst search operates. Con- sider the component graph .G T / SCC of G T . If you map each strongly connected component visited in the second depth-ûrst search to a vertex of .G T / SCC , the sec- ond depth-ûrst search visits vertices of .G T / SCC in the reverse of a topologically sorted order. If you reverse the edges of .G T / SCC , you get the graph ..G T / SCC / T . Because ..G T / SCC / T D G SCC (see Exercise 20.5-4), the second depth-ûrst search visits the vertices of G SCC in topologically sorted order. Exercises 20.5-1 How can the number of strongly connected components of a graph change if a new edge is added? 20.5-2 Show how the procedure STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS works on the graph of Figure 20.6. Speciûcally, show the ûnish times computed in line 1 and the forest produced in line 3.

(Hint: Use Exercise 20.5-5.) Problems 20-1 Classifying edges by breadth-ûrst search A depth-ûrst forest classiûes the edges of a graph into tree, back, forward, and cross edges. A breadth-ûrst tree can also be used to classify the edges reachable from the source of the search into the same four categories. 582 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 1 2 4 5 6 Figure 20.10 The articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components of a connected, undi- rected graph for use in Problem 20-2.

An articulation point of G is a vertex whose removal disconnects G. A bridge of G is an edge whose removal disconnects G. A biconnected component of G is a maximal set of edges such that any two edges in the set lie on a common simple cycle. Figure 20.10 illustrates these deûnitions. You can determine articulation points, bridges, and biconnected components using depth-ûrst search. Let G  D .V; E  / be a depth-ûrst tree of G. a.

Deûne min.u/ to be the vertex in R.u/ whose label is minimum, that is, min.u/ is the vertex v such that L.v/ D min fL.w/ W w 2 R.u/g. Give an O.V C E/-time algorithm that computes min.u/ for all vertices u 2 V . 584 Chapter 20 Elementary Graph Algorithms 20-5 Inserting and querying vertices in planar graphs A planar graph is an undirected graph that can be drawn in the plane with no edges crossing. Euler proved that every planar graph has jEj < 3 jV j. Consider the following two operations on a planar graph G:  I NSERT.G; v; neighbors / inserts a new vertex v into G, where neighbors is an array (possibly empty) of vertices that have already been inserted into G and will become all the neighbors of v in G when v is inserted.  NEWEST-NEIGHBOR .G; v/ returns the neighbor of vertex v that was most re- cently inserted into G, or NIL if v has no neighbors. Design a data structure that supports these two operations such that N EWEST- NEIGHBOR takes O.1/ worst-case time and I NSERT takes O.1/ amortized time. Note that the length of the array neighbors given to I NSERT may vary. (Hint: Use a potential function for the amortized analysis.) Chapter notes Even [137] and Tarjan [429] are excellent references for graph algorithms. Breadth-ûrst search was discovered by Moore [334] in the context of ûnding paths through mazes. Lee [280] independently discovered the same algorithm in the context of routing wires on circuit boards. Hopcroft and Tarjan [226] advocated the use of the adjacency-list representation over the adjacency-matrix representation for sparse graphs and were the ûrst to recognize the algorithmic importance of depth-ûrst search. Depth-ûrst search has been widely used since the late 1950s, especially in artiûcial intelligence programs. Tarjan [426] gave a linear-time algorithm for ûnding strongly connected compo- nents. The algorithm for strongly connected components in Section 20.5 is adapted from Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [6], who credit it to S. R. Kosaraju (unpub- lished) and Sharir [408]. Dijkstra [117, Chapter 25] also developed an algorithm for strongly connected components that is based on contracting cycles. Subse- quently, Gabow [163] rediscovered this algorithm. Knuth [259] was the ûrst to give a linear-time algorithm for topological sorting. 21 Minimum Spanning Trees Electronic circuit designs often need to make the pins of several components elec- trically equivalent by wiring them together. To interconnect a set of n pins, the designer can use an arrangement of n  1 wires, each connecting two pins. Of all such arrangements, the one that uses the least amount of wire is usually the most desirable. To model this wiring problem, use a connected, undirected graph G D .V; E/, where V is the set of pins, E is the set of possible interconnections between pairs of pins, and for each edge .u; v/ 2 E, a weight w.u; v/ speciûes the cost (amount of wire needed) to connect u and v. The goal is to ûnd an acyclic subset T ෂ E that connects all of the vertices and whose total weight w.T / D X .u;v/2T w.u; v/ is minimized. Since T is acyclic and connects all of the vertices, it must form a tree, which we call a spanning tree since it <spans= the graph G. We call the problem of determining the tree T the minimum-spanning-tree problem. 1 Figure 21.1 shows an example of a connected graph and a minimum spanning tree. This chapter studies two ways to solve the minimum-spanning-tree problem. Kruskal9s algorithm and Prim9s algorithm both run in O.E lg V / time. Prim9s algorithm achieves this bound by using a binary heap as a priority queue. By using Fibonacci heaps instead (see page 478), Prim9s algorithm runs in O.E C V lg V / time. This bound is better than O.E lg V / whenever jEj grows asymptotically faster than jV j. 1 The phrase <minimum spanning tree= is a shortened form of the phrase <minimum-weight spanning tree.= There is no point in minimizing the number of edges in T , since all spanning trees have exactly jV j  1 edges by Theorem B.2 on page 1169. 586 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 Figure 21.1 A minimum spanning tree for a connected graph. The weights on edges are shown, and the blue edges form a minimum spanning tree. The total weight of the tree shown is 37. This minimum spanning tree is not unique: removing the edge .b; c/ and replacing it with the edge .a; h/ yields another spanning tree with weight 37. The two algorithms are greedy algorithms, as described in Chapter 15. Each step of a greedy algorithm must make one of several possible choices. The greedy strat- egy advocates making the choice that is the best at the moment. Such a strategy does not generally guarantee that it always ûnds globally optimal solutions to prob- lems. For the minimum-spanning-tree problem, however, we can prove that certain greedy strategies do yield a spanning tree with minimum weight. Although you can read this chapter independently of Chapter 15, the greedy methods presented here are a classic application of the theoretical notions introduced there. Section 21.1 introduces a <generic= minimum-spanning-tree method that grows a spanning tree by adding one edge at a time. Section 21.2 gives two algorithms that implement the generic method. The ûrst algorithm, due to Kruskal, is similar to the connected-components algorithm from Section 19.1. The second, due to Prim, resembles Dijkstra9s shortest-paths algorithm (Section 22.3). Because a tree is a type of graph, in order to be precise we must deûne a tree in terms of not just its edges, but its vertices as well. Because this chapter focuses on trees in terms of their edges, we9ll implicitly understand that the vertices of a tree T are those that some edge of T is incident on. 21.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree The input to the minumum-spanning-tree problem is a connected, undirected graph G D .V; E/ with a weight function w W E ! R. The goal is to ûnd a minimum spanning tree for G. The two algorithms considered in this chapter use a greedy approach to the problem, although they differ in how they apply this approach. This greedy strategy is captured by the procedure GENERIC-MST on the facing page, which grows the minimum spanning tree one edge at a time. The generic method manages a set A of edges, maintaining the following loop invariant: Prior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree. 21.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree 587 GENERIC-MST .G; w/ 1 A D ; 2 while A does not form a spanning tree 3 ûnd an edge .u; v/ that is safe for A 4 A D A [ f.u; v/g 5 return A Each step determines an edge .u; v/ that the procedure can add to A without violating this invariant, in the sense that A [ f.u; v/g is also a subset of a minimum spanning tree. We call such an edge a safe edge for A, since it can be added safely to A while maintaining the invariant. This generic algorithm uses the loop invariant as follows: Initialization: After line 1, the set A trivially satisûes the loop invariant. Maintenance: The loop in lines 234 maintains the invariant by adding only safe edges. Termination: All edges added to A belong to a minimum spanning tree, and the loop must terminate by the time it has considered all edges. Therefore, the set A returned in line 5 must be a minimum spanning tree. The tricky part is, of course, ûnding a safe edge in line 3. One must exist, since when line 3 is executed, the invariant dictates that there is a spanning tree T such that A ෂ T . Within the while loop body, A must be a proper subset of T , and therefore there must be an edge .u; v/ 2 T such that .u; v/ … A and .u; v/ is safe for A. The remainder of this section provides a rule (Theorem 21.1) for recognizing safe edges. The next section describes two algorithms that use this rule to ûnd safe edges efûciently. We ûrst need some deûnitions. A cut .S; V  S/ of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a partition of V . Figure 21.2 illustrates this notion. We say that an edge .u; v/ 2 E crosses the cut .S; V  S/ if one of its endpoints belongs to S and the other belongs to V  S . A cut respects a set A of edges if no edge in A crosses the cut. An edge is a light edge crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of any edge crossing the cut. There can be more than one light edge crossing a cut in the case of ties. More generally, we say that an edge is a light edge satisfying a given property if its weight is the minimum of any edge satisfying the property. The following theorem gives the rule for recognizing safe edges. Theorem 21.1 Let G D .V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight func- tion w deûned on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum 588 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 S V – S S V – S Figure 21.2 A cut .S; V  S/ of the graph from Figure 21.1. Orange vertices belong to the set S , and tan vertices belong to V  S . The edges crossing the cut are those connecting tan vertices with orange vertices. The edge .d; c/ is the unique light edge crossing the cut. Blue edges form a subset A of the edges. The cut .S; V  S/ respects A, since no edge of A crosses the cut. spanning tree for G, let .S; V  S/ be any cut of G that respects A, and let .u; v/ be a light edge crossing .S; V  S/. Then, edge .u; v/ is safe for A. Proof Let T be a minimum spanning tree that includes A, and assume that T does not contain the light edge .u; v/, since if it does, we are done. We9ll construct another minimum spanning tree T 0 that includes A [ f.u; v/g by using a cut-and- paste technique, thereby showing that .u; v/ is a safe edge for A. The edge .u; v/ forms a cycle with the edges on the simple path p from u to v in T , as Figure 21.3 illustrates. Since u and v are on opposite sides of the cut .S; V  S/, at least one edge in T lies on the simple path p and also crosses the cut. Let .x; y/ be any such edge. The edge .x; y/ is not in A, because the cut respects A. Since .x; y/ is on the unique simple path from u to v in T , remov- ing .x; y/ breaks T into two components. Adding .u; v/ reconnects them to form a new spanning tree T 0 D .T  f.x; y/g/ [ f.u; v/g. We next show that T 0 is a minimum spanning tree. Since .u; v/ is a light edge crossing .S; V  S/ and .x; y/ also crosses this cut, w.u; v/ හ w.x; y/. Therefore, w.T 0 / D w.T /  w.x; y/ C w.u; v/ හ w.T / : But T is a minimum spanning tree, so that w.T / හ w.T 0 /, and thus, T 0 must be a minimum spanning tree as well. It remains to show that .u; v/ is actually a safe edge for A. We have A ෂ T 0 , since A ෂ T and .x; y/ … A, and thus, A [ f.u; v/g ෂ T 0 . Consequently, since T 0 is a minimum spanning tree, .u; v/ is safe for A. Theorem 21.1 provides insight into how the GENERIC-MST method works on a connected graph G D .V; E/. As the method proceeds, the set A is always acyclic, since it is a subset of a minimum spanning tree and a tree may not contain a cycle. 21.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree 589 y u x p v Figure 21.3 The proof of Theorem 21.1. Orange vertices belong to S , and tan vertices belong to V  S . Only edges in the minimum spanning tree T are shown, along with edge .u; v/, which does not lie in T . The edges in A are blue, and .u; v/ is a light edge crossing the cut .S; V  S/. The edge .x; y/ is an edge on the unique simple path p from u to v in T . To form a minimum spanning tree T 0 that contains .u; v/, remove the edge .x; y/ from T and add the edge .u; v/. At any point in the execution, the graph G A D .V; A/ is a forest, and each of the connected components of G A is a tree. (Some of the trees may contain just one vertex, as is the case, for example, when the method begins: A is empty and the forest contains jV j trees, one for each vertex.) Moreover, any safe edge .u; v/ for A connects distinct components of G A , since A [ f.u; v/g must be acyclic. The while loop in lines 234 of GENERIC-MST executes jV j  1 times because it ûnds one of the jV j  1 edges of a minimum spanning tree in each iteration. Initially, when A D ;, there are jV j trees in G A , and each iteration reduces that number by 1. When the forest contains only a single tree, the method terminates. The two algorithms in Section 21.2 use the following corollary to Theorem 21.1. Corollary 21.2 Let G D .V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight func- tion w deûned on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, and let C D .V C ; E C / be a connected component (tree) in the forest G A D .V; A/. If .u; v/ is a light edge connecting C to some other component in G A , then .u; v/ is safe for A. Proof The cut .V C ; V  V C / respects A, and .u; v/ is a light edge for this cut. Therefore, .u; v/ is safe for A. 590 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees Exercises 21.1-1 Let .u; v/ be a minimum-weight edge in a connected graph G. Show that .u; v/ belongs to some minimum spanning tree of G. 21.1-2 Professor Sabatier conjectures the following converse of Theorem 21.1. Let G D .V; E/ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w de- ûned on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let .S; V  S/ be any cut of G that respects A, and let .u; v/ be a safe edge for A crossing .S; V  S/. Then, .u; v/ is a light edge for the cut. Show that the professor9s conjecture is incorrect by giving a counterexample. 21.1-3 Show that if an edge .u; v/ is contained in some minimum spanning tree, then it is a light edge crossing some cut of the graph. 21.1-4 Give a simple example of a connected graph such that the set of edges f.u; v/ W there exists a cut .S; V  S/ such that .u; v/ is a light edge crossing .S; V  S/g does not form a minimum spanning tree. 21.1-5 Let e be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of connected graph G D .V; E/. Prove that there is a minimum spanning tree of G 0 D .V; E  feg/ that is also a minimum spanning tree of G. That is, there is a minimum spanning tree of G that does not include e. 21.1-6 Show that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the graph, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not true by giving a counterexample. 21.1-7 Argue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be nonpositive. 21.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim 591 21.1-8 Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G, and let L be the sorted list of the edge weights of T . Show that for any other minimum spanning tree T 0 of G, the list L is also the sorted list of edge weights of T 0 . 21.1-9 Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a graph G D .V; E/, and let V 0 be a subset of V . Let T 0 be the subgraph of T induced by V 0 , and let G 0 be the subgraph of G induced by V 0 . Show that if T 0 is connected, then T 0 is a minimum spanning tree of G 0 . 21.1-10 Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T , suppose that the weight of one of the edges in T decreases. Show that T is still a minimum spanning tree for G. More formally, let T be a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights given by weight function w. Choose one edge .x; y/ 2 T and a positive number k, and deûne the weight function w 0 by w 0 .u; v/ D ( w.u; v/ if .u; v/ ¤ .x; y/ ; w.x; y/  k if .u; v/ D .x; y/ : Show that T is a minimum spanning tree for G with edge weights given by w 0 . ? 21.1-11 Given a graph G and a minimum spanning tree T , suppose that the weight of one of the edges not in T decreases. Give an algorithm for ûnding the minimum spanning tree in the modiûed graph. 21.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim The two minimum-spanning-tree algorithms described in this section elaborate on the generic method. They each use a speciûc rule to determine a safe edge in line 3 of GENERIC-MST. In Kruskal9s algorithm, the set A is a forest whose vertices are all those of the given graph. The safe edge added to A is always a lowest-weight edge in the graph that connects two distinct components. In Prim9s algorithm, the set A forms a single tree. The safe edge added to A is always a lowest-weight edge connecting the tree to a vertex not in the tree. Both algorithms assume that the input graph is connected and represented by adjacency lists. 592 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (g) (f) (h) b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 Figure 21.4 The execution of Kruskal9s algorithm on the graph from Figure 21.1. Blue edges belong to the forest A being grown. The algorithm considers each edge in sorted order by weight. A red arrow points to the edge under consideration at each step of the algorithm. If the edge joins two distinct trees in the forest, it is added to the forest, thereby merging the two trees. Kruskal’s algorithm Kruskal9s algorithm ûnds a safe edge to add to the growing forest by ûnding, of all the edges that connect any two trees in the forest, an edge .u; v/ with the lowest weight. Let C 1 and C 2 denote the two trees that are connected by .u; v/. Since .u; v/ must be a light edge connecting C 1 to some other tree, Corollary 21.2 implies 21.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim 593 (i) (j) (k) (l) (n) (m) b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 2 Figure 21.4, continued Further steps in the execution of Kruskal9s algorithm. that .u; v/ is a safe edge for C 1 . Kruskal9s algorithm qualiûes as a greedy algorithm because at each step it adds to the forest an edge with the lowest possible weight. Like the algorithm to compute connected components from Section 19.1, the procedure MST-KRUSKAL on the following page uses a disjoint-set data structure to maintain several disjoint sets of elements. Each set contains the vertices in one tree of the current forest. The operation FIND-SET.u/ returns a representative element from the set that contains u. Thus, to determine whether two vertices u and v belong to the same tree, just test whether FIND-SET.u/ equals FIND-SET.v/. To combine trees, Kruskal9s algorithm calls the UNION procedure. Figure 21.4 shows how Kruskal9s algorithm works. Lines 133 initialize the set A to the empty set and create jV j trees, one containing each vertex. The for loop in lines 639 examines edges in order of weight, from lowest to highest. The loop checks, for each edge .u; v/, whether the endpoints u and v belong to the same tree. If they do, then the edge .u; v/ cannot be added to the forest without creating a cycle, and the edge is ignored.

The running time of Kruskal9s algorithm for a graph G D .V; E/ depends on the speciûc implementation of the disjoint-set data structure. Let9s assume that it uses the disjoint-set-forest implementation of Section 19.3 with the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics, since that is the asymptotically fastest implementa- tion known. Initializing the set A in line 1 takes O.1/ time, creating a single list of edges in line 4 takes O.V C E/ time (which is O.E/ because G is connected), and the time to sort the edges in line 5 is O.E lg E/. (We9ll account for the cost of the jV j MAKE-SET operations in the for loop of lines 233 in a moment.) The for loop of lines 639 performs O.E/ FIND-SET and UNION operations on the disjoint-set forest. Along with the jV j MAKE-SET operations, these disjoint-set operations take a total of O..V C E/ ˛.V // time, where ˛ is the very slowly growing func- tion deûned in Section 19.4. Because we assume that G is connected, we have jEj  jV j  1, and so the disjoint-set operations take O.E ˛.V // time. Moreover, since ˛.jV j/ D O.lg V / D O.lg E/, the total running time of Kruskal9s algorithm is O.E lg E/. Observing that jEj < jV j 2 , we have lg jEj D O.lg V /, and so we can restate the running time of Kruskal9s algorithm as O.E lg V /. Prim’s algorithm Like Kruskal9s algorithm, Prim9s algorithm is a special case of the generic min- imum-spanning-tree method from Section 21.1. Prim9s algorithm operates much like Dijkstra9s algorithm for ûnding shortest paths in a graph, which we9ll see in Section 22.3. Prim9s algorithm has the property that the edges in the set A always form a single tree. As Figure 21.5 shows, the tree starts from an arbitrary root vertex r and grows until it spans all the vertices in V . Each step adds to the tree A 21.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim 595 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 2 7 6 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 b a h c g i d f e 4 8 11 8 7 9 10 14 4 2 1 7 6 2 Figure 21.5 The execution of Prim9s algorithm on the graph from Figure 21.1. The root vertex is a. Blue vertices and edges belong to the tree being grown, and tan vertices have yet to be added to the tree. At each step of the algorithm, the vertices in the tree determine a cut of the graph, and a light edge crossing the cut is added to the tree. The edge and vertex added to the tree are highlighted in orange. In the second step (part (c)), for example, the algorithm has a choice of adding either edge .b; c/ or edge .a; h/ to the tree since both are light edges crossing the cut. 596 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees a light edge that connects A to an isolated vertex4one on which no edge of A is incident. By Corollary 21.2, this rule adds only edges that are safe for A. There- fore, when the algorithm terminates, the edges in A form a minimum spanning tree. This strategy qualiûes as greedy since at each step it adds to the tree an edge that contributes the minimum amount possible to the tree9s weight. In the procedure MST-PRIM below, the connected graph G and the root r of the minimum spanning tree to be grown are inputs to the algorithm. In order to efû- ciently select a new edge to add into tree A, the algorithm maintains a min-priority queue Q of all vertices that are not in the tree, based on a key attribute. For each vertex v, the attribute v: key is the minimum weight of any edge connecting v to a vertex in the tree, where by convention, v: key D 1 if there is no such edge. The attribute v:� names the parent of v in the tree. The algorithm implicitly maintains the set A from GENERIC-MST as A D f.v; v:�/ W v 2 V  fr g  Qg ; where we interpret the vertices in Q as forming a set. When the algorithm termi- nates, the min-priority queue Q is empty, and thus the minimum spanning tree A for G is A D f.v; v:�/ W v 2 V  fr gg : MST-PRIM.G; w; r/ 1 for each vertex u 2 G: V 2 u: key D 1 3 u:� D NIL 4 r: key D 0 5 Q D ; 6 for each vertex u 2 G: V 7 I NSERT .Q; u/ 8 while Q ¤ ; 9 u D EXTRACT-MIN.Q/ // add u to the tree 10 for each vertex v in G: AdjŒu� // update keys of u9s non-tree neighbors 11 if v 2 Q and w.u; v/ < v: key 12 v:� D u 13 v: key D w.u; v/ 14 DECREASE-KEY .Q; v; w.u; v// Figure 21.5 shows how Prim9s algorithm works. Lines 137 set the key of each vertex to 1 (except for the root r , whose key is set to 0 to make it the ûrst vertex processed), set the parent of each vertex to NIL, and insert each vertex into the min- priority queue Q. The algorithm maintains the following three-part loop invariant: 21.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim 597 Prior to each iteration of the while loop of lines 8314, 1. A D f.v; v:�/ W v 2 V  fr g  Qg. 2. The vertices already placed into the minimum spanning tree are those in V  Q. 3. For all vertices v 2 Q, if v:� ¤ NIL, then v: key < 1 and v: key is the weight of a light edge .v; v:�/ connecting v to some vertex already placed into the minimum spanning tree. Line 9 identiûes a vertex u 2 Q incident on a light edge that crosses the cut .V  Q; Q/ (with the exception of the ûrst iteration, in which u D r due to lines 437). Removing u from the set Q adds it to the set V  Q of vertices in the tree, thus adding the edge .u; u:�/ to A. The for loop of lines 10314 updates the key and � attributes of every vertex v adjacent to u but not in the tree, thereby maintaining the third part of the loop invariant. Whenever line 13 updates v: key, line 14 calls DECREASE-KEY to inform the min-priority queue that v9s key has changed. The running time of Prim9s algorithm depends on the speciûc implementation of the min-priority queue Q. You can implement Q with a binary min-heap (see Chapter 6), including a way to map between vertices and their corresponding heap elements. The BUILD-MIN-HEAP procedure can perform lines 537 in O.V / time. In fact, there is no need to call BUILD-MIN-HEAP. You can just put the key of r at the root of the min-heap, and because all other keys are 1, they can go anywhere else in the min-heap. The body of the while loop executes jV j times, and since each EXTRACT-MIN operation takes O.lg V / time, the total time for all calls to EXTRACT-MIN is O.V lg V /. The for loop in lines 10314 executes O.E/ times altogether, since the sum of the lengths of all adjacency lists is 2 jEj. Within the for loop, the test for membership in Q in line 11 can take constant time if you keep a bit for each vertex that indicates whether it belongs to Q and update the bit when the vertex is removed from Q. Each call to DECREASE- KEY in line 14 takes O.lg V / time. Thus, the total time for Prim9s algorithm is O.V lg V C E lg V / D O.E lg V /, which is asymptotically the same as for our implementation of Kruskal9s algorithm. You can further improve the asymptotic running time of Prim9 s algorithm by implementing the min-priority queue with a Fibonacci heap (see page 478). If a Fibonacci heap holds jV j elements, an EXTRACT-MIN operation takes O.lg V / amortized time and each I NSERT and DECREASE-KEY operation takes only O.1/ amortized time. Therefore, by using a Fibonacci heap to implement the min- priority queue Q, the running time of Prim9s algorithm improves to O.E CV lg V /. 598 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees Exercises 21.2-1 Kruskal9s algorithm can return different spanning trees for the same input graph G, depending on how it breaks ties when the edges are sorted. Show that for each minimum spanning tree T of G, there is a way to sort the edges of G in Kruskal9s algorithm so that the algorithm returns T . 21.2-2 Give a simple implementation of Prim9s algorithm that runs in O.V 2 / time when the graph G D .V; E/ is represented as an adjacency matrix. 21.2-3 For a sparse graph G D .V; E/, where jEj D ‚.V /, is the implementation of Prim9s algorithm with a Fibonacci heap asymptotically faster than the binary-heap implementation? What about for a dense graph, where jEj D ‚.V 2 /? How must the sizes jEj and jV j be related for the Fibonacci-heap implementation to be asymptotically faster than the binary-heap implementation? 21.2-4 Suppose that all edge weights in a graph are integers in the range from 1 to jV j. How fast can you make Kruskal9s algorithm run? What if the edge weights are integers in the range from 1 to W for some constant W ? 21.2-5 Suppose that all edge weights in a graph are integers in the range from 1 to jV j. How fast can you make Prim9s algorithm run? What if the edge weights are integers in the range from 1 to W for some constant W ? 21.2-6 Professor Borden proposes a new divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees, which goes as follows. Given a graph G D .V; E/, partition the set V of vertices into two sets V 1 and V 2 such that jV 1 j and jV 2 j differ by at most 1. Let E 1 be the set of edges that are incident only on vertices in V 1 , and let E 2 be the set of edges that are incident only on vertices in V 2 . Recursively solve a minimum-spanning-tree problem on each of the two subgraphs G 1 D .V 1 ; E 1 / and G 2 D .V 2 ; E 2 /. Finally, select the minimum-weight edge in E that crosses the cut .V 1 ; V 2 /, and use this edge to unite the resulting two minimum spanning trees into a single spanning tree. Either argue that the algorithm correctly computes a minimum spanning tree of G, or provide an example for which the algorithm fails. Problems for Chapter 21 599 ? 21.2-7 Suppose that the edge weights in a graph are uniformly distributed over the half- open interval Œ0; 1/.

How quickly can you update the minimum spanning tree upon adding a new vertex and incident edges to G? Problems 21-1 Second-best minimum spanning tree Let G D .V; E/ be an undirected, connected graph whose weight function is w W E ! R, and suppose that jEj  jV j and all edge weights are distinct. We deûne a second-best minimum spanning tree as follows. Let T be the set of all spanning trees of G, and let T be a minimum spanning tree of G. Then a second-best minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree T 0 such that w.T 0 / D min fw.T 00 / W T 00 2 T  fT gg. a. Show that the minimum spanning tree is unique, but that the second-best mini- mum spanning tree need not be unique. b. Let T be the minimum spanning tree of G. Prove that G contains some edge .u; v/ 2 T and some edge .x; y/ … T such that .T  f.u; v/g/ [ f.x; y/g is a second-best minimum spanning tree of G. c. Now let T be any spanning tree of G and, for any two vertices u; v 2 V , let maxŒu; v� denote an edge of maximum weight on the unique simple path between u and v in T . Describe an O.V 2 /-time algorithm that, given T , com- putes maxŒu; v� for all u; v 2 V . d. Give an efûcient algorithm to compute the second-best minimum spanning tree of G. 21-2 Minimum spanning tree in sparse graphs For a very sparse connected graph G D .V; E/, it is possible to further improve upon the O.E C V lg V / running time of Prim9s algorithm with a Fibonacci heap by preprocessing G to decrease the number of vertices before running Prim9s al- gorithm. In particular, for each vertex u, choose the minimum-weight edge .u; v/ 600 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees incident on u, and put .u; v/ into the minimum spanning tree under construction. Then, contract all chosen edges (see Section B.4). Rather than contracting these edges one at a time, ûrst identify sets of vertices that are united into the same new vertex. Then create the graph that would have resulted from contracting these edges one at a time, but do so by <renaming= edges according to the sets into which their endpoints were placed. Several edges from the original graph might be renamed the same as each other. In such a case, only one edge results, and its weight is the minimum of the weights of the corresponding original edges. Initially, set the minimum spanning tree T being constructed to be empty, and for each edge .u; v/ 2 E, initialize the two attributes .u; v/: orig D .u; v/ and .u; v/: c D w.u; v/. Use the orig attribute to reference the edge from the initial graph that is associated with an edge in the contracted graph. The c attribute holds the weight of an edge, and as edges are contracted, it is updated according to the above scheme for choosing edge weights. The procedure MST-R EDUCE on the facing page takes inputs G and T , and it returns a contracted graph G 0 with up- dated attributes orig 0 and c 0 . The procedure also accumulates edges of G into the minimum spanning tree T . a. Let T be the set of edges returned by MST-REDUCE, and let A be the minimum spanning tree of the graph G 0 formed by the call MST-PRIM.G 0 ; c 0 ; r/, where c 0 is the weight attribute on the edges of G 0 : E and r is any vertex in G 0 : V . Prove that T [ f.x; y/: orig 0 W .x; y/ 2 Ag is a minimum spanning tree of G. b. Argue that jG 0 : V j හ jV j =2. c. Show how to implement MST-REDUCE so that it runs in O.E/ time. (Hint: Use simple data structures.) d. Suppose that you run k phases of MST-REDUCE, using the output G 0 produced by one phase as the input G to the next phase and accumulating edges in T . Argue that the overall running time of the k phases is O.kE/. e. Suppose that after running k phases of MST-REDUCE, as in part (d), you run Prim9s algorithm by calling MST-PRIM.G 0 ; c 0 ; r/, where G 0 , with weight at- tribute c 0 , is returned by the last phase and r is any vertex in G 0 : V . Show how to pick k so that the overall running time is O.E lg lg V /. Argue that your choice of k minimizes the overall asymptotic running time. f.

Each one takes a connected graph and a w eight function as input and returns a set of edges T . For each algorithm, either prove that T is a minimum spanning tree or prove that T is not necessarily a minimum spanning tree. Also describe the most efûcient implementation of each algorithm, regardless of whether it computes a minimum spanning tree. 21-4 Bottleneck spanning tree A bottleneck spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a spanning tree of G whose largest edge weight is minimum over all spanning trees of G. The value of the bottleneck spanning tree is the weight of the maximum-weight edge in T . 602 Chapter 21 Minimum Spanning Trees MAYBE-MST-A .G; w/ 1 sort the edges into monotonically decreasing order of edge weights w 2 T D E 3 for each edge e, taken in monotonically decreasing order by weight 4 if T  feg is a connected graph 5 T D T  feg 6 return T MAYBE-MST-B .G; w/ 1 T D ; 2 for each edge e, taken in arbitrary order 3 if T [ feg has no cycles 4 T D T [ feg 5 return T MAYBE-MST-C .G; w/ 1 T D ; 2 for each edge e, taken in arbitrary order 3 T D T [ feg 4 if T has a cycle c 5 let e 0 be a maximum-weight edge on c 6 T D T  fe 0 g 7 return T a. Argue that a minimum spanning tree is a bottleneck spanning tree. Part (a) shows that ûnding a bottleneck spanning tree is no harder than ûnding a minimum spanning tree. In the remaining parts, you will show how to ûnd a bottleneck spanning tree in linear time. b. Give a linear-time algorithm that, given a graph G and an integer b, determines whether the value of the bottleneck spanning tree is at most b. c. Use your algorithm for part (b) as a subroutine in a linear-time algorithm for the bottleneck-spanning-tree problem. (Hint: You might want to use a subroutine that contracts sets of edges, as in the MST-R EDUCE procedure described in Problem 21-2.) Notes for Chapter 21 603 Chapter notes Tarjan [429] surveys the minimum-spanning-tree problem and provides excellent advanced material. Graham and Hell [198] compiled a history of the minimum- spanning-tree problem. Tarjan attributes the ûrst minimum-spanning-tree algorithm to a 1926 paper by O. Bor˚ uvka. Bor˚ uvka9s algorithm consists of running O.lg V / iterations of the procedure MST-REDUCE described in Problem 21-2. Kruskal9s algorithm was reported by Kruskal [272] in 1956. The algorithm commonly known as Prim9s algorithm was indeed invented by Prim [367], but it was also invented earlier by V. Jarn´ ık in 1930. When jEj D �.V lg V /, Prim9s algorithm, implemented with a Fibonacci heap, runs in O.E/ time. For sparser graphs, using a combination of the ideas from Prim9s algorithm, Kruskal9s algorithm, and Bor˚ uvka9s algorithm, together with ad- vanced data structures, Fredman and Tarjan [156] give an algorithm that runs in O.E lg  V / time. Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan [165] improved this algo- rithm to run in O.E lg lg  V / time. Chazelle [83] gives an algorithm that runs in O.E y ˛.E; V // time, where y ˛.E; V / is the functional inverse of Ackermann9s function. (See the chapter notes for Chapter 19 for a brief discussion of Acker- mann9s function and its inverse.) Unlike previous minimum-spanning-tree algo- rithms, Chazelle9s algorithm does not follow the greedy method. Pettie and Ra- machandran [356] give an algorithm based on precomputed <MST decision trees= that also runs in O.E y ˛.E; V // time. A related problem is spanning-tree veriûcation: given a graph G D .V; E/ and a tree T ෂ E, determine whether T is a minimum spanning tree of G. King [254] gives a linear-time algorithm to verify a spanning tree, building on earlier work of Koml´ os [269] and Dixon, Rauch, and Tarjan [120]. The above algorithms are all deterministic and fall into the comparison-based model described in Chapter 8. Karger, Klein, and Tarjan [243] give a randomized minimum-spanning-tree algorithm that runs in O.V C E/ expected time. This algorithm uses recursion in a manner similar to the linear-time selection algorithm in Section 9.3: a recursive call on an auxiliary problem identiûes a subset of the edges E 0 that cannot be in any minimum spanning tree. Another recursive call on E  E 0 then ûnds the minimum spanning tree. The algorithm also uses ideas from Bor˚ uvka9s algorithm and King9s algorithm for spanning-tree veriûcation. Fredman and Willard [158] showed how to ûnd a minimum spanning tree in O.V CE/ time using a deterministic algorithm that is not comparison based. Their algorithm assumes that the data are b-bit integers and that the computer memory consists of addressable b-bit words. 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Suppose that you need to drive from Oceanside, New York, to Oceanside, Califor- nia, by the shortest possible route. Your GPS contains information about the entire road network of the United States, including the road distance between each pair of adjacent intersections. How can your GPS determine this shortest route? One possible way is to enumerate all the routes from Oceanside, New York, to Oceanside, California, add up the distances on each route, and select the shortest. But even disallowing routes that contain cycles, your GPS would need to examine an enormous number of possibilities, most of which are simply not worth consid- ering. For example, a route that passes through Miami, Florida, is a poor choice, because Miami is several hundred miles out of the way. This chapter and Chapter 23 show how to solve such problems efûciently. The input to a shortest-paths problem is a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/, with a weight function w W E ! R mapping edges to real-valued weights. The weight w.p/ of path p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i is the sum of the weights of its con- stituent edges: w.p/ D k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / : We deûne the shortest-path weight ı.u; v/ from u to v by ı.u; v/ D ( minfw.p/ W u p ❀ vg if there is a path from u to v ; 1 otherwise : A shortest path from vertex u to vertex v is then deûned as any path p with weight w.p/ D ı.u; v/. In the example of going from Oceanside, New York, to Oceanside, California, your GPS models the road network as a graph: vertices represent intersections, edges represent road segments between intersections, and edge weights represent road distances. The goal is to ûnd a shortest path from a given intersection in Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths 605 Oceanside, New York (say, Brower Avenue and Skillman Avenue) to a given inter- section in Oceanside, California (say, Topeka Street and South Horne Street). Edge weights can represent metrics other than distances, such as time, cost, penalties, loss, or any other quantity that accumulates linearly along a path and that you want to minimize. The breadth-ûrst-search algorithm from Section 20.2 is a shortest-paths algo- rithm that works on unweighted graphs, that is, graphs in which each edge has unit weight. Because many of the concepts from breadth-ûrst search arise in the study of shortest paths in weighted graphs, you might want to review Section 20.2 before proceeding. Variants This chapter focuses on the single-source shortest-paths problem: given a graph G D .V; E/, ûnd a shortest path from a given source vertex s 2 V to every vertex v 2 V . The algorithm for the single-source problem can solve many other problems, including the following variants. Single-destination shortest-paths problem: Find a shortest path to a given des- tination vertex t from each vertex v. By reversing the direction of each edge in the graph, you can reduce this problem to a single-source problem. Single-pair shortest-path problem: Find a shortest path from u to v for given vertices u and v. If you solve the single-source problem with source vertex u, you solve this problem also. Moreover, all known algorithms for this problem have the same worst-case asymptotic running time as the best single-source algorithms. All-pairs shortest-paths problem: Find a shortest path from u to v for every pair of vertices u and v. Although you can solve this problem by running a single-source algorithm once from each vertex, you often can solve it faster. Additionally, its structure is interesting in its own right. Chapter 23 addresses the all-pairs problem in detail. Optimal substructure of a shortest path Shortest-paths algorithms typically rely on the property that a shortest path be- tween two vertices contains other shortest paths within it. (The Edmonds-Karp maximum-üow algorithm in Chapter 24 also relies on this property.) Recall that optimal substructure is one of the key indicators that dynamic programming (Chap- ter 14) and the greedy method (Chapter 15) might apply. Dijkstra9s algorithm, which we shall see in Section 22.3, is a greedy algorithm, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which ûnds a shortest path between every pair of vertices (see Sec- 606 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths tion 23.2), is a dynamic-programming algorithm. The following lemma states the optimal-substructure property of shortest paths more precisely. Lemma 22.1 (Subpaths of shortest paths are shortest paths) Given a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R, let p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i be a shortest path from vertex v 0 to vertex v k and, for any i and j such that 0 හ i හ j හ k, let p ij D hv i ; v i C1 ; : : : ; v j i be the subpath of p from vertex v i to vertex v j . Then, p ij is a shortest path from v i to v j . Proof Decompose path p into v 0 p 0i ❀ v i p ij ❀ v j p jk ❀ v k , so that w.p/ D w.p 0i / C w.p ij / C w.p jk /. Now, assume that there is a path p 0 ij from v i to v j with weight w.p 0 ij / < w.p ij /. Then, v 0 p 0i ❀ v i p 0 ij ❀ v j p jk ❀ v k is a path from v 0 to v k whose weight w.p 0i / C w.p 0 ij / C w.p jk / is less than w.p/, which contradicts the as- sumption that p is a shortest path from v 0 to v k . Negative-weight edges Some instances of the single-source shortest-paths problem may include edges whose weights are negative. If the graph G D .V; E/ contains no negative- weight cycles reachable from the source s , then for all v 2 V , the shortest-path weight ı.s; v/ remains well deûned, even if it has a negative value. If the graph contains a negative-weight cycle reachable from s , however, shortest-path weights are not well deûned. No path from s to a vertex on the cycle can be a short- est path4you can always ûnd a path with lower weight by following the proposed <shortest= path and then traversing the negative-weight cycle. If there is a negative- weight cycle on some path from s to v, we deûne ı.s; v/ D 1. Figure 22.1 illustrates the effect of negative weights and negative-weight cy- cles on shortest-path weights. Because there is only one path from s to a (the path hs; ai), we have ı.s; a/ D w.s; a/ D 3. Similarly, there is only one path from s to b, and so ı.s; b/ D w.s; a/ C w.a; b/ D 3 C .4/ D 1. There are inûnitely many paths from s to c : hs; c i, hs; c; d; c i, hs; c; d; c; d; c i, and so on. Because the cycle hc; d; c i has weight 6 C .3/ D 3 > 0, the shortest path from s to c is hs; c i, with weight ı.s; c/ D w.s; c/ D 5, and the shortest path from s to d is hs; c; d i, with weight ı.s; d / D w.s; c/ C w.c; d / D 11. Analogously, there are inûnitely many paths from s to e: hs; ei, hs; e; f; ei, hs; e; f; e; f; ei, and so on.

The shortest-path weight from source s appears within each vertex. Because vertices e and f form a negative-weight cycle reachable from s , they have shortest-path weights of 1. Because vertex g is reachable from a vertex whose shortest- path weight is 1, it, too, has a shortest-path weight of 1. Vertices such as h, i , and j are not reachable from s , and so their shortest-path weights are 1, even though they lie on a negative-weight cycle. and so ı.s; g/ D 1. Vertices h, i , and j also form a negative-weight cycle. They are not reachable from s , however, and so ı.s; h/ D ı.s; i / D ı.s; j / D 1. Some shortest-paths algorithms, such as Dijkstra9s algorithm, assume that all edge weights in the input graph are nonnegative, as in a road network. Others, such as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, allow negative-weight edges in the input graph and produce a correct answer as long as no negative-weight cycles are reachable from the source. Typically, if there is such a negative-weight cycle, the algorithm can detect and report its existence. Cycles Can a shortest path contain a cycle? As we have just seen, it cannot contain a negative-weight cycle. Nor can it contain a positive-weight cycle, since remov- ing the cycle from the path produces a path with the same source and destination vertices and a lower path weight. That is, if p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i is a path and c D hv i ; v i C1 ; : : : ; v j i is a positive-weight cycle on this path (so that v i D v j and w.c/ > 0 ), then the path p 0 D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v i ; v j C1 ; v j C2 ; : : : ; v k i has weight w.p 0 / D w.p/  w.c/ < w.p/, and so p cannot be a shortest path from v 0 to v k . That leaves only 0-weight cycles. You can remove a 0-weight cycle from any path to produce another path whose weight is the same. Thus, if there is a shortest path from a source vertex s to a destination vertex v that contains a 0-weight cycle, then there is another shortest path from s to v without this cycle. As long as a shortest path has 0-weight cycles, you can repeatedly remove these cycles from the path until you have a shortest path that is cycle-free. Therefore, without loss of 608 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths generality, assume that shortest paths have no cycles, that is, they are simple paths. Since any acyclic path in a graph G D .V; E/ contains at most jV j distinct vertices, it also contains at most jV j  1 edges. Assume, therefore, that any shortest path contains at most jV j  1 edges. Representing shortest paths It is usually not enough to compute only shortest-path weights. Most applications of shortest paths need to know the vertices on shortest paths as well. For example, if your GPS told you the distance to your destination but not how to get there, it would not be terribly useful. We represent shortest paths similarly to how we represented breadth-ûrst trees in Section 20.2. Given a graph G D .V; E/, maintain for each vertex v 2 V a predecessor v:� that is either another vertex or NIL. The shortest- paths algorithms in this chapter set the � attributes so that the chain of predecessors originating at a vertex v runs backward along a shortest path from s to v. Thus, given a vertex v for which v:� ¤ NIL, the procedure PRINT-PATH.G; s; v/ from Section 20.2 prints a shortest path from s to v. In the midst of executing a shortest-paths algorithm, however, the � values might not indicate shortest paths. The predecessor subgraph G  D .V  ; E  / induced by the � values is deûned the same for single-source shortest paths as for breadth-ûrst search in equations (20.2) and (20.3) on page 561: V  D fv 2 V W v:� ¤ NILg [ fs g ; E  D f.v:�; v/ 2 E W v 2 V   fs gg : We9ll prove that the � values produced by the algorithms in this chapter have the property that at termination G  is a <shortest-paths tree=4informally, a rooted tree containing a shortest path from the source s to every vertex that is reachable from s . A shortest-paths tree is like the breadth-ûrst tree from Section 20.2, but it contains shortest paths from the source deûned in terms of edge weights instead of numbers of edges. To be precise, let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles reachable from the source vertex s 2 V , so that shortest paths are well deûned. A shortest-paths tree rooted at s is a directed subgraph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where V 0 ෂ V and E 0 ෂ E, such that 1. V 0 is the set of vertices reachable from s in G, 2. G 0 forms a rooted tree with root s , and 3. for all v 2 V 0 , the unique simple path from s to v in G 0 is a shortest path from s to v in G.

Shortest paths are not necessarily unique, and neither are shortest-paths trees. For example, Figure 22.2 shows a weighted, directed graph and two shortest-paths trees with the same root. Relaxation The algorithms in this chapter use the technique of relaxation. For each vertex v 2 V , the single-source shortest paths algorithms maintain an attribute v: d, which is an upper bound on the weight of a shortest path from source s to v. We call v: d a shortest-path estimate. To initialize the shortest-path estimates and predecessors, call the ‚.V /-time procedure I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE. After initialization, we have v:� D NIL for all v 2 V , s: d D 0 and v: d D 1 for v 2 V  fs g. I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/ 1 for each vertex v 2 G: V 2 v: d D 1 3 v:� D NIL 4 s: d D 0 The process of relaxing an edge .u; v/ consists of testing whether going through vertex u improves the shortest path to vertex v found so far and, if so, updating v: d and v:� . A relaxation step might decrease the value of the shortest-path esti- mate v: d and update v9s predecessor attribute v:� . The RELAX procedure on the following page performs a relaxation step on edge .u; v/ in O.1/ time. Figure 22.3 shows two examples of relaxing an edge, one in which a shortest-path estimate decreases and one in which no estimate changes. 610 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths u 5 9 2 u 5 7 2 (a) (b) u 5 6 2 u 5 6 2 v v v v RELAX.u; v; w/ RELAX.u; v; w/ Figure 22.3 Relaxing an edge .u; v/ with weight w.u; v/ D 2.

The algorithms in this chapter differ in how many times they relax each edge and the order in which they relax edges. Dijk- stra9s algorithm and the shortest-paths algorithm for directed acyclic graphs relax each edge exactly once. The Bellman-Ford algorithm relaxes each edge jV j  1 times. Properties of shortest paths and relaxation To prove the algorithms in this chapter correct, we9ll appeal to several properties of shortest paths and relaxation. We state these properties here, and Section 22.5 proves them formally. For your reference, each property stated here includes the appropriate lemma or corollary number from Section 22.5. The latter ûve of these properties, which refer to shortest-path estimates or the predecessor subgraph, im- 1 It may seem strange that the term <relaxation= is used for an operation that tightens an upper bound. The use of the term is historical. The outcome of a relaxation step can be viewed as a relaxation of the constraint v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/, which, by the triangle inequality (Lemma 22.10 on page 633) , must be satisûed if u: d D ı.s; u/ and v: d D ı.s; v/. That is, if v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/, there is no <pressure= to satisfy this constraint, so the constraint is <relaxed.= Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths 611 plicitly assume that the graph is initialized with a call to I NITIALIZE-SINGLE- SOURCE.G; s/ and that the only way that shortest-path estimates and the prede- cessor subgraph change are by some sequence of relaxation steps. Triangle inequality (Lemma 22.10) For any edge .u; v/ 2 E, we have ı.s; v/ හ ı.s; u/ C w.u; v/. Upper-bound property (Lemma 22.11) We always have v: d  ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V , and once v: d achieves the value ı.s; v/, it never changes. No-path property (Corollary 22.12) If there is no path from s to v, then we always have v: d D ı.s; v/ D 1. Convergence property (Lemma 22.14) If s ❀ u ! v is a shortest path in G for some u; v 2 V , and if u: d D ı.s; u/ at any time prior to relaxing edge .u; v/, then v: d D ı.s; v/ at all times afterward. Path-relaxation property (Lemma 22.15) If p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i is a shortest path from s D v 0 to v k , and the edges of p are relaxed in the order .v 0 ; v 1 /; .v 1 ; v 2 /; : : : ; .v k1 ; v k /, then v k : d D ı.s; v k /. This property holds regardless of any other relaxation steps that occur, even if they are intermixed with relaxations of the edges of p. Predecessor-subgraph property (Lemma 22.17) Once v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V , the predecessor subgraph is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s . Chapter outline Section 22.1 presents the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which solves the single-source shortest-paths problem in the general case in which edges can have negative weight. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is remarkably simple, and it has the further beneût of detecting whether a negative-weight cycle is reachable from the source. Sec- tion 22.2 gives a linear-time algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source in a directed acyclic graph. Section 22.3 covers Dijkstra9s algorithm, which has a lower running time than the Bellman-Ford algorithm but requires the edge weights to be nonnegative. Section 22.4 shows how to use the Bellman-Ford algo- rithm to solve a special case of linear programming. Finally , Section 22.5 proves the properties of shortest paths and relaxation stated above. This chapter does arithmetic with inûnities, and so we need some conventions for when 1 or 1 appears in an arithmetic expression. We assume that for any real number a ¤ 1, we have a C 1 D 1 C a D 1. Also, to make our proofs hold in the presence of negative-weight cycles, we assume that for any real number a ¤ 1, we have a C .1/ D .1/ C a D 1. 612 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths All algorithms in this chapter assume that the directed graph G is stored in the adjacency-list representation. Additionally, stored with each edge is its weight, so that as each algorithm traverses an adjacency list, it can ûnd edge weights in O.1/ time per edge. 22.1 The Bellman-Ford algorithm The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem in the general case in which edge weights may be negative. Given a weighted, di- rected graph G D .V; E/ with source vertex s and weight function w W E ! R, the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns a boolean value indicating whether there is a negative-weight cycle that is reachable from the source. If there is such a cycle, the algorithm indicates that no solution exists. If there is no such cycle, the algorithm produces the shortest paths and their weights. The procedure BELLMAN-FORD relaxes edges, progressively decreasing an es- timate v: d on the weight of a shortest path from the source s to each vertex v 2 V until it achieves the actual shortest-path weight ı.s; v/. The algorithm returns TRUE if and only if the graph contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from the source.

After initializing the d and � values of all vertices in line 1, the algorithm makes jV j  1 passes over the edges of the graph. Each pass is one iteration of the for loop of lines 234 and consists of relaxing each edge of the graph once. Figures 22.4(b)3(e) show the state of the algorithm after each of the four passes over the edges. After making jV j  1 passes, lines 538 check for a negative-weight cycle and return the appropriate boolean value.

Vertices whose shortest-path estimates and predecessors have changed due to a pass are highlighted in orange. The d and � values in part (e) are the ûnal values. The Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE in this example. The Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in O.V 2 C VE/ time when the graph is rep- resented by adjacency lists, since the initialization in line 1 takes ‚.V / time, each of the jV j  1 passes over the edges in lines 234 takes ‚.V C E/ time (examin- ing jV j adjacency lists to ûnd the jEj edges), and the for loop of lines 537 takes O.V C E/ time. Fewer than jV j  1 passes over the edges sometimes sufûce (see Exercise 22.1-3), which is why we say O.V 2 C VE/ time, rather than ‚.V 2 C VE/ time. In the frequent case where jEj D �.V / , we can express this running time as O.VE/. Exercise 22.1-5 asks you to make the Bellman-Ford algorithm run in O.VE/ time even when jEj D o.V /. To prove the correctness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, we start by showing that if there are no negative-weight cycles, the algorithm computes correct shortest-path weights for all vertices reachable from the source. 614 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Lemma 22.2 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex s and weight function w W E ! R, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from s . Then, after the jV j  1 iterations of the for loop of lines 234 of BELLMAN-FORD, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v that are reachable from s . Proof We prove the lemma by appealing to the path-relaxation property. Con- sider any vertex v that is reachable from s , and let p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 0 D s and v k D v, be any shortest path from s to v. Because shortest paths are simple, p has at most jV j  1 edges, and so k හ jV j  1. Each of the jV j  1 itera- tions of the for loop of lines 234 relaxes all jEj edges. Among the edges relaxed in the i th iteration, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, is .v i 1 ; v i /. By the path-relaxation property, therefore, v: d D v k : d D ı.s; v k / D ı.s; v/. Corollary 22.3 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex s and weight function w W E ! R. Then, for each vertex v 2 V , there is a path from s to v if and only if BELLMAN-FORD terminates with v: d < 1 when it is run on G. Proof The proof is left as Exercise 22.1-2. Theorem 22.4 (Correctness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm) Let BELLMAN-FORD be run on a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with source vertex s and weight function w W E ! R. If G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from s , then the algorithm returns TRUE, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V , and the predecessor subgraph G  is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s . If G does contain a negative-weight cycle reachable from s , then the algorithm returns FALSE. Proof Suppose that graph G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reach- able from the source s . We ûrst prove the claim that at termination, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V . If vertex v is reachable from s , then Lemma 22.2 proves this claim. If v is not reachable from s , then the claim follows from the no-path prop- erty. Thus, the claim is proven. The predecessor-subgraph property, along with the claim, implies that G  is a shortest-paths tree. Now we use the claim to show that BELLMAN-FORD returns TRUE. At termination, for all edges .u; v/ 2 E we have v: d D ı.s; v/ හ ı.s; u/ C w.u; v/ (by the triangle inequality) D u: d C w.u; v/ ; 22.1 The Bellman-Ford algorithm 615 and so none of the tests in line 6 causes BELLMAN-FORD to return FALSE. There- fore, it returns TRUE. Now, suppose that graph G contains a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source s . Let this cycle be c D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 0 D v k , in which case we have k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / < 0 : (22.1) Assume for the purpose of contradiction that the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE. Thus, v i : d හ v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i / for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Summing the inequalities around cycle c gives k X i D1 v i : d හ k X i D1 .v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i // D k X i D1 v i 1 : d C k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / : Since v 0 D v k , each vertex in c appears exactly once in each of the summations P k i D1 v i : d and P k i D1 v i 1 : d, and so k X i D1 v i : d D k X i D1 v i 1 : d : Moreover, by Corollary 22.3, v i : d is ûnite for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Thus, 0 හ k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / ; which contradicts inequality (22.1). We conclude that the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE if graph G contains no negative-weight cycles reachable from the source, and FALSE otherwise. Exercises 22.1-1 Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 22.4, using ver- tex ´ as the source. In each pass, relax edges in the same order as in the ûgure, and show the d and � values after each pass. Now, change the weight of edge .´; x/ to 4 and run the algorithm again, using s as the source. 22.1-2 Prove Corollary 22.3. 616 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths 22.1-3 Given a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with no negative-weight cycles, let m be the maximum over all vertices v 2 V of the minimum number of edges in a shortest path from the source s to v. (Here, the shortest path is by weight, not the number of edges.) Suggest a simple change to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that allows it to terminate in m C 1 passes, even if m is not known in advance. 22.1-4 Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it sets v: d to 1 for all vertices v for which there is a negative-weight cycle on some path from the source to v. 22.1-5 Suppose that the graph given as input to the Bellman-Ford algorithm is represented with a list of jEj edges, where each edge indicates the vertices it leaves and enters, along with its weight. Argue that the Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in O.VE/ time without the constraint that jEj D �.V / . Modify the Bellman-Ford algorithm so that it runs in O.VE/ time in all cases when the input graph is represented with adjacency lists. 22.1-6 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E !

Give an O.VE/-time algorithm to ûnd, for all vertices v 2 V , the value ı  .v/ D min fı.u; v/ W u 2 V g. 22.1-7 Suppose that a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ contains a negative-weight cycle. Give an efûcient algorithm to list the vertices of one such cycle. Prove that your algorithm is correct. 22.2 Single-source shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs In this section, we introduce one further restriction on weighted, directed graphs: they are acyclic. That is, we are concerned with weighted dags. Shortest paths are always well deûned in a dag, since even if there are negative-weight edges, no negative-weight cycles can exist. We9ll see that if the edges of a weighted dag G D .V; E/ are relaxed according to a topological sort of its vertices, it takes only ‚.V C E/ time to compute shortest paths from a single source. The algorithm starts by topologically sorting the dag (see Section 20.4) to im- pose a linear ordering on the vertices. If the dag contains a path from vertex u to vertex v, then u precedes v in the topological sort. The DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS 22.2 Single-source shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs 617 procedure makes just one pass over the vertices in the topologically sorted order. As it processes each vertex, it relaxes each edge that leaves the vertex. Figure 22.5 shows the execution of this algorithm. DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS .G; w; s/ 1 topologically sort the vertices of G 2 I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/ 3 for each vertex u 2 G: V , taken in topologically sorted order 4 for each vertex v in G: AdjŒu� 5 RELAX.u; v; w/ Let9s analyze the running time of this algorithm. As shown in Section 20.4, the topological sort of line 1 takes ‚.V C E/ time. The call of I NITIALIZE-SINGLE- SOURCE in line 2 takes ‚.V / time. The for loop of lines 335 makes one iteration per vertex. Altogether, the for loop of lines 435 relaxes each edge exactly once. (We have used an aggregate analysis here.) Because each iteration of the inner for loop takes ‚.1/ time, the total running time is ‚.V C E/, which is linear in the size of an adjacency-list representation of the graph. The following theorem shows that the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure cor- rectly computes the shortest paths. Theorem 22.5 If a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ has source vertex s and no cycles, then at the termination of the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V , and the predecessor subgraph G  is a shortest-paths tree. Proof We ûrst show that v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V at termination. If v is not reachable from s , then v: d D ı.s; v/ D 1 by the no-path property. Now, suppose that v is reachable from s , so that there is a shortest path p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 0 D s and v k D v. Because DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS processes the vertices in topologically sorted order, it relaxes the edges on p in the order .v 0 ; v 1 /; .v 1 ; v 2 /; : : : ; .v k1 ; v k /. The path-relaxation property implies that v i : d D ı.s; v i / at termination for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k. Finally, by the predecessor- subgraph property, G  is a shortest-paths tree. A useful application of this algorithm arises in determining critical paths in PERT chart 2 analysis. A job consists of several tasks. Each task takes a certain 2 <PERT= is an acronym for <program evaluation and review technique.= 618 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths 2 ∞ ∞ 0 5 1 6 3 4 ∞ ∞ ∞ 7 31 32 2 (a) x t s r y z 1 6 3 4 2 (c) x t s r y z 1 6 3 4 2 (e) x t s r y z 2 5 1 6 3 4 7 31 32 2 (g) x t s r y z 2 5 1 6 3 4 7 31 32 2 (b) x t s r y z 2 5 1 6 3 4 7 31 32 2 (d) x t s r y z 1 6 3 4 2 (f) x t s r y z ∞ ∞ 0 ∞ ∞ ∞ 2 5 7 31 32 ∞ ∞ ∞ 2 6 0 ∞ 0 6 6 4 2 2 5 7 31 –2 ∞ 0 2 6 5 4 2 5 7 31 –2 ∞ 0 2 6 5 3 ∞ 0 2 6 5 3 Figure 22.5 The execution of the algorithm for shortest paths in a directed acyclic graph.

For example, if the job is to build a house, then the foundation must be completed before starting to frame the exterior walls, which must be completed before starting on the roof. Some tasks require more than one other task to be completed before they can be started: before the drywall can be installed over the wall framing, both the electrical system and plumbing must be installed. A dag models the tasks and dependencies. Edges represent tasks, with the weight of an edge indicating the time required to perform the task. Vertices represent <milestones,= which are 22.2 Single-source shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs 619 achieved when all the tasks represented by the edges entering the vertex have been completed. If edge .u; v/ enters vertex v and edge .v; x/ leaves v, then task .u; v/ must be completed before task .v; x/ is started. A path through this dag represents a sequence of tasks that must be performed in a particular order. A critical path is a longest path through the dag, corresponding to the longest time to perform any sequence of tasks. Thus, the weight of a critical path provides a lower bound on the total time to perform all the tasks, even if as many tasks as possible are performed simultaneously. You can ûnd a critical path by either  negating the edge weights and running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS, or  running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS, but replacing <1= by <1= in line 2 of I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE and <>= by <<= in the RELAX procedure. Exercises 22.2-1 Show the result of running DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS on the directed acyclic graph of Figure 22.5, using vertex r as the source. 22.2-2 Suppose that you change line 3 of DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS to read 3 for the ûrst jV j  1 vertices, taken in topologically sorted order Show that the procedure remains correct. 22.2-3 An alternative way to represent a PERT chart looks more like the dag of Figure 20.7 on page 574. Vertices represent tasks and edges represent sequencing constraints, that is, edge .u; v/ indicates that task u must be performed before task v. Vertices, not edges, have weights. Modify the DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure so that it ûnds a longest path in a directed acyclic graph with weighted vertices in linear time. ? 22.2-4 Give an efûcient algorithm to count the total number of paths in a directed acyclic graph. The count should include all paths between all pairs of vertices and all paths with 0 edges. Analyze your algorithm. 620 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths 22.3 Dijkstra’s algorithm Dijkstra9s algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/, but it requires nonnegative weights on all edges: w.u; v/  0 for each edge .u; v/ 2 E. As we shall see, with a good implementa- tion, the running time of Dijkstra9s algorithm is lower than that of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. You can think of Dijkstra9s algorithm as generalizing breadth-ûrst search to weighted graphs. A wave emanates from the source, and the ûrst time that a wave arrives at a vertex, a new wave emanates from that vertex. Whereas breadth-ûrst search operates as if each wave takes unit time to traverse an edge, in a weighted graph, the time for a wave to traverse an edge is given by the edge9s weight. Be- cause a shortest path in a weighted graph might not have the fewest edges, a sim- ple, ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue won9t sufûce for choosing the next vertex from which to send out a wave. Instead, Dijkstra9s algorithm maintains a set S of vertices whose ûnal shortest- path weights from the source s have already been determined. The algorithm re- peatedly selects the vertex u 2 V  S with the minimum shortest-path estimate, adds u into S , and relaxes all edges leaving u. The procedure DIJKSTRA replaces the ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue of breadth-ûrst search by a min-priority queue Q of vertices, keyed by their d values.

The source s is the leftmost vertex. The shortest-path estimates appear within the vertices, and blue edges indicate predecessor values. Blue vertices belong to the set S , and tan vertices are in the min-priority queue Q D V  S . (a) The situation just before the ûrst iteration of the while loop of lines 6312. (b)–(f) The situation after each successive iteration of the while loop.

The d values and predecessors shown in part (f) are the ûnal values. of the while loop of lines 6312. Lines 335 initialize the min-priority queue Q to contain all the vertices in V . Since S D ; at that time, the invariant is true upon ûrst reaching line 6. Each time through the while loop of lines 6312, line 7 extracts a vertex u from Q D V  S and line 8 adds it to set S , thereby maintaining the invariant. (The ûrst time through this loop, u D s .) Vertex u, therefore, has the smallest shortest-path estimate of any vertex in V  S . Then, lines 9312 relax each edge .u; v/ leaving u, thus updating the estimate v: d and the predecessor v:� if the shortest path to v found so far improves by going through u. Whenever a relaxation step changes the d and � values, the call to DECREASE-KEY in line 12 updates the min-priority queue. The algorithm never inserts vertices into Q after the for loop of lines 435, and each vertex is extracted from Q and added to S exactly once, so that the while loop of lines 6312 iterates exactly jV j times. Because Dijkstra9s algorithm always chooses the <lightest= or <closest= vertex in V  S to add to set S , you can think of it as using a greedy strategy. Chap- ter 15 explains greedy strategies in detail, but you need not have read that chapter to understand Dijkstra9s algorithm. Greedy strategies do not always yield optimal 622 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths S u y s x Figure 22.7 The proof of Theorem 22.6. Vertex u is selected to be added into set S in line 7 of DIJKSTRA. Vertex y is the ûrst vertex on a shortest path from the source s to vertex u that is not in set S , and x 2 S is y9s predecessor on that shortest path. The subpath from y to u may or may not re-enter set S . results in general, but as the following theorem and its corollary show, Dijkstra9s al- gorithm does indeed compute shortest paths. The key is to show that u: d D ı.s; u/ each time it adds a vertex u to set S . Theorem 22.6 (Correctness of Dijkstra’s algorithm) Dijkstra9s algorithm, run on a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with nonneg- ative weight function w and source vertex s , terminates with u: d D ı.s; u/ for all vertices u 2 V . Proof We will show that at the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 6312, we have v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 S . The algorithm terminates when S D V , so that v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V . The proof is by induction on the number of iterations of the while loop, which equals jS j at the start of each iteration. There are two bases: for jS j D 0, so that S D ; and the claim is trivially true, and for jS j D 1, so that S D fs g and s: d D ı.s; s/ D 0. For the inductive step, the inductive hypothesis is that v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 S . The algorithm extracts vertex u from V  S . Because the algorithm adds u into S , we need to show that u: d D ı.s; u/ at that time. If there is no path from s to u, then we are done, by the no-path property. If there is a path from s to u, then, as Figure 22.7 shows, let y be the ûrst vertex on a shortest path from s to u that is not in S , and let x 2 S be the predecessor of y on that shortest path. (We could have y D u or x D s .) Because y appears no later than u on the shortest path and all edge weights are nonnegative, we have ı.s; y/ හ ı.s; u/. Because the call of EXTRACT-MIN in line 7 returned u as having the minimum d value in V  S , we also have u: d හ y: d, and the upper-bound property gives ı.s; u/ හ u: d. Since x 2 S , the inductive hypothesis implies that x: d D ı.s; x/. During the iteration of the while loop that added x into S , edge .x; y/ was relaxed. By the convergence property, y: d received the value of ı.s; y/ at that time. Thus, we have 22.3 Dijkstra’s algorithm 623 ı.s; y/ හ ı.s; u/ හ u: d හ y: d and y: d D ı.s; y/ ; so that ı.s; y/ D ı.s; u/ D u: d D y: d : Hence, u: d D ı.s; u/, and by the upper-bound property, this value never changes again. Corollary 22.7 After Dijkstra9s algorithm is run on a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with nonnegative weight function w and source vertex s , the predecessor subgraph G  is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s . Proof Immediate from Theorem 22.6 and the predecessor-subgraph property. Analysis How fast is Dijkstra9s algorithm? It maintains the min-priority queue Q by calling three priority-queue operations: I NSERT (in line 5), EXTRACT-MIN (in line 7), and DECREASE-KEY (in line 12). The algorithm calls both I NSERT and EXTRACT- MIN once per vertex. Because each vertex u 2 V is added to set S exactly once, each edge in the adjacency list AdjŒu� is examined in the for loop of lines 9312 exactly once during the course of the algorithm. Since the total number of edges in all the adjacency lists is jEj, this for loop iterates a total of jEj times, and thus the algorithm calls DECREASE-KEY at most jEj times overall. (Observe once again that we are using aggregate analysis.) Just as in Prim9s algorithm, the running time of Dijkstra9s algorithm depends on the speciûc implementation of the min-priority queue Q. A simple implementation takes advantage of the vertices being numbered 1 to jV j: simply store v: d in the vth entry of an array. Each I NSERT and DECREASE-KEY operation takes O.1/ time, and each EXTRACT-MIN operation takes O.V / time (since it has to search through the entire array), for a total time of O.V 2 C E/ D O.V 2 /. If the graph is sufûciently sparse4in particular, E D o.V 2 = lg V /4you can improve the running time by implementing the min-priority queue with a binary min-heap that includes a way to map between vertices and their corresponding heap elements. Each E XTRACT-MIN operation then takes O.lg V / time. As be- fore, there are jV j such operations. The time to build the binary min-heap is O.V /. (As noted in Section 21.2, you don9t even need to call BUILD-MIN-HEAP.) Each DECREASE-KEY operation takes O.lg V / time, and there are still at most jEj such operations. The total running time is therefore O..V C E/ lg V /, which is O.E lg V / in the typical case that jEj D �.V / . This running time improves upon the straightforward O.V 2 /-time implementation if E D o.V 2 = lg V /. 624 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths By implementing the min-priority queue with a Fibonacci heap (see page 478), you can improve the running time to O.V lg V C E/. The amortized cost of each of the jV j EXTRACT-MIN operations is O.lg V /, and each DECREASE-KEY call, of which there are at most jEj, takes only O.1/ amortized time. Historically, the development of Fibonacci heaps was motivated by the observation that Dijkstra9s algorithm typically makes many more DECREASE-KEY calls than EXTRACT-MIN calls, so that any method of reducing the amortized time of each D ECREASE-KEY operation to o.lg V / without increasing the amortized time of EXTRACT-MIN would yield an asymptotically faster implementation than with binary heaps. Dijkstra9s algorithm resembles both breadth-ûrst search (see Section 20.2) and Prim9s algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees (see Section 21.2). It is like breadth-ûrst search in that set S corresponds to the set of black vertices in a breadth-ûrst search. Just as vertices in S have their ûnal shortest-path weights, so do black vertices in a breadth-ûrst search have their correct breadth-ûrst distances. Dijkstra9s algorithm is like Prim9s algorithm in that both algorithms use a min- priority queue to ûnd the <lightest= vertex outside a given set (the set S in Dijkstra9s algorithm and the tree being grown in Prim9s algorithm), add this vertex into the set, and adjust the weights of the remaining vertices outside the set accordingly. Exercises 22.3-1 Run Dijkstra9s algorithm on the directed graph of Figure 22.2, ûrst using vertex s as the source and then using vertex ´ as the source. In the style of Figure 22.6, show the d and � values and the vertices in set S after each iteration of the while loop. 22.3-2 Give a simple example of a directed graph with negative-weight edges for which Dijkstra9s algorithm produces an incorrect answer. Why doesn9t the proof of The- orem 22.6 go through when negative-weight edges are allowed? 22.3-3 Suppose that you change line 6 of Dijkstra9s algorithm to read 6 while jQj > 1 This change causes the while loop to execute jV j  1 times instead of jV j times. Is this proposed algorithm correct? 22.3 Dijkstra’s algorithm 625 22.3-4 Modify the DIJKSTRA procedure so that the priority queue Q is more like the queue in the BFS procedure in that it contains only vertices that have been reached from source s so far: Q ෂ V  S and v 2 Q implies v: d ¤ 1. 22.3-5 Professor Gaedel has written a program that he claims implements Dijkstra9s al- gorithm. The program produces v: d and v:� for each vertex v 2 V . Give an O.V C E/-time algorithm to check the output of the professor9s program. It should determine whether the d and � attributes match those of some shortest-paths tree. You may assume that all edge weights are nonnegative. 22.3-6 Professor Newman thinks that he has worked out a simpler proof of correctness for Dijkstra9s algorithm. He claims that Dijkstra9s algorithm relaxes the edges of every shortest path in the graph in the order in which they appear on the path, and therefore the path-relaxation property applies to every vertex reachable from the source. Show that the professor is mistaken by constructing a directed graph for which Dijkstra9s algorithm relaxes the edges of a shortest path out of order. 22.3-7 Consider a directed graph G D .V; E/ on which each edge .u; v/ 2 E has an associated value r.u; v/, which is a real number in the range 0 හ r.u; v/ හ 1 that represents the reliability of a communication channel from vertex u to vertex v. Interpret r.u; v/ as the probability that the channel from u to v will not fail, and assume that these probabilities are independent. Give an efûcient algorithm to ûnd the most reliable path between two given vertices. 22.3-8 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with positive weight function w W E ! f1; 2; : : : ; W g for some positive integer W , and assume that no two ver- tices have the same shortest-path weights from source vertex s . Now deûne an unweighted, directed graph G 0 D .V [ V 0 ; E 0 / by replacing each edge .u; v/ 2 E with w.u; v/ unit-weight edges in series. How many vertices does G 0 have? Now suppose that you run a breadth-ûrst search on G 0 . Show that the order in which the breadth-ûrst search of G 0 colors vertices in V black is the same as the order in which Dijkstra9s algorithm extracts the vertices of V from the priority queue when it runs on G. 22.3-9 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with nonnegative weight function w W E ! f0; 1; : : : ; W g for some nonnegative integer W . Modify Dijkstra9s algo- 626 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths rithm to compute the shortest paths from a given source vertex s in O.W V C E/ time. 22.3-10 Modify your algorithm from Exercise 22.3-9 to run in O..V C E/ lg W / time. (Hint: How many distinct shortest-path estimates can V  S contain at any point in time?) 22.3-11 Suppose that you are given a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ in which edges that leave the source vertex s may have negative weights, all other edge weights are nonnegative, and there are no negative-weight cycles. Argue that Dijkstra9s algorithm correctly ûnds shortest paths from s in this graph. 22.3-12 Suppose that you have a weighted directed graph G D .V; E/ in which all edge weights are positive real values in the range ŒC; 2C � for some positive constant C . Modify Dijkstra9s algorithm so that it runs in O.V C E/ time. 22.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths Chapter 29 studies the general linear-programming problem, showing how to op- timize a linear function subject to a set of linear inequalities. This section in- vestigates a special case of linear programming that reduces to ûnding shortest paths from a single source. The Bellman-Ford algorithm then solves the resulting single-source shortest-paths problem, thereby also solving the linear-programming problem. Linear programming In the general linear-programming problem, the input is an m  n matrix A, an m-vector b, and an n-vector c . The goal is to ûnd a vector x of n elements that maximizes the objective function P n i D1 c i x i subject to the m constraints given by Ax හ b. The most popular method for solving linear programs is the simplex algorithm, which Section 29.1 discusses. Although the simplex algorithm does not always run in time polynomial in the size of its input, there are other linear-programming al- gorithms that do run in polynomial time. We offer here two reasons to understand the setup of linear-programming problems. First, if you know that you can cast a given problem as a polynomial-sized linear-programming problem, then you im- 22.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths 627 mediately have a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem. Second, faster algorithms exist for many special cases of linear programming. For example, the single-pair shortest-path problem (Exercise 22.4-4) and the maximum-üow prob- lem (Exercise 24.1-5) are special cases of linear programming. Sometimes the objective function does not matter: it9s enough just to ûnd any feasible solution, that is, any vector x that satisûes Ax හ b, or to determine that no feasible solution exists. This section focuses on one such feasibility problem. Systems of difference constraints In a system of difference constraints, each row of the linear-programming matrix A contains one 1 and one 1, and all other entries of A are 0. Thus, the constraints given by Ax හ b are a set of m difference constraints involving n unknowns, in which each constraint is a simple linear inequality of the form x j  x i හ b k ; where 1 හ i; j හ n, i ¤ j , and 1 හ k හ m. For example, consider the problem of ûnding a 5-vector x D .x i / that satisûes  1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 ˘ ˇ x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5  හ  0 1 1 5 4 1 3 3 ˘ : This problem is equivalent to ûnding values for the unknowns x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x 4 ; x 5 , satisfying the following 8 difference constraints: x 1  x 2 හ 0 , (22.2) x 1  x 5 හ 1 , (22.3) x 2  x 5 හ 1 , (22.4) x 3  x 1 හ 5 , (22.5) x 4  x 1 හ 4 , (22.6) x 4  x 3 හ 1 , (22.7) x 5  x 3 හ 3 , (22.8) x 5  x 4 හ 3 . (22.9) One solution to this problem is x D .5; 3; 0; 1; 4/, which you can verify di- rectly by checking each inequality. In fact, this problem has more than one solution. 628 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Another is x 0 D .0; 2; 5; 4; 1/. These two solutions are related: each component of x 0 is 5 larger than the corresponding component of x . This fact is not mere coincidence. Lemma 22.8 Let x D .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n / be a solution to a system Ax හ b of difference con- straints, and let d be any constant. Then x C d D .x 1 C d; x 2 C d; : : : ; x n C d / is a solution to Ax හ b as well. Proof For each x i and x j , we have .x j C d /  .x i C d / D x j  x i . Thus, if x satisûes Ax හ b, so does x C d . Systems of difference constraints occur in various applications. For example, the unknowns x i might be times at which events are to occur. Each constraint states that at least a certain amount of time, or at most a certain amount of time, must elapse between two events. Perhaps the events are jobs to be performed during the assembly of a product. If the manufacturer applies an adhesive that takes 2 hours to set at time x 1 and has to wait until it sets to install a part at time x 2 , then there is a constraint that x 2  x 1 C 2 or, equivalently, that x 1  x 2 හ 2. Alternatively, the manufacturer might require the part to be installed after the adhesive has been applied but no later than the time that the adhesive has set halfway. In this case, there is a pair of constraints x 2  x 1 and x 2 හ x 1 C 1 or, equivalently, x 1  x 2 හ 0 and x 2  x 1 හ 1. If all the constraints have nonnegative numbers on the right-hand side4that is, if b i  0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m4then ûnding a feasible solution is trivial: just set all the unknowns x i equal to each other. Then all the differences are 0, and every constraint is satisûed. The problem of ûnding a feasible solution to a system of difference constraints is interesting only if at least one constraint has b i < 0. Constraint graphs We can interpret systems of difference constraints from a graph-theoretic point of view. For a system Ax හ b of difference constraints, let9s view the m  n linear-programming matrix A as the transpose of an incidence matrix (see Exer- cise 20.1-7) for a graph with n vertices and m edges. Each vertex v i in the graph, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, corresponds to one of the n unknown variables x i . Each di- rected edge in the graph corresponds to one of the m inequalities involving two unknowns. More formally, given a system Ax හ b of difference constraints, the correspond- ing constraint graph is a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/, where 22.4 Difference constraints and shortest paths 629 0 0 0 0 0 0 31 1 5 4 31 33 33 0 35 33 0 31 34 v 5 v 0 v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 Figure 22.8 The constraint graph corresponding to the system (22.2)–(22.9) of difference con- straints. The value of ı.v 0 ; v i / appears in each vertex v i . One feasible solution to the system is x D .5; 3; 0; 1; 4/. V D fv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v n g and D f.v i ; v j / W x j  x i හ b k is a constraint g [ f.v 0 ; v 1 /; .v 0 ; v 2 /; .v 0 ; v 3 /; : : : ; .v 0 ; v n /g : The constraint graph includes the additional vertex v 0 , as we shall see shortly, to guarantee that the graph has some vertex that can reach all other vertices. Thus, the vertex set V consists of a vertex v i for each unknown x i , plus an additional vertex v 0 . The edge set E contains an edge for each difference constraint, plus an edge .v 0 ; v i / for each unknown x i . If x j  x i හ b k is a difference constraint, then the weight of edge .v i ; v j / is w.v i ; v j / D b k . The weight of each edge leav- ing v 0 is 0. Figure 22.8 shows the constraint graph for the system (22.2)–(22.9) of difference constraints. The following theorem shows how to solve a system of difference constraints by ûnding shortest-path weights in the corresponding constraint graph. Theorem 22.9 Given a system Ax හ b of difference constraints, let G D .V; E/ be the corre- sponding constraint graph. If G contains no negative-weight cycles, then x D .ı.v 0 ; v 1 /; ı.v 0 ; v 2 /; ı.v 0 ; v 3 /; : : : ; ı.v 0 ; v n // (22.10) is a feasible solution for the system. If G contains a negative-weight cycle, then there is no feasible solution for the system. 630 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Proof We ûrst show that if the constraint graph contains no negative-weight cycles, then equation (22.10) gives a feasible solution. Consider any edge .v i ; v j / 2 E. The triangle inequality implies that ı.v 0 ; v j / හ ı.v 0 ; v i / C w.v i ; v j /, which is equivalent to ı.v 0 ; v j /ı.v 0 ; v i / හ w.v i ; v j /. Thus, letting x i D ı.v 0 ; v i / and x j D ı.v 0 ; v j / satisûes the difference constraint x j  x i හ w.v i ; v j / that cor- responds to edge .v i ; v j /. Now we show that if the constraint graph contains a negative-weight cycle, then the system of difference constraints has no feasible solution. Without loss of gen- erality, let the negative-weight cycle be c D hv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 1 D v k . (The vertex v 0 cannot be on cycle c , because it has no entering edges.) Cycle c corresponds to the following difference constraints: x 2  x 1 හ w.v 1 ; v 2 / ; x 3  x 2 හ w.v 2 ; v 3 / ; : : : x k1  x k2 හ w.v k2 ; v k1 / ; x k  x k1 හ w.v k1 ; v k / : We9ll assume that x has a solution satisfying each of these k inequalities and then derive a contradiction. The solution must also satisfy the inequality that results from summing the k inequalities together. In summing the left-hand sides, each unknown x i is added in once and subtracted out once (remember that v 1 D v k implies x 1 D x k ), so that the left-hand side sums to 0. The right-hand side sums to the weight w.c/ of the cycle, giving 0 හ w.c/. But since c is a negative-weight cycle, w.c/ < 0, and we obtain the contradiction that 0 හ w.c/ < 0. Solving systems of difference constraints Theorem 22.9 suggests how to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve a system of difference constraints. Because the constraint graph contains edges from the source vertex v 0 to all other vertices, any negative-weight cycle in the constraint graph is reachable from v 0 . If the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns TRUE, then the shortest- path weights give a feasible solution to the system. In Figure 22.8, for example, the shortest-path weights provide the feasible solution x D .5; 3; 0; 1; 4/, and by Lemma 22.8, x D .d  5; d  3; d; d  1; d  4/ is also a feasible solution for any constant d . If the Bellman-Ford algorithm returns FALSE, there is no feasible solution to the system of difference constraints. A system of difference constraints with m constraints on n unknowns produces a graph with n C 1 vertices and n C m edges.

We stated these properties without proof on page 611. In this section, we prove them. The triangle inequality In studying breadth-ûrst search (Section 20.2), we proved as Lemma 20.1 a sim- ple property of shortest distances in unweighted graphs. The triangle inequality generalizes the property to weighted graphs. Lemma 22.10 (Triangle inequality) Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R and source vertex s . Then, for all edges .u; v/ 2 E, ı.s; v/ හ ı.s; u/ C w.u; v/ : Proof Suppose that p is a shortest path from source s to vertex v. Then p has no more weight than any other path from s to v. Speciûcally, path p has no more weight than the particular path that takes a shortest path from source s to vertex u and then takes edge .u; v/. Exercise 22.5-3 asks you to handle the case in which there is no shortest path from s to v. Effects of relaxation on shortest-path estimates The next group of lemmas describes how shortest-path estimates are affected by executing a sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of a weighted, directed graph that has been initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE. Lemma 22.11 (Upper-bound property) Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R. Let s 2 V be the source vertex, and let the graph be initialized by I NITIALIZE- SINGLE-SOURCE.G; s/. Then, v: d  ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V , and this invariant is maintained over any sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of G. Moreover, once v: d achieves its lower bound ı.s; v/, it never changes. Proof We prove the invariant v: d  ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V by induction over the number of relaxation steps. 634 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths For the base case, v: d  ı.s; v/ holds after initialization, since if v: d D 1, then v: d  ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V  fs g, and since s: d D 0  ı.s; s/. (Note that ı.s; s/ D 1 if s is on a negative-weight cycle and that ı.s; s/ D 0 otherwise.) For the inductive step, consider the relaxation of an edge .u; v/. By the inductive hypothesis, x: d  ı.s; x/ for all x 2 V prior to the relaxation. The only d value that may change is v: d. If it changes, we have v: d D u: d C w.u; v/  ı.s; u/ C w.u; v/ (by the inductive hypothesis)  ı.s; v/ (by the triangle inequality) , and so the invariant is maintained. The value of v: d never changes once v: d D ı.s; v/ because, having achieved its lower bound, v: d cannot decrease since we have just shown that v: d  ı.s; v/, and it cannot increase because relaxation steps do not increase d values. Corollary 22.12 (No-path property) Suppose that in a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R, no path connects a source vertex s 2 V to a given vertex v 2 V . Then, after the graph is initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/, we have v: d D ı.s; v/ D 1, and this equation is maintained as an invariant over any sequence of relaxation steps on the edges of G. Proof By the upper-bound property, we always have 1 D ı.s; v/ හ v: d, and thus v: d D 1 D ı.s; v/. Lemma 22.13 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, and let .u; v/ 2 E. Then, immediately after edge .u; v/ is relaxed by a call of RELAX.u; v; w/, we have v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/. Proof If, just prior to relaxing edge .u; v/, we have v: d > u: d C w.u; v/, then v: d D u: d C w.u; v/ afterward. If, instead, v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/ just before the relaxation, then neither u: d nor v: d changes, and so v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/ afterward. Lemma 22.14 (Convergence property) Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, let s 2 V be a source vertex, and let s ❀ u ! v be a shortest path in G for some vertices u; v 2 V . Suppose that G is initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE- SOURCE.G; s/ and then a sequence of relaxation steps that includes the call 22.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties 635 RELAX.u; v; w/ is executed on the edges of G. If u: d D ı.s; u/ at any time prior to the call, then v: d D ı.s; v/ at all times after the call. Proof By the upper-bound property, if u: d D ı.s; u/ at some point prior to relax- ing edge .u; v/, then this equation holds thereafter. In particular, after edge .u; v/ is relaxed, we have v: d හ u: d C w.u; v/ (by Lemma 22.13) D ı.s; u/ C w.u; v/ D ı.s; v/ (by Lemma 22.1 on page 606) . The upper-bound property gives v: d  ı.s; v/, from which we conclude that v: d D ı.s; v/, and this equation is maintained thereafter. Lemma 22.15 (Path-relaxation property) Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, and let s 2 V be a source vertex. Consider any shortest path p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i from s D v 0 to v k . If G is initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/ and then a sequence of relaxation steps occurs that includes, in order, relaxing the edges .v 0 ; v 1 /; .v 1 ; v 2 /; : : : ; .v k1 ; v k /, then v k : d D ı.s; v k / after these relaxations and at all times afterward. This property holds no matter what other edge relaxations occur, including relaxations that are intermixed with relaxations of the edges of p. Proof We show by induction that after the i th edge of path p is relaxed, we have v i : d D ı.s; v i /. For the base case, i D 0, and before any edges of p have been relaxed, we have from the initialization that v 0 : d D s: d D 0 D ı.s; s/. By the upper-bound property, the value of s: d never changes after initialization. For the inductive step, assume that v i 1 : d D ı.s; v i 1 /. What happens when edge .v i 1 ; v i / is relaxed? By the convergence property, after this relaxation, we have v i : d D ı.s; v i /, and this equation is maintained at all times thereafter. Relaxation and shortest-paths trees We now show that once a sequence of relaxations has caused the shortest-path es- timates to converge to shortest-path weights, the predecessor subgraph G  induced by the resulting � values is a shortest-paths tree for G. We start with the follow- ing lemma, which shows that the predecessor subgraph always forms a rooted tree whose root is the source. Lemma 22.16 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, let s 2 V be a source vertex, and assume that G contains no negative-weight 636 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths cycles that are reachable from s . Then, after the graph is initialized by I NITIALIZE- SINGLE-SOURCE.G; s/, the predecessor subgraph G  forms a rooted tree with root s , and any sequence of relaxation steps on edges of G maintains this property as an invariant. Proof Initially, the only vertex in G  is the source vertex, and the lemma is triv- ially true. Consider a predecessor subgraph G  that arises after a sequence of relaxation steps. We ûrst prove that G  is acyclic. Suppose for the sake of contra- diction that some relaxation step creates a cycle in the graph G  . Let the cycle be c D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v k D v 0 . Then, v i :� D v i 1 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k and, without loss of generality, assume that relaxing edge .v k1 ; v k / created the cycle in G  . We claim that all vertices on cycle c are reachable from the source vertex s . Why? Each vertex on c has a non-NIL predecessor, and so each vertex on c was as- signed a ûnite shortest-path estimate when it was assigned its non-NIL � value. By the upper-bound property, each vertex on cycle c has a ûnite shortest-path weight, which means that it is reachable from s . We9ll examine the shortest-path estimates on cycle c immediately before the call RELAX.v k1 ; v k ; w/ and show that c is a negative-weight cycle, thereby contra- dicting the assumption that G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from the source. Just before the call, we have v i :� D v i 1 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k  1. Thus, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k  1, the last update to v i : d was by the assignment v i : d D v i 1 : dCw.v i 1 ; v i /. If v i 1 : d changed since then, it decreased. Therefore, just before the call RELAX.v k1 ; v k ; w/, we have v i : d  v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i / for all i D 1; 2; : : : ; k  1 : (22.11) Because v k :� is changed by the call RELAX.v k1 ; v k ; w/, immediately beforehand we also have the strict inequality k : d > v k1 : d C w.v k1 ; v k / : Summing this strict inequality with the k  1 inequalities (22.11), we obtain the sum of the shortest-path estimates around cycle c : k X i D1 v i : d > k X i D1 .v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i // D k X i D1 v i 1 : d C k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / : But k X i D1 v i : d D k X i D1 v i 1 : d ; 22.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties 637 s u x y z v Figure 22.9 Showing that a simple path in G  from source vertex s to vertex v is unique. If G  contains two paths p 1 (s ❀ u ❀ x ! ´ ❀ v) and p 2 (s ❀ u ❀ y ! ´ ❀ v), where x ¤ y, then ´: � D x and ´: � D y, a contradiction. since each vertex in the cycle c appears exactly once in each summation. This equation implies 0 > k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / : Thus, the sum of weights around the cycle c is negative, which provides the desired contradiction. We have now proven that G  is a directed, acyclic graph. To show that it forms a rooted tree with root s , it sufûces (see Exercise B.5-2 on page 1175) to prove that for each vertex v 2 V  , there is a unique simple path from s to v in G  . The vertices in V  are those with non-NIL � values, plus s . Exercise 22.5-6 asks you to prove that a path from s exists to each vertex in V  . To complete the proof of the lemma, we now show that for any vertex v 2 V  , the graph G  contains at most one simple path from s to v. Suppose otherwise. That is, suppose that, as Figure 22.9 illustrates, G  contains two simple paths from s to some vertex v: p 1 , which we decompose into s ❀ u ❀ x ! ´ ❀ v, and p 2 , which we decompose into s ❀ u ❀ y ! ´ ❀ v, where x ¤ y (though u could be s and ´ could be v). But then, ´:� D x and ´:� D y , which implies the contradiction that x D y . We conclude that G  contains a unique simple path from s to v, and thus G  forms a rooted tree with root s . We can now show that if all vertices have been assigned their true shortest-path weights after a sequence of relaxation steps, then the predecessor subgraph G  is a shortest-paths tree. Lemma 22.17 (Predecessor-subgraph property) Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R, let s 2 V be a source vertex, and assume that G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from s . Then, after a call to I NITIALIZE-S INGLE-SOURCE .G; s/ followed by any sequence of relaxation steps on edges of G that produces v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V , the predecessor subgraph G  is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s . 638 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Proof We must prove that the three properties of shortest-paths trees given on page 608 hold for G  . To show the ûrst property, we must show that V  is the set of vertices reachable from s . By deûnition, a shortest-path weight ı.s; v/ is ûnite if and only if v is reachable from s , and thus the vertices that are reachable from s are exactly those with ûnite d values. But a vertex v 2 V  fs g has been assigned a ûnite value for v: d if and only if v:� ¤ NIL, since both assignments occur in RELAX. Thus, the vertices in V  are exactly those reachable from s . The second property, that G  forms a rooted tree with root s , follows directly from Lemma 22.16. It remains, therefore, to prove the last property of shortest-paths trees: for each vertex v 2 V  , the unique simple path s p ❀ v in G  is a shortest path from s to v in G. Let p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 0 D s and v k D v. Consider an edge .v i 1 ; v i / in path p. Because this edge belongs to G  , the last relax- ation that changed v i : d must have been of this edge. After that relaxation, we had v i : d D v i 1 : d C .v i 1 ; v i /. Subsequently, an edge entering v i 1 could have been relaxed, causing v i 1 : d to decrease further, but without changing v i : d. There- fore, we have v i : d  v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i /. Thus, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, we have both v i : d D ı.s; v i / and v i : d  v i 1 : d C w.v i 1 ; v i /, which together imply w.v i 1 ; v i / හ ı.s; v i /  ı.s; v i 1 /. Summing the weights along path p yields w.p/ D k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / හ k X i D1 .ı.s; v i /  ı.s; v i 1 // D ı.s; v k /  ı.s; v 0 / (because the sum telescopes) D ı.s; v k / (because ı.s; v 0 / D ı.s; s/ D 0) . Thus, we have w.p/ හ ı.s; v k /. Since ı.s; v k / is a lower bound on the weight of any path from s to v k , we conclude that w.p/ D ı.s; v k /, and p is a shortest path from s to v D v k . Exercises 22.5-1 Give two shortest-paths trees for the directed graph of Figure 22.2 on page 609 other than the two shown. 22.5-2 Give an example of a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R and source vertex s such that G satisûes the following property: For 22.5 Proofs of shortest-paths properties 639 every edge .u; v/ 2 E, there is a shortest-paths tree rooted at s that contains .u; v/ and another shortest-paths tree rooted at s that does not contain .u; v/. 22.5-3 Modify the proof of Lemma 22.10 to handle cases in which shortest-path weights are 1 or 1. 22.5-4 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with source vertex s , and let G be initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/. Prove that if a sequence of relaxation steps sets s:� to a non-NIL value, then G contains a negative-weight cycle. 22.5-5 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with no negative-weight edges. Let s 2 V be the source vertex, and suppose that v:� is allowed to be the predecessor of v on any shortest path to v from source s if v 2 V  fs g is reachable from s , and NIL otherwise. Give an example of such a graph G and an assignment of � values that produces a cycle in G  . (By Lemma 22.16, such an assignment cannot be produced by a sequence of relaxation steps.) 22.5-6 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function w W E ! R and no negative-weight cycles. Let s 2 V be the source vertex, and let G be initialized by I NITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE .G; s/. Use induction to prove that for every vertex v 2 V  , there exists a path from s to v in G  and that this property is maintained as an invariant over any sequence of relaxations. 22.5-7 Let G D .V; E/ be a weighted, directed graph that contains no negative-weight cycles. Let s 2 V be the source vertex, and let G be initialized by I NITIALIZE- SINGLE-SOURCE.G; s/. Prove that there exists a sequence of jV j  1 relaxation steps that produces v: d D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V . 22.5-8 Let G be an arbitrary weighted, directed graph with a negative-weight cycle reach- able from the source vertex s . Show how to construct an inûnite sequence of relax- ations of the edges of G such that every relaxation causes a shortest-path estimate to change. 640 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths Problems 22-1 Yen’s improvement to Bellman-Ford The Bellman-Ford algorithm does not specify the order in which to relax edges in each pass. Consider the following method for deciding upon the order. Before the ûrst pass, assign an arbitrary linear order v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v jV j to the vertices of the input graph G D .V; E/. Then partition the edge set E into E f [ E b , where E f D f.v i ; v j / 2 E W i < j g and E b D f.v i ; v j / 2 E W i > j g. (Assume that G contains no self-loops, so that every edge belongs to either E f or E b .) Deûne G f D .V; E f / and G b D .V; E b /. a. Prove that G f is acyclic with topological sort hv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v jV j i and that G b is acyclic with topological sort hv jV j ; v jV j1 ; : : : ; v 1 i. Suppose that each pass of the Bellman-Ford algorithm relaxes edges in the fol- lowing way. First, visit each vertex in the order v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v jV j , relaxing edges of E f that leave the vertex. Then visit each vertex in the order v jV j ; v jV j1 ; : : : ; v 1 , relaxing edges of E b that leave the vertex. b. Prove that with this scheme, if G contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from the source vertex s , then after only djV j =2e passes over the edges, v: d D ı.s; v/ for all vertices v 2 V . c. Does this scheme improve the asymptotic running time of the Bellman-Ford algorithm? 22-2 Nesting boxes A d -dimensional box with dimensions .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x d / nests within another box with dimensions .y 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y d / if there exists a permutation � on f1; 2; : : : ; d g such that x .1/ < y 1 , x .2/ < y 2 , . . . , x .d / < y d . a.

Express the running time of your algorithm in terms of n and d . Problems for Chapter 22 641 22-3 Arbitrage Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a currency into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that one U.S. dollar buys 64 Indian rupees, one Indian rupee buys 1:8 Japanese yen, and one Japanese yen buys 0:009 U.S. dollars. Then, by converting currencies, a trader can start with 1 U.S. dollar and buy 64  1:8  0:009 D 1:0368 U.S. dollars, thus turning a proût of 3:68%.

Analyze the running time of your algorithm. 22-4 Gabow’s scaling algorithm for single-source shortest paths A scaling algorithm solves a problem by initially considering only the highest- order bit of each relevant input value, such as an edge weight, assuming that these values are nonnegative integers. The algorithm then reûnes the initial solution by looking at the two highest-order bits. It progressively looks at more and more high-order bits, reûning the solution each time, until it has examined all bits and computed the correct solution. This problem examines an algorithm for computing the shortest paths from a single source by scaling edge weights. The input is a directed graph G D .V; E/ with nonnegative integer edge weights w. Let W D max fw.u; v/ W .u; v/ 2 Eg be the maximum weight of any edge. In this problem, you will develop an algo- rithm that runs in O.E lg W / time. Assume that all vertices are reachable from the source. The scaling algorithm uncovers the bits in the binary representation of the edge weights one at a time, from the most signiûcant bit to the least signiûcant bit. Speciûcally, let k D dlg.W C 1/e be the number of bits in the binary represen- tation of W , and for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k, let w i .u; v/ D  w.u; v/=2 ki ˘ . That is, w i .u; v/ is the <scaled-down= version of w.u; v/ given by the i most signiûcant bits of w.u; v/. (Thus, w k .u; v/ D w.u; v/ for all .u; v/ 2 E.) For example, if k D 5 and w.u; v/ D 25, which has the binary representation h11001i, then w 3 .u; v/ D h110i D 6. Also with k D 5, if w.u; v/ D h00100i D 4, then w 4 .u; v/ D h0010i D 2. Deûne ı i .u; v/ as the shortest-path weight from vertex u 642 Chapter 22 Single-Source Shortest Paths to vertex v using weight function w i , so that ı k .u; v/ D ı.u; v/ for all u; v 2 V . For a given source vertex s , the scaling algorithm ûrst computes the shortest-path weights ı 1 .s; v/ for all v 2 V , then computes ı 2 .s; v/ for all v 2 V , and so on, un- til it computes ı k .s; v/ for all v 2 V . Assume throughout that jEj  jV j  1. You will show how to compute ı i from ı i 1 in O.E/ time, so that the entire algorithm takes O.kE/ D O.E lg W / time. a.

For example the sequences h1; 4; 6; 8; 3; 2i, h9; 2; 4; 10; 5i , and h1; 2; 3; 4i are bitonic, but h1; 3; 12; 4; 2; 10i is not bitonic. (See Problem 14-3 on page 407 for the bitonic euclidean traveling-salesperson problem.) Suppose that you are given a directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R, where all edge weights are unique, and you wish to ûnd single-source shortest paths from a source vertex s . You are given one additional piece of infor- mation: for each vertex v 2 V , the weights of the edges along any shortest path from s to v form a bitonic sequence. Give the most efûcient algorithm you can to solve this problem, and analyze its running time. Chapter notes The shortest-path problem has a long history that is nicely desribed in an article by Schrijver [400]. He credits the general idea of repeatedly executing edge relax- ations to Ford [148]. Dijkstra9s algorithm [116] appeared in 1959, but it contained no mention of a priority queue. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is based on separate algorithms by Bellman [45] and Ford [149]. The same algorithm is also attributed to Moore [334]. Bellman describes the relation of shortest paths to difference con- straints. Lawler [276] describes the linear-time algorithm for shortest paths in a dag, which he considers part of the folklore. When edge weights are relatively small nonnegative integers, more efûcient al- gorithms result from using min-priority queues that require integer keys and rely on the sequence of values returned by the E XTRACT-MIN calls in Dijkstra9s al- gorithm monotonically increasing over time. Ahuja, Mehlhorn, Orlin, and Tar- jan [8] give an algorithm that runs in O.E C V p lg W / time on graphs with nonnegative edge weights, where W is the largest weight of any edge in the Notes for Chapter 22 645 graph. The best bounds are by Thorup [436], who gives an algorithm that runs in O.E lg lg V / time, and by Raman [375], who gives an algorithm that runs in O ã E C V min ˚ .lg V / 1=3C ; .lg W / 1=4C ä time. These two algorithms use an amount of space that depends on the word size of the underlying machine. Al- though the amount of space used can be unbounded in the size of the input, it can be reduced to be linear in the size of the input using randomized hashing. For undirected graphs with integer weights, Thorup [435] gives an algorithm that runs in O.V C E/ time for single-source shortest paths. In contrast to the algorithms mentioned in the previous paragraph, the sequence of values returned by EXTRACT-MIN calls does not monotonically increase over time, and so this algorithm is not an implementation of Dijkstra9s algorithm. Pettie and Ramachan- dran [357] remove the restriction of integer weights on undirected graphs. Their algorithm entails a preprocessing phase, followed by queries for speciûc source vertices. Preprocessing takes O.MST .V; E/ C min fV lg V; V lg lg r g/ time, where MST .V; E/ is the time to compute a minimum spanning tree and r is the ratio of the maximum edge weight to the minimum edge weight. After preprocessing, each query takes O.E lg y ˛.E; V // time, where y ˛.E; V / is the inverse of Acker- mann9s function. (See the chapter notes for Chapter 19 for a brief discussion of Ackermann9s function and its inverse.) For graphs with negative edge weights, an algorithm due to Gabow and Tar- jan [167] runs in O. p V E lg.V W // time, and one by Goldberg [186] runs in O. p V E lg W / time, where W D max fjw.u; v/j W .u; v/ 2 Eg. There has also been some progress based on methods that use continuous optimization and elec- trical üows. Cohen et al. [98] give such an algorithm, which is randomized and runs in e O.E 10=7 lg W / expected time (see Problem 3-6 on page 73 for the deûn- tion of e O-notation). There is also a pseudopolyomial-time algorithm based on fast matrix multiplication. Sankowski [394] and Yuster and Zwick [465] designed an algorithm for shortest paths that runs in e O.W V ! / time, where two n  n matri- ces can be multiplied in O.n ! / time, giving a faster algorithm than the previously mentioned algorithms for small values of W on dense graphs. Cherkassky, Goldberg, and Radzik [89] conducted extensive experiments com- paring various shortest-path algorithms. Shortest-path algorithms are widely used in real-time navigation and route-planning applications. Typically based on Dijk- stra9s algorithm, these algorithms use many clever ideas to be able to compute shortest paths on networks with many millions of vertices and edges in fractions of a second. Bast et al. [36] survey many of these developments. 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths In this chapter, we turn to the problem of ûnding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. A classic application of this problem occurs in computing a table of distances between all pairs of cities for a road atlas. Classic perhaps, but not a true application of ûnding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. After all, a road map modeled as a graph has one vertex for every road intersection and one edge wherever a road connects intersections. A table of intercity distances in an atlas might include distances for 100 cities, but the United States has approximately 300,000 signal-controlled intersections 1 and many more uncontrolled intersections. A legitimate application of all-pairs shortest paths is to determine the diameter of a network: the longest of all shortest paths. If a directed graph models a com- munication network, with the weight of an edge indicating the time required for a message to traverse a communication link, then the diameter gives the longest possible transit time for a message in the network. As in Chapter 22, the input is a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with a weight function w W E ! R that maps edges to real-valued weights. Now the goal is to ûnd, for every pair of vertices u; v 2 V , a shortest (least-weight) path from u to v, where the weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges. For the all-pairs problem, the output typically takes a tabular form in which the entry in u9s row and v9s column is the weight of a shortest path from u to v. You can solve an all-pairs shortest-paths problem by running a single-source shortest-paths algorithm jV j times, once with each vertex as the source. If all edge weights are nonnegative, you can use Dijkstra9s algorithm. If you imple- ment the min-priority queue with a linear array, the running time is O.V 3 C VE/ which is O.V 3 /. The binary min-heap implementation of the min-priority queue 1 According to a report cited by U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, <a reasonable 8rule of thumb9 is one signalized intersection per 1,000 population.= Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 647 yields a running time of O.V .V C E/ lg V /. If jEj D �.V / , the running time becomes O.VE lg V /, which is faster than O.V 3 / if the graph is sparse. Alterna- tively, you can implement the min-priority queue with a Fibonacci heap, yielding a running time of O.V 2 lg V C VE/. If the graph contains negative-weight edges, Dijkstra9s algorithm doesn9t work, but you can run the slower Bellman-Ford algorithm once from each vertex. The resulting running time is O.V 2 E/, which on a dense graph is O.V 4 /. This chapter shows how to guarantee a much better asymptotic running time. It also investigates the relation of the all-pairs shortest-paths problem to matrix multiplication. Unlike the single-source algorithms, which assume an adjacency-list representa- tion of the graph, most of the algorithms in this chapter represent the graph by an adjacency matrix. (Johnson9s algorithm for sparse graphs, in Section 23.3, uses adjacency lists.) For convenience, we assume that the vertices are numbered 1; 2; : : : ; jV j, so that the input is an n  n matrix W D .w ij / representing the edge weights of an n-vertex directed graph G D .V; E/, where w ij D Ĩ 0 if i D j ; the weight of directed edge .i; j / if i ¤ j and .i; j / 2 E ; 1 if i ¤ j and .i; j / … E : (23.1) The graph may contain negative-weight edges, but we assume for the time being that the input graph contains no negative-weight cycles. The tabular output of each of the all-pairs shortest-paths algorithms presented in this chapter is an n  n matrix. The .i; j / entry of the output matrix contains ı.i; j /, the shortest-path weight from vertex i to vertex j , as in Chapter 22. A full solution to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem includes not only the shortest-path weights but also a predecessor matrix … D .� ij /, where � ij is NIL if either i D j or there is no path from i to j , and otherwise � ij is the predeces- sor of j on some shortest path from i . Just as the predecessor subgraph G  from Chapter 22 is a shortest-paths tree for a given source vertex, the subgraph induced by the i th row of the … matrix should be a shortest-paths tree with root i . For each vertex i 2 V , the predecessor subgraph of G for i is G ;i D .V ;i ; E ;i /, where V ;i D fj 2 V W � ij ¤ NILg [ fi g ; E ;i D f.� ij ; j / W j 2 V ;i  fi gg : If G ;i is a shortest-paths tree, then PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-S HORTEST-PATH on the following page, which is a modiûed version of the PRINT-PATH procedure from Chapter 20, prints a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j . In order to highlight the essential features of the all-pairs algorithms in this chap- ter, we won9t cover how to compute predecessor matrices and their properties as extensively as we dealt with predecessor subgraphs in Chapter 22. Some of the exercises cover the basics. 648 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-S HORTEST-PATH .…; i; j / 1 if i == j 2 print i 3 elseif � ij == NIL 4 print <no path from= i <to= j <exists= 5 else PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH .…; i; � ij / 6 print j Chapter outline Section 23.1 presents a dynamic-programming algorithm based on matrix mul- tiplication to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem. The technique of <re- peated squaring= yields a running time of ‚.V 3 lg V /. Section 23.2 gives another dynamic-programming algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which runs in ‚.V 3 / time. Section 23.2 also covers the problem of ûnding the transitive closure of a directed graph, which is related to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem. Finally, Section 23.3 presents Johnson9s algorithm, which solves the all-pairs shortest-paths problem in O.V 2 lg V C VE/ time and is a good choice for large, sparse graphs. Before proceeding, we need to establish some conventions for adjacency-matrix representations. First, we generally assume that the input graph G D .V; E/ has n vertices, so that n D jV j. Second, we use the convention of denoting matrices by uppercase letters, such as W , L, or D, and their individual elements by subscripted lowercase letters, such as w ij , l ij , or d ij . Finally, some matrices have parenthesized superscripts, as in L .r/ D ã l .r/ ij ä or D .r/ D ã d .r/ ij ä , to indicate iterates. 23.1 Shortest paths and matrix multiplication This section presents a dynamic-programming algorithm for the all-pairs shortest- paths problem on a directed graph G D .V; E/. Each major loop of the dynamic program invokes an operation similar to matrix multiplication, so that the algorithm looks like repeated matrix multiplication. We9ll start by developing a ‚.V 4 /-time algorithm for the all-pairs shortest-paths problem, and then we9ll improve its run- ning time to ‚.V 3 lg V /. Before proceeding, let9s brieüy recap the steps given in Chapter 14 for develop- ing a dynamic-programming algorithm: 1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution. 2. Recursively deûne the value of an optimal solution. 3. Compute the value of an optimal solution in a bottom-up fashion. 23.1 Shortest paths and matrix multiplication 649 We reserve the fourth step4constructing an optimal solution from computed in- formation4for the exercises. The structure of a shortest path Let9s start by characterizing the structure of an optimal solution. Lemma 22.1 tells us that all subpaths of a shortest path are shortest paths. Consider a shortest path p from vertex i to vertex j , and suppose that p contains at most r edges. Assuming that there are no negative-weight cycles, r is ûnite. If i D j , then p has weight 0 and no edges. If vertices i and j are distinct, then decompose path p into i p 0 ❀ k ! j , where path p 0 now contains at most r  1 edges. Lemma 22.1 says that p 0 is a shortest path from i to k, and so ı.i; j / D ı.i; k/ C w kj . A recursive solution to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem Now, let l .r/ ij be the minimum weight of any path from vertex i to vertex j that contains at most r edges. When r D 0, there is a shortest path from i to j with no edges if and only if i D j , yielding l .0/ ij D ( 0 if i D j ; 1 if i ¤ j : (23.2) For r  1, one way to achieve a minimum-weight path from i to j with at most r edges is by taking a path containing at most r  1 edges, so that l .r/ ij D l .r 1/ ij . Another way is by taking a path of at most r  1 edges from i to some vertex k and then taking the edge .k; j /, so that l .r/ ij D l .r 1/ i k C w.k; j /. Therefore, to examine paths from i to j consisting of at most r edges, try all possible predecessors k of j , giving the recursive deûnition l .r/ ij D min n l .r 1/ ij ; min ˚ l .r 1/ i k C w kj W 1 හ k හ n  o D min ˚ l .r 1/ i k C w kj W 1 හ k හ n  : (23.3) The last equality follows from the observation that w jj D 0 for all j . What are the actual shortest-path weights ı.i; j /? If the graph contains no negative-weight cycles, then whenever ı.i; j / < 1, there is a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j that is simple. (A path p from i to j that is not simple contains a cycle. Since each cycle9s weight is nonnegative, removing all cycles from the path leaves a simple path with weight no greater than p9s weight.) Because any simple path contains at most n  1 edges, a path from vertex i to vertex j with more than n  1 edges cannot have lower weight than a shortest path from i to j . The actual shortest-path weights are therefore given by 650 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths ı.i; j / D l .n1/ ij D l .n/ ij D l .nC1/ ij D    : (23.4) Computing the shortest-path weights bottom up Taking as input the matrix W D .w ij /, let9s see how to compute a series of matrices L .0/ ; L .1/ ; : : : ; L .n1/ , where L .r/ D ã l .r/ ij ä for r D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. The initial matrix is L .0/ given by equation (23.2). The ûnal matrix L .n1/ contains the actual shortest-path weights. The heart of the algorithm is the procedure EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS, which implements equation (23.3) for all i and j . The four inputs are the matrix L .r 1/ computed so far; the edge-weight matrix W ; the output matrix L .r/ , which will hold the computed result and whose elements are all initialized to 1 before in- voking the procedure; and the number n of vertices. The superscripts r and r  1 help to make the correspondence of the pseudocode with equation (23.3) plain, but they play no actual role in the pseudocode. The procedure extends the shortest paths computed so far by one more edge, producing the matrix L .r/ of shortest- path weights from the matrix L .r 1/ computed so far. Its running time is ‚.n 3 / due to the three nested for loops. EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS .L .r 1/ ; W; L .r/ ; n/ 1 // Assume that the elements of L .r/ are initialized to 1. 2 for i D 1 to n 3 for j D 1 to n 4 for k D 1 to n 5 l .r/ ij D min ˚ l .r/ ij ; l .r 1/ i k C w kj  Let9s now understand the relation of this computation to matrix multiplication. Consider how to compute the matrix product C D A  B of two n  n matrices A and B . The straightforward method used by MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 81 uses a triply nested loop to implement equation (4.1), which we repeat here for convenience: ij D n X kD1 a i k  b kj ; (23.5) for i; j D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Now make the substitutions 23.1 Shortest paths and matrix multiplication 651 l .r 1/ ! a ; w ! b ; l .r/ ! c ; min ! C ; C !  in equation (23.3). You get equation (23.5)! Making these changes to EXTEND- SHORTEST-PATHS, and also replacing 1 (the identity for min) by 0 (the identity for C), yields the procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY. We can see that the proce- dure EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS .L .r 1/ ; W; L .r/ ; n/ computes the matrix <prod- uct= L .r/ D L .r 1/  W using this unusual deûnition of matrix multiplication. 2 Thus, we can solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem by repeatedly multi- plying matrices. Each step extends the shortest-path weights computed so far by one more edge using EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS .L .r 1/ ; W; L .r/ ; n/ to perform the matrix multiplication. Starting with the matrix L .0/ , we produce the following sequence of n  1 matrices corresponding to powers of W : L .1/ D L .0/  W D W 1 ; L .2/ D L .1/  W D W 2 ; L .3/ D L .2/  W D W 3 ; : : : L .n1/ D L .n2/  W D W n1 : At the end, the matrix L .n1/ D W n1 contains the shortest-path weights. The procedure SLOW-APSP on the next page computes this sequence in ‚.n 4 / time. The procedure takes the n  n matrices W and L .0/ as inputs, along with n. Figure 23.1 illustrates its operation. The pseudocode uses two n  n matrices L and M to store powers of W , computing M D L  W on each iteration. Line 2 initializes L D L .0/ . For each iteration r , line 4 initializes M D 1, where 1 in this context is a matrix of scalar 1 values. The r th iteration starts with the invariant L D L .r 1/ D W r 1 . Line 6 computes M D L  W D L .r 1/  W D W r 1  W D W r D L .r/ so that the invariant can be restored for the next iteration by line 7, which sets L D M . At the end, the matrix L D L .n1/ D W n1 of shortest-path weights is returned. The assignments to n  n matrices in lines 2, 4, and 7 implicitly run doubly nested loops that take ‚.n 2 / time for each assignment. 2 An algebraic semiring contains operations ˚, which is commutative with identity I ˚ , and ˝, with identity I ˝ , where ˝ distributes over ˚ on both the left and right, and where I ˚ ˝x D x ˝I ˚ D I ˚ for all x. Standard matrix multiplication, as in M ATRIX-MULTIPLY, uses the semiring with C for ˚,  for ˝, 0 for I ˚ , and 1 for I ˝ . The procedure EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS uses another semiring, known as the tropical semiring, with min for ˚, C for ˝, 1 for I ˚ , and 0 for I ˝ . 652 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 2 1 3 5 4 3 4 8 2 6 7 1 34 35 L .1/ D  0 3 8 1 4 1 0 1 1 7 1 4 0 1 1 2 1 5 0 1 1 1 1 6 0 ˘ L .2/ D  0 3 8 2 4 3 0 4 1 7 1 4 0 5 11 2 1 5 0 2 8 1 1 6 0 ˘ L .3/ D  0 3 3 2 4 3 0 4 1 1 7 4 0 5 11 2 1 5 0 2 8 5 1 6 0 ˘ L .4/ D  0 1 3 2 4 3 0 4 1 1 7 4 0 5 3 2 1 5 0 2 8 5 1 6 0 ˘ Figure 23.1 A directed graph and the sequence of matrices L .r/ computed by SLOW-APSP. You might want to verify that L .5/ , deûned as L .4/  W , equals L .4/ , and thus L .r/ D L .4/ for all r  4. The n  1 invocations of EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS, each of which takes ‚.n 3 / time, dominate the computation, yielding a total running time of ‚.n 4 /.

Recall that in the absence of negative-weight cycles, equa- tion (23.4) implies L .r/ D L .n1/ for all integers r  n  1. Just as tradi- tional matrix multiplication is associative, so is matrix multiplication deûned by the EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS procedure (see Exercise 23.1-4). In fact, we can compute L .n1/ with only dlg.n  1/e matrix products by using the technique of repeated squaring: 23.1 Shortest paths and matrix multiplication 653 L .1/ D W ; L .2/ D W 2 D W  W ; L .4/ D W 4 D W 2  W 2 L .8/ D W 8 D W 4  W 4 ; : : : L .2 dlg.n1/e / D W 2 dlg.n1/e D W 2 dlg.n1/e1  W 2 dlg.n1/e1 : Since 2 dlg.n1/e  n  1, the ûnal product is L .2 dlg.n1/e / D L .n1/ . The procedure FASTER-APSP implements this idea. It takes just the n  n matrix W and the size n as inputs. Each iteration of the while loop of lines 438 starts with the invariant L D W r , which it squares using EXTEND-SHORTEST- PATHS to obtain the matrix M D L 2 D .W r / 2 D W 2r . At the end of each iteration, the value of r doubles, and L for the next iteration becomes M , restoring the invariant. Upon exiting the loop when r  n  1, the procedure returns L D W r D L .r/ D L .n1/ by equation (23.4). As in SLOW-APSP, the assignments to n  n matrices in lines 2, 5, and 8 implicitly run doubly nested loops, taking ‚.n 2 / time for each assignment.

The code is tight, containing no elaborate data structures, and the constant hidden in the ‚-notation is therefore small.

As before, negative-weight edges may be present, but not negative-weight cycles. As in Section 23.1, we develop the algorithm by fol- lowing the dynamic-programming process. After studying the resulting algorithm, we present a similar method for ûnding the transitive closure of a directed graph. The structure of a shortest path In the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we characterize the structure of a shortest path differently from how we characterized it in Section 23.1. The Floyd-Warshall algo- rithm considers the intermediate vertices of a shortest path, where an intermediate vertex of a simple path p D hv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v l i is any vertex of p other than v 1 or v l , that is, any vertex in the set fv 2 ; v 3 ; : : : ; v l 1 g. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm relies on the following observation. Numbering the vertices of G by V D f1; 2; : : : ; ng, take a subset f1; 2; : : : ; kg of vertices for some 1 හ k හ n. For any pair of vertices i; j 2 V , consider all paths from i to j whose intermediate vertices are all drawn from f1; 2; : : : ; kg, and let p be a 656 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths i k j p 1 p 2 p: all intermediate vertices in f1; 2; : : : ; kg p 2 : all intermediate vertices in f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g p 1 : all intermediate vertices in f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g Figure 23.3 Optimal substructure used by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Path p is a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j , and k is the highest-numbered intermediate vertex of p. Path p 1 , the portion of path p from vertex i to vertex k, has all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. The same holds for path p 2 from vertex k to vertex j . minimum-weight path from among them. (Path p is simple.) The Floyd-Warshall algorithm exploits a relationship between path p and shortest paths from i to j with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. The details of the relationship depend on whether k is an intermediate vertex of path p or not.  If k is not an intermediate vertex of path p, then all intermediate vertices of path p belong to the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. Thus a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g is also a shortest path from i to j with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; kg.  If k is an intermediate vertex of path p, then decompose p into i p 1 ❀ k p 2 ❀ j , as Figure 23.3 illustrates. By Lemma 22.1, p 1 is a shortest path from i to k with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; kg. In fact, we can make a slightly stronger statement. Because vertex k is not an intermediate vertex of path p 1 , all intermediate vertices of p 1 belong to the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. Therefore p 1 is a shortest path from i to k with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. Likewise, p 2 is a shortest path from vertex k to vertex j with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g. A recursive solution to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem The above observations suggest a recursive formulation of shortest-path estimates that differs from the one in Section 23.1. Let d .k/ ij be the weight of a shortest path from vertex i to vertex j for which all intermediate vertices belong to the set f1; 2; : : : ; kg. When k D 0, a path from vertex i to vertex j with no intermediate vertex numbered higher than 0 has no intermediate vertices at all. Such a path has at most one edge, and hence d .0/ ij D w ij . Following the above discussion, deûne d .k/ ij recursively by 23.2 The Floyd-Warshall algorithm 657 d .k/ ij D ( w ij if k D 0 ; min ˚ d .k1/ ij ; d .k1/ i k C d .k1/ kj  if k  1 : (23.6) Because for any path, all intermediate vertices belong to the set f1; 2; : : : ; ng, the matrix D .n/ D ã d .n/ ij ä gives the ûnal answer: d .n/ ij D ı.i; j / for all i; j 2 V . Computing the shortest-path weights bottom up Based on recurrence (23.6), the bottom-up procedure F LOYD-WARSHALL com- putes the values d .k/ ij in order of increasing values of k. Its input is an n  n matrix W deûned as in equation (23.1). The procedure returns the matrix D .n/ of shortest-path weights. Figure 23.4 shows the matrices D .k/ computed by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for the graph in Figure 23.1. FLOYD-WARSHALL .W; n/ 1 D .0/ D W 2 for k D 1 to n 3 let D .k/ D ã d .k/ ij ä be a new n  n matrix 4 for i D 1 to n 5 for j D 1 to n 6 d .k/ ij D min ˚ d .k1/ ij ; d .k1/ i k C d .k1/ kj  7 return D .n/ The running time of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is determined by the triply nested for loops of lines 236. Because each execution of line 6 takes O.1/ time, the algorithm runs in ‚.n 3 / time. As in the ûnal algorithm in Section 23.1, the code is tight, with no elaborate data structures, and so the constant hidden in the ‚-notation is small. Thus, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is quite practical for even moderate-sized input graphs. Constructing a shortest path There are a variety of different methods for constructing shortest paths in the Floyd- Warshall algorithm. One way is to compute the matrix D of shortest-path weights and then construct the predecessor matrix … from the D matrix. Exercise 23.1-7 asks you to implement this method so that it runs in O.n 3 / time. Given the pre- decessor matrix …, the PRINT-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH procedure prints the vertices on a given shortest path. Alternatively, the predecessor matrix … can be computed while the algorithm computes the matrices D .0/ ; D .1/ ; : : : ; D .n/ .

Otherwise, when the path from i to j does not have k as an intermediate vertex, choose the same predecessor of j as on a shortest path from i with all intermediate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; k  1g.

Figure 23.4 shows the sequence of … .k/ matrices that the resulting algorithm computes for the graph of Figure 23.1. The exercise also asks for the more difûcult task of proving that the predecessor subgraph G ;i is a shortest-paths tree with root i . Exercise 23.2-7 asks for yet another way to reconstruct shortest paths. Transitive closure of a directed graph Given a directed graph G D .V; E/ with vertex set V D f1; 2; : : : ; ng, you might wish to determine simply whether G contains a path from i to j for all vertex pairs i; j 2 V , without regard to edge weights. We deûne the transitive closure of G as the graph G  D .V; E  /, where E  D f.i; j / W there is a path from vertex i to vertex j in Gg : One way to compute the transitive closure of a graph in ‚.n 3 / time is to assign a weight of 1 to each edge of E and run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. If there is a path from vertex i to vertex j , you get d ij < n. Otherwise, you get d ij D 1. There is another, similar way to compute the transitive closure of G in ‚.n 3 / time, which can save time and space in practice. This method substitutes the log- ical operations _ (logical OR) and ^ (logical AND) for the arithmetic operations min and C in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. For i; j; k D 1; 2; : : : ; n, deûne t .k/ ij to be 1 if there exists a path in graph G from vertex i to vertex j with all interme- diate vertices in the set f1; 2; : : : ; kg, and 0 otherwise. To construct the transitive closure G  D .V; E  /, put edge .i; j / into E  if and only if t .n/ ij D 1. A recursive deûnition of t .k/ ij , analogous to recurrence (23.6), is 660 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 1 2 4 3 T .0/ D ã 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ä T .1/ D ã 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 ä T .2/ D ã 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ä T .3/ D ã 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ä T .4/ D ã 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ä Figure 23.5 A directed graph and the matrices T .k/ computed by the transitive-closure algorithm. t .0/ ij D ( 0 if i ¤ j and .i; j / … E ; 1 if i D j or .i; j / 2 E ; and for k  1, t .k/ ij D t .k1/ ij _ ã t .k1/ i k ^ t .k1/ kj ä : (23.9) As in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, the TRANSITIVE-CLOSURE procedure com- putes the matrices T .k/ D ã t .k/ ij ä in order of increasing k.

The TRANSITIVE-CLOSURE procedure, like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, runs in ‚.n 3 / time. On some computers, though, log- ical operations on single-bit values execute faster than arithmetic operations on integer words of data. Moreover, because the direct transitive-closure algorithm 23.2 The Floyd-Warshall algorithm 661 uses only boolean values rather than integer values, its space requirement is less than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm9s by a factor corresponding to the size of a word of computer storage. Exercises 23.2-1 Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the weighted, directed graph of Figure 23.2. Show the matrix D .k/ that results for each iteration of the outer loop. 23.2-2 Show how to compute the transitive closure using the technique of Section 23.1. 23.2-3 Modify the FLOYD-WARSHALL procedure to compute the … .k/ matrices according to equations (23.7) and (23.8). Prove rigorously that for all i 2 V , the predecessor subgraph G ;i is a shortest-paths tree with root i .

Assume that jV j D O.E/ and that the graph is represented with adjacency lists. 23.2-9 Suppose that it takes f .jV j ; jEj/ time to compute the transitive closure of a di- rected acyclic graph, where f is a monotonically increasing function of both jV j and jEj. Show that the time to compute the transitive closure G  D .V; E  / of a general directed graph G D .V; E/ is then f .jV j ; jEj/ C O.V C E  /. 23.3 Johnson’s algorithm for sparse graphs Johnson9s algorithm ûnds shortest paths between all pairs in O.V 2 lg V C VE/ time. For sparse graphs, it is asymptotically faster than either repeated squaring of matrices or the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The algorithm either returns a matrix of shortest-path weights for all pairs of vertices or reports that the input graph contains a negative-weight cycle. Johnson9s algorithm uses as subroutines both Dijkstra9s algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which Chapter 22 describes. Johnson9s algorithm uses the technique of reweighting, which works as follows. If all edge weights w in a graph G D .V; E/ are nonnegative, Dijkstra9s algo- rithm can ûnd shortest paths between all pairs of vertices by running it once from each vertex. With the Fibonacci-heap min-priority queue, the running time of this all-pairs algorithm is O.V 2 lg V C VE/. If G has negative-weight edges but no negative-weight cycles, ûrst compute a new set of nonnegative edge weights so 23.3 Johnson’s algorithm for sparse graphs 663 that Dijkstra9s algorithm applies. The new set of edge weights y w must satisfy two important properties: 1. For all pairs of vertices u; v 2 V , a path p is a shortest path from u to v using weight function w if and only if p is also a shortest path from u to v using weight function y w. 2. For all edges .u; v/, the new weight y w.u; v/ is nonnegative. As we9ll see in a moment, preprocessing G to determine the new weight function y w takes O.VE/ time. Preserving shortest paths by reweighting The following lemma shows how to reweight the edges to satisfy the ûrst property above. We use ı to denote shortest-path weights derived from weight function w and y ı to denote shortest-path weights derived from weight function y w. Lemma 23.1 (Reweighting does not change shortest paths) Given a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R, let h W V ! R be any function mapping vertices to real numbers. For each edge .u; v/ 2 E, deûne y w.u; v/ D w.u; v/ C h.u/  h.v/ : (23.10) Let p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i be any path from vertex v 0 to vertex v k . Then p is a shortest path from v 0 to v k with weight function w if and only if it is a shortest path with weight function y w. That is, w.p/ D ı.v 0 ; v k / if and only if y w.p/ D y ı.v 0 ; v k /. Furthermore, G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function w if and only if G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function y w. Proof We start by showing that y w.p/ D w.p/ C h.v 0 /  h.v k / : (23.11) We have y w.p/ D k X i D1 y w.v i 1 ; v i / D k X i D1 .w.v i 1 ; v i / C h.v i 1 /  h.v i // D k X i D1 w.v i 1 ; v i / C h.v 0 /  h.v k / (because the sum telescopes) D w.p/ C h.v 0 /  h.v k / : 664 Chapter 23 All-Pairs Shortest Paths Therefore, any path p from v 0 to v k has y w.p/ D w.p/ C h.v 0 /  h.v k /. Be- cause h.v 0 / and h.v k / do not depend on the path, if one path from v 0 to v k is shorter than another using weight function w, then it is also shorter using y w. Thus, w.p/ D ı.v 0 ; v k / if and only if y w.p/ D y ı.v 0 ; v k /. Finally, we show that G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function w if and only if G has a negative-weight cycle using weight function y w. Consider any cycle c D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i, where v 0 D v k . By equation (23.11), y w.c/ D w.c/ C h.v 0 /  h.v k / D w.c/ ; and thus c has negative weight using w if and only if it has negative weight us- ing y w. Producing nonnegative weights by reweighting Our next goal is to ensure that the second property holds: y w.u; v/ must be nonneg- ative for all edges .u; v/ 2 E. Given a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/ with weight function w W E ! R, we9ll see how to make a new graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where V 0 D V [ fs g for some new vertex s … V and E 0 D E [ f.s; v/ W v 2 V g. To incorporate the new vertex s , extend the weight function w so that w.s; v/ D 0 for all v 2 V . Since no edges enter s , no shortest paths in G 0 , other than those with source s , contain s . Moreover, G 0 has no negative-weight cycles if and only if G has no negative-weight cycles. Figure 23.6(a) shows the graph G 0 corresponding to the graph G of Figure 23.1. Now suppose that G and G 0 have no negative-weight cycles. Deûne the func- tion h.v/ D ı.s; v/ for all v 2 V 0 . By the triangle inequality (Lemma 22.10 on page 633), we have h.v/ හ h.u/ C w.u; v/ for all edges .u; v/ 2 E 0 . Thus, by deûning reweighted edge weights y w according to equation (23.10), we have y w.u; v/ D w.u; v/ C h.u/  h.v/  0, thereby satisfying the second property. Figure 23.6(b) shows the graph G 0 from Figure 23.6(a) with reweighted edges. Computing all-pairs shortest paths Johnson9s algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest paths uses the Bellman-Ford al- gorithm (Section 22.1) and Dijkstra9s algorithm (Section 22.3) as subroutines. The pseudocode appears in the procedure J OHNSON on page 666. It assumes implic- itly that the edges are stored in adjacency lists. The algorithm returns the usual jV j  jV j matrix D D .d ij /, where d ij D ı.i; j /, or it reports that the input graph contains a negative-weight cycle. As is typical for an all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm, it assumes that the vertices are numbered from 1 to jV j. 23.3 Johnson’s algorithm for sparse graphs 665 2 1 5 4 3 4 8 2 6 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2/1 2/33 2/2 0/34 2/3 0/34 0/1 2/31 2/7 0/4 0/5 2/3 2/2 0/31 0/35 2/–2 4/8 2/5 2/1 2/6 (a) (c) (b) 34 34 31 35 35 3 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 34 31 35 0 3 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 0 0 3 (d) 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 0 0 3 (e) 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 0 0 3 (f) 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 0 0 3 (g) 2 1 5 4 4 0 13 2 2 10 0 0 0 3 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 0 Figure 23.6 Johnson9s all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm run on the graph of Figure 23.1.

Figure 23.6 depicts the execution of Johnson9s algorithm. If the min-priority queue in Dijkstra9s algorithm is implemented by a Fibonacci heap, Johnson9s algorithm runs in O.V 2 lg V CVE/ time. The simpler binary min- heap implementation yields a running time of O.VE lg V /, which is still asymp- totically faster than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm if the graph is sparse.

Then show that if G is strongly con- nected (every vertex is reachable from every other vertex), the results returned by J OHNSON with the professor9s modiûcation are correct. Problems 23-1 Transitive closure of a dynamic graph You wish to maintain the transitive closure of a directed graph G D .V; E/ as you insert edges into E. That is, after inserting an edge, you update the transitive closure of the edges inserted so far. Start with G having no edges initially, and represent the transitive closure by a boolean matrix. a.

Show how to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem in O.VE/ time on an � -dense directed graph G D .V; E/ that may have negative-weight edges but has no negative-weight cycles. Chapter notes Lawler [276] has a good discussion of the all-pairs shortest-paths problem. He attributes the matrix-multiplication algorithm to the folklore. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is due to Floyd [144], who based it on a theorem of Warshall [450] that describes how to compute the transitive closure of boolean matrices. Johnson9s algorithm is taken from [238]. Several researchers have given improved algorithms for computing shortest paths via matrix multiplication. Fredman [153] shows how to solve the all- pairs shortest paths problem using O.V 5=2 / comparisons between sums of edge weights and obtains an algorithm that runs in O.V 3 .lg lg V = lg V / 1=3 / time, which is slightly better than the running time of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This bound Notes for Chapter 23 669 has been improved several times, and the fastest algorithm is now by Williams [457], with a running time of O.V 3 =2 .lg 1=2 V / /. Another line of research demonstrates how to apply algorithms for fast matrix multiplication (see the chapter notes for Chapter 4) to the all-pairs shortest paths problem. Let O.n ! / be the running time of the fastest algorithm for multiplying two n  n matrices. Galil and Margalit [170, 171] and Seidel [403] designed al- gorithms that solve the all-pairs shortest paths problem in undirected, unweighted graphs in .V ! p.V // time, where p.n/ denotes a particular function that is poly- logarithmically bounded in n. In dense graphs, these algorithms are faster than the O.VE/ time needed to perform jV j breadth-ûrst searches. Several researchers have extended these results to give algorithms for solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem in undirected graphs in which the edge weights are integers in the range f1; 2; : : : ; W g. The asymptotically fastest such algorithm, by Shoshan and Zwick [410], runs in O.W V ! p.V W // time. In directed graphs, the best algorithm to date is due to Zwick [467] and runs in e O.W 1=.4!/ V 2C1=.4!/ / time. Karger, Koller, and Phillips [244] and independently McGeoch [320] have given a time bound that depends on E  , the set of edges in E that participate in some shortest path. Given a graph with nonnegative edge weights, their algorithms run in O.VE  C V 2 lg V / time and improve upon running Dijkstra9s algorithm jV j times when jE  j D o.E/. Pettie [355] uses an approach based on component hierarchies to achieve a running time of O.VE C V 2 lg lg V /, and the same running time is also achieved by Hagerup [205]. Baswana, Hariharan, and Sen [37] examined decremental algorithms, which al- low a sequence of intermixed edge deletions and queries, for maintaining all-pairs shortest paths and transitive-closure information. When a path exists, their ran- domized transitive-closure algorithm can fail to report it with probability 1=n c for an arbitrary c > 0. The query times are O.1/ with high probability. For transitive closure, the amortized time for each update is O.V 4=3 lg 1=3 V /. By comparison, Problem 23-1, in which edges are inserted, asks for an incremental algorithm. For all-pairs shortest paths, the update times depend on the queries. For queries just giving the shortest-path weights, the amortized time per update is O.V 3 =E lg 2 V /. To report the actual shortest path, the amortized update time is min ˚ O.V 3=2 p lg V /; O.V 3 =E lg 2 V /  . Demetrescu and Italiano [111] showed how to handle update and query operations when edges are both inserted and deleted, as long as the range of edge weights is bounded. Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5] deûned an algebraic structure known as a <closed semiring,= which serves as a general framework for solving path problems in di- rected graphs. Both the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the transitive-closure algo- rithm from Section 23.2 are instantiations of an all-pairs algorithm based on closed semirings. Maggs and Plotkin [309] showed how to ûnd minimum spanning trees using a closed semiring. 24 Maximum Flow Just as you can model a road map as a directed graph in order to ûnd the shortest path from one point to another, you can also interpret a directed graph as a <üow network= and use it to answer questions about material üows. Imagine a mate- rial coursing through a system from a source, where the material is produced, to a sink, where it is consumed. The source produces the material at some steady rate, and the sink consumes the material at the same rate. The <üow= of the mate- rial at any point in the system is intuitively the rate at which the material moves. Flow networks can model many problems, including liquids üowing through pipes, parts through assembly lines, current through electrical networks, and information through communication networks. You can think of each directed edge in a üow network as a conduit for the mate- rial. Each conduit has a stated capacity, given as a maximum rate at which the ma- terial can üow through the conduit, such as 200 gallons of liquid per hour through a pipe or 20 amperes of electrical current through a wire. Vertices are conduit junctions, and other than the source and sink, material üows through the vertices without collecting in them. In other words, the rate at which material enters a ver- tex must equal the rate at which it leaves the vertex. We call this property <üow conservation,= and it is equivalent to Kirchhoff9s current law when the material is electrical current. The goal of the maximum-üow problem is to compute the greatest rate for ship- ping material from the source to the sink without violating any capacity constraints. It is one of the simplest problems concerning üow networks and, as we shall see in this chapter, this problem can be solved by efûcient algorithms. Moreover, other network-üow problems are solvable by adapting the basic techniques used in maximum-üow algorithms. This chapter presents two general methods for solving the maximum-üow prob- lem. Section 24.1 formalizes the notions of üow networks and üows, formally deûning the maximum-üow problem. Section 24.2 describes the classical method 24.1 Flow networks 671 of Ford and Fulkerson for ûnding maximum üows. We ûnish up with a simple application of this method, ûnding a maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph, in Section 24.3. (Section 25.1 will give a more efûcient algorithm that is speciûcally designed to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite graph.) 24.1 Flow networks This section gives a graph-theoretic deûnition of üow networks, discusses their properties, and deûnes the maximum-üow problem precisely. It also introduces some helpful notation. Flow networks and ﬂows A üow network G D .V; E/ is a directed graph in which each edge .u; v/ 2 E has a nonnegative capacity c.u; v/  0. We further require that if E contains an edge .u; v/, then there is no edge .v; u/ in the reverse direction. (We9ll see shortly how to work around this restriction.) If .u; v/ … E, then for convenience we deûne c.u; v/ D 0, and we disallow self-loops. Each üow network contains two distinguished vertices: a source s and a sink t . For convenience, we assume that each vertex lies on some path from the source to the sink. That is, for each vertex v 2 V , the üow network contains a path s ❀ v ❀ t . Because each vertex other than s has at least one entering edge, we have jEj  jV j  1. Figure 24.1 shows an example of a üow network. s t 16 12 20 7 9 4 13 14 4 Edmonton Calgary Saskatoon Regina Vancouver Winnipeg s t 11/16 12/12 15/20 7/7 4 / 9 1/4 8/13 11/14 4/4 (a) (b) v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 v 4 v 4 Figure 24.1 (a) A üow network G D .V; E/ for the Lucky Puck Company9s trucking problem.

Each edge is labeled with its capacity. (b) A üow f in G with value jf j D 19. Each edge .u; v/ is labeled by f .u; v/=c.u; v/. The slash notation merely separates the üow and capacity and does not indicate division. 672 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow We are now ready to deûne üows more formally. Let G D .V; E/ be a üow network with a capacity function c . Let s be the source of the network, and let t be the sink. A üow in G is a real-valued function f W V  V ! R that satisûes the following two properties: Capacity constraint: For all u; v 2 V , we require 0 හ f .u; v/ හ c.u; v/ : The üow from one vertex to another must be nonnegative and must not exceed the given capacity. Flow conservation: For all u 2 V  fs; t g, we require X v2V f .v; u/ D X v2V f .u; v/ : The total üow into a vertex other than the source or sink must equal the total üow out of that vertex4informally, <üow in equals üow out.= When .u; v/ … E, there can be no üow from u to v, and f .u; v/ D 0. We call the nonnegative quantity f .u; v/ the üow from vertex u to vertex v. The value jf j of a üow f is deûned as jf j D X v2V f .s; v/  X v2V f .v; s/ ; (24.1) that is, the total üow out of the source minus the üow into the source. (Here, the jj notation denotes üow value, not absolute value or cardinality.) Typically, a üow network does not have any edges into the source, and the üow into the source, given by the summation P v2V f .v; s/, is 0. We include it, however, because when we introduce residual networks later in this chapter, the üow into the source can be positive. In the maximum-üow problem, the input is a üow network G with source s and sink t , and the goal is to ûnd a üow of maximum value. An example of ﬂow A üow network can model the trucking problem shown in Figure 24.1(a). The Lucky Puck Company has a factory (source s ) in Vancouver that manufactures hockey pucks, and it has a warehouse (sink t ) in Winnipeg that stocks them. Lucky Puck leases space on trucks from another ûrm to ship the pucks from the factory to the warehouse. Because the trucks travel over speciûed routes (edges) between cities (vertices) and have a limited capacity, Lucky Puck can ship at most c.u; v/ crates per day between each pair of cities u and v in Figure 24.1(a). Lucky Puck 24.1 Flow networks 673 s t 16 12 20 7 9 4 13 14 4 (a) (b) 10 s t 16 12 20 7 9 4 13 14 4 10 10 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 v 4 v 4 v 0 Figure 24.2 Converting a network with antiparallel edges to an equivalent one with no antiparallel edges. (a) A üow network containing both the edges .v 1 ; v 2 / and .v 2 ; v 1 /. (b) An equivalent network with no antiparallel edges. A new vertex v 0 was added, and edge .v 1 ; v 2 / was replaced by the pair of edges .v 1 ; v 0 / and .v 0 ; v 2 /, both with the same capacity as .v 1 ; v 2 /. has no control over these routes and capacities, and so the company cannot alter the üow network shown in Figure 24.1(a). They need to determine the largest number p of crates per day that they can ship and then to produce this amount, since there is no point in producing more pucks than they can ship to their warehouse. Lucky Puck is not concerned with how long it takes for a given puck to get from the factory to the warehouse. They care only that p crates per day leave the factory and p crates per day arrive at the warehouse. A üow in this network models the <üow= of shipments because the number of crates shipped per day from one city to another is subject to a capacity constraint. Additionally, the model must obey üow conservation, for in a steady state, the rate at which pucks enter an intermediate city must equal the rate at which they leave. Otherwise, crates would accumulate at intermediate cities. Modeling problems with antiparallel edges Suppose that the trucking ûrm offers Lucky Puck the opportunity to lease space for 10 crates in trucks going from Edmonton to Calgary. It might seem natural to add this opportunity to our example and form the network shown in Figure 24.2(a). This network suffers from one problem, however: it violates the original assump- tion that if edge .v 1 ; v 2 / 2 E, then .v 2 ; v 1 / … E. We call the two edges .v 1 ; v 2 / and .v 2 ; v 1 / antiparallel. Thus, to model a üow problem with antiparallel edges, the network must be transformed into an equivalent one containing no antiparal- lel edges. Figure 24.2(b) displays this equivalent network. To transform the net- work, choose one of the two antiparallel edges, in this case .v 1 ; v 2 /, and split it by adding a new vertex v 0 and replacing edge .v 1 ; v 2 / with the pair of edges .v 1 ; v 0 / and .v 0 ; v 2 /. Also set the capacity of both new edges to the capacity of the orig- inal edge. The resulting network satisûes the property that if an edge belongs to 674 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow ∞ (a) ∞ ∞ (b) s t 3 15 6 20 s 1 s 2 s 3 t 1 t 2 10 1 2 5 8 14 3 15 6 20 s 1 s 2 s 3 t 1 t 2 10 1 2 5 8 14 ∞ ∞ Figure 24.3 Converting a multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-üow problem into a problem with a single source and a single sink.

Add a supersource s and an edge with inûnite capacity from s to each of the multiple sources. Also add a supersink t and an edge with inûnite capacity from each of the multiple sinks to t . the network, the reverse edge does not. As Exercise 24.1-1 asks you to prove, the resulting network is equivalent to the original one. Networks with multiple sources and sinks A maximum-üow problem may have several sources and sinks, rather than just one of each. The Lucky Puck Company, for example, might actually have a set of m factories fs 1 ; s 2 ; : : : ; s m g and a set of n warehouses ft 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t n g, as shown in Figure 24.3(a). Fortunately, this problem is no harder than ordinary maximum üow. The problem of determining a maximum üow in a network with multiple sources and multiple sinks reduces to an ordinary maximum-üow problem. Figure 24.3(b) shows how to convert the network from (a) to an ordinary üow network with only a single source and a single sink. Add a supersource s and add a directed edge .s; s i / with capacity c.s; s i / D 1 for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; m. Similarly, create a new supersink t and add a directed edge .t i ; t/ with capacity c.t i ; t/ D 1 for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. Intuitively, any üow in the network in (a) corresponds to a üow in the network in (b), and vice versa. The single supersource s provides as much üow as desired for the multiple sources s i , and the single supersink t likewise consumes as much üow as desired for the multiple sinks t i . Exercise 24.1-2 asks you to prove formally that the two problems are equivalent. 24.1 Flow networks 675 Exercises 24.1-1 Show that splitting an edge in a üow network yields an equivalent network. More formally, suppose that üow network G contains edge .u; v/, and deûne a new üow network G 0 by creating a new vertex x and replacing .u; v/ by new edges .u; x/ and .x; v/ with c.u; x/ D c.x; v/ D c.u; v/. Show that a maximum üow in G 0 has the same value as a maximum üow in G. 24.1-2 Extend the üow properties and deûnitions to the multiple-source, multiple-sink problem. Show that any üow in a multiple-source, multiple-sink üow network corresponds to a üow of identical value in the single-source, single-sink network obtained by adding a supersource and a supersink, and vice versa. 24.1-3 Suppose that a üow network G D .V; E/ violates the assumption that the network contains a path s ❀ v ❀ t for all vertices v 2 V . Let u be a vertex for which there is no path s ❀ u ❀ t . Show that there must exist a maximum üow f in G such that f .u; v/ D f .v; u/ D 0 for all vertices v 2 V . 24.1-4 Let f be a üow in a network, and let ˛ be a real number.

The prob- lem is so severe that not only do they refuse to walk to school together, but in fact each one refuses to walk on any block that the other child has stepped on that day. The children have no problem with their paths crossing at a corner. Fortunately both the professor9s house and the school are on corners, but beyond that he is not sure if it is going to be possible to send both of his children to the same school. The professor has a map of his town. Show how to formulate the problem of de- termining whether both his children can go to the same school as a maximum-üow problem. 676 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow 24.1-7 Suppose that, in addition to edge capacities, a üow network has vertex capacities. That is each vertex v has a limit l.v/ on how much üow can pass through v. Show how to transform a üow network G D .V; E/ with vertex capacities into an equiv- alent üow network G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / without vertex capacities, such that a maximum üow in G 0 has the same value as a maximum üow in G. How many vertices and edges does G 0 have? 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method This section presents the Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the maximum-üow problem. We call it a <method= rather than an <algorithm= because it encompasses several implementations with differing running times. The Ford-Fulkerson method depends on three important ideas that transcend the method and are relevant to many üow algorithms and problems: residual networks, augmenting paths, and cuts. These ideas are essential to the important max-üow min-cut theorem (The- orem 24.6), which characterizes the value of a maximum üow in terms of cuts of the üow network. We end this section by presenting one speciûc implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method and analyzing its running time. The Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively increases the value of the üow. It starts with f .u; v/ D 0 for all u; v 2 V , giving an initial üow of value 0. Each iteration increases the üow value in G by ûnding an <augmenting path= in an associated <residual network= G f . The edges of the augmenting path in G f indicate on which edges in G to update the üow in order to increase the üow value. Although each iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson method increases the value of the üow, we9ll see that the üow on any particular edge of G may increase or decrease. Although it might seem counterintuitive to decrease the üow on an edge, doing so may enable üow to increase on other edges, allowing more üow to travel from the source to the sink. The Ford-Fulkerson method, given in the procedure FORD-FULKERSON- METHOD, repeatedly augments the üow until the residual network has no more augmenting paths. The max-üow min-cut theorem shows that upon termination, this process yields a maximum üow. FORD-FULKERSON-METHOD .G; s; t/ 1 initialize üow f to 0 2 while there exists an augmenting path p in the residual network G f 3 augment üow f along p 4 return f 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 677 In order to implement and analyze the Ford-Fulkerson method, we need to in- troduce several additional concepts. Residual networks Intuitively, given a üow network G and a üow f , the residual network G f consists of edges whose capacities represent how the üow can change on edges of G. An edge of the üow network can admit an amount of additional üow equal to the edge9s capacity minus the üow on that edge. If that value is positive, that edge goes into G f with a <residual capacity= of c f .u; v/ D c.u; v/  f .u; v/. The only edges of G that belong to G f are those that can admit more üow. Those edges .u; v/ whose üow equals their capacity have c f .u; v/ D 0, and they do not belong to G f . You might be surprised that the residual network G f can also contain edges that are not in G. As an algorithm manipulates the üow, with the goal of increasing the total üow, it might need to decrease the üow on a particular edge in order to increase the üow elsewhere. In order to represent a possible decrease in the positive üow f .u; v/ on an edge in G, the residual network G f contains an edge .v; u/ with residual capacity c f .v; u/ D f .u; v/4that is, an edge that can admit üow in the opposite direction to .u; v/, at most canceling out the üow on .u; v/. These reverse edges in the residual network allow an algorithm to send back üow it has already sent along an edge. Sending üow back along an edge is equivalent to decreasing the üow on the edge, which is a necessary operation in many algorithms. More formally, for a üow network G D .V; E/ with source s , sink t , and a üow f , consider a pair of vertices u; v 2 V . We deûne the residual capac- ity c f .u; v/ by c f .u; v/ D Ĩ c.u; v/  f .u; v/ if .u; v/ 2 E ; f .v; u/ if .v; u/ 2 E ; 0 otherwise : (24.2) In a üow network, .u; v/ 2 E implies .v; u/ … E, and so exactly one case in equation (24.2) applies to each ordered pair of vertices. As an example of equation (24.2), if c.u; v/ D 16 and f .u; v/ D 11, then f .u; v/ can increase by up to c f .u; v/ D 5 units before exceeding the capacity constraint on edge .u; v/. Alternatively, up to 11 units of üow can return from v to u, so that c f .v; u/ D 11. Given a üow network G D .V; E/ and a üow f , the residual network of G induced by f is G f D .V; E f /, where E f D f.u; v/ 2 V  V W c f .u; v/ > 0g : (24.3) 678 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow 9 15 s t 5 12 5 7 5 3 1 8 11 4 s t 11/16 12/12 19/20 7/7 9 1/4 12/13 11/14 4/4 (b) (c) 11 5 3 4 s t 11/16 12/12 15/20 7/7 4 / 9 1/4 8/13 11/14 4/4 (d) 19 s t 5 12 1 7 3 1 12 11 4 11 1 3 (a) v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 Figure 24.4 (a) The üow network G and üow f of Figure 24.1(b).

That is, as promised above, each edge of the residual network, or residual edge, can admit a üow that is greater than 0. Figure 24.4(a) repeats the üow network G and üow f of Figure 24.1(b), and Figure 24.4(b) shows the corresponding residual network G f . The edges in E f are either edges in E or their reversals, and thus jE f j හ 2 jEj : Observe that the residual network G f is similar to a üow network with capac- ities given by c f . It does not satisfy the deûnition of a üow network, however, because it could contain antiparallel edges. Other than this difference, a residual network has the same properties as a üow network, and we can deûne a üow in the residual network as one that satisûes the deûnition of a üow, but with respect to capacities c f in the residual network G f . A üow in a residual network provides a roadmap for adding üow to the original üow network. If f is a üow in G and f 0 is a üow in the corresponding residual network G f , we deûne f \" f 0 , the augmentation of üow f by f 0 , to be a function from V  V to R, deûned by 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 679 .f \" f 0 /.u; v/ D ( f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/  f 0 .v; u/ if .u; v/ 2 E ; 0 otherwise : (24.4) The intuition behind this deûnition follows the deûnition of the residual network. The üow on .u; v/ increases by f 0 .u; v/, but decreases by f 0 .v; u/ because push- ing üow on the reverse edge in the residual network signiûes decreasing the üow in the original network. Pushing üow on the reverse edge in the residual network is also known as cancellation. For example, suppose that 5 crates of hockey pucks go from u to v and 2 crates go from v to u. That is equivalent (from the perspective of the ûnal result) to sending 3 crates from u to v and none from v to u. Cancellation of this type is crucial for any maximum-üow algorithm. The following lemma shows that augmenting a üow in G by a üow in G f yields a new üow in G with a greater üow value. Lemma 24.1 Let G D .V; E/ be a üow network with source s and sink t , and let f be a üow in G. Let G f be the residual network of G induced by f , and let f 0 be a üow in G f . Then the function f \" f 0 deûned in equation (24.4) is a üow in G with value jf \" f 0 j D jf j C jf 0 j. Proof We ûrst verify that f \" f 0 obeys the capacity constraint for each edge in E and üow conservation at each vertex in V  fs; t g. For the capacity constraint, ûrst observe that if .u; v/ 2 E, then c f .v; u/ D f .u; v/. Because f 0 is a üow in G f , we have f 0 .v; u/ හ c f .v; u/, which gives f 0 .v; u/ හ f .u; v/. Therefore, .f \" f 0 /.u; v/ D f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/  f 0 .v; u/ (by equation (24.4))  f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/  f .u; v/ (because f 0 .v; u/ හ f .u; v/) D f 0 .u; v/  0 : In addition, .f \" f 0 /.u; v/ D f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/  f 0 .v; u/ (by equation (24.4)) හ f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/ (because üows are nonnegative) හ f .u; v/ C c f .u; v/ (capacity constraint) D f .u; v/ C c.u; v/  f .u; v/ (deûnition of c f ) D c.u; v/ : To show that üow conservation holds and that jf \" f 0 j D jf j C jf 0 j, we ûrst prove the claim that for all u 2 V , we have 680 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow X v2V .f \" f 0 /.u; v/  X v2V .f \" f 0 /.v; u/ D X v2V f .u; v/  X v2V f .v; u/ C X v2V f 0 .u; v/  X v2V f 0 .v; u/ : (24.5) Because we disallow antiparallel edges in G (but not in G f ), we know that for each vertex u, there can be an edge .u; v/ or .v; u/ in G, but never both. For a ûxed vertex u, deûne V l .u/ D fv W .u; v/ 2 Eg to be the set of vertices with edges in G leaving u, and deûne V e .u/ D fv W .v; u/ 2 Eg to be the set of vertices with edges in G entering u. We have V l .u/ [ V e .u/ ෂ V and, because G contains no antiparallel edges, V l .u/ \\ V e .u/ D ;. By the deûnition of üow augmentation in equation (24.4), only vertices v in V l .u/ can have positive .f \" f 0 /.u; v/, and only vertices v in V e .u/ can have positive .f \" f 0 /.v; u/. Starting from the left-hand side of equation (24.5), we use this fact and then reorder and group terms, giving X v2V .f \" f 0 / .u; v/  X v2V .f \" f 0 / .v; u/ D X v2V l .u/ .f \" f 0 / .u; v/  X v2V e .u/ .f \" f 0 / .v; u/ D X v2V l .u/ .f .u; v/ C f 0 .u; v/  f 0 .v; u//  X v2V e .u/ .f .v; u/ C f 0 .v; u/  f 0 .u; v// D X v2V l .u/ f .u; v/ C X v2V l .u/ f 0 .u; v/  X v2V l .u/ f 0 .v; u/  X v2V e .u/ f .v; u/  X v2V e .u/ f 0 .v; u/ C X v2V e .u/ f 0 .u; v/ D X v2V l .u/ f .u; v/  X v2V e .u/ f .v; u/ C X v2V l .u/ f 0 .u; v/ C X v2V e .u/ f 0 .u; v/  X v2V l .u/ f 0 .v; u/  X v2V e .u/ f 0 .v; u/ D X v2V l .u/ f .u; v/  X v2V e .u/ f .v; u/ C X v2V l .u/[V e .u/ f 0 .u; v/  X v2V l .u/[V e .u/ f 0 .v; u/ : (24.6) In equation (24.6), all four summations can extend to sum over V , since each additional term has value 0. (Exercise 24.2-1 asks you to prove this formally.) Taking all four summations over V , instead of just subsets of V , proves the claim in equation (24.5). Now we are ready to prove üow conservation for f \" f 0 and that jf \" f 0 j D jf j C jf 0 j. For the latter property, let u D s in equation (24.5). Then, we have 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 681 jf \" f 0 j D X v2V .f \" f 0 /.s; v/  X v2V .f \" f 0 /.v; s/ D X v2V f .s; v/  X v2V f .v; s/ C X v2V f 0 .s; v/  X v2V f 0 .v; s/ D jf j C jf 0 j : For üow conservation, observe that for any vertex u that is neither s nor t , üow conservation for f and f 0 means that the right-hand side of equation (24.5) is 0, and thus P v2V .f \" f 0 /.u; v/ D P v2V .f \" f 0 /.v; u/. Augmenting paths Given a üow network G D .V; E/ and a üow f , an augmenting path p is a simple path from s to t in the residual network G f . By the deûnition of the resid- ual network, the üow on an edge .u; v/ of an augmenting path may increase by up to c f .u; v/ without violating the capacity constraint on whichever of .u; v/ and .v; u/ belongs to the original üow network G. The blue path in Figure 24.4(b) is an augmenting path. Treating the residual network G f in the ûgure as a üow network, the üow through each edge of this path can increase by up to 4 units without violating a capacity constraint, since the smallest residual capacity on this path is c f .v 2 ; v 3 / D 4. We call the maximum amount by which we can increase the üow on each edge in an augmenting path p the residual capacity of p, given by c f .p/ D min fc f .u; v/ W .u; v/ is in pg : The following lemma, which Exercise 24.2-7 asks you to prove, makes the above argument more precise. Lemma 24.2 Let G D .V; E/ be a üow network, let f be a üow in G, and let p be an augmenting path in G f . Deûne a function f p W V  V ! R by f p .u; v/ D ( c f .p/ if .u; v/ is on p ; 0 otherwise : (24.7) Then, f p is a üow in G f with value jf p j D c f .p/ > 0. The following corollary shows that augmenting f by f p produces another üow in G whose value is closer to the maximum. Figure 24.4(c) shows the result of augmenting the üow f from Figure 24.4(a) by the üow f p in Figure 24.4(b), and Figure 24.4(d) shows the ensuing residual network. 682 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow Corollary 24.3 Let G D .V; E/ be a üow network, let f be a üow in G, and let p be an aug- menting path in G f . Let f p be deûned as in equation (24.7), and suppose that f is augmented by f p . Then the function f \" f p is a üow in G with value jf \" f p j D jf j C jf p j > jf j. Proof Immediate from Lemmas 24.1 and 24.2. Cuts of ﬂow networks The Ford-Fulkerson method repeatedly augments the üow along augmenting paths until it has found a maximum üow. How do we know that when the algorithm terminates, it has actually found a maximum üow? The max-üow min-cut theorem, which we will prove shortly, tells us that a üow is maximum if and only if its residual network contains no augmenting path. To prove this theorem, though, we must ûrst explore the notion of a cut of a üow network. A cut .S; T / of üow network G D .V; E/ is a partition of V into S and T D V  S such that s 2 S and t 2 T . (This deûnition is similar to the def- inition of <cut= that we used for minimum spanning trees in Chapter 21, except that here we are cutting a directed graph rather than an undirected graph, and we insist that s 2 S and t 2 T .) If f is a üow, then the net üow f .S; T / across the cut .S; T / is deûned to be f .S; T / D X u2S X v2T f .u; v/  X u2S X v2T f .v; u/ : (24.8) The capacity of the cut .S; T / is c.S; T / D X u2S X v2T c.u; v/ : (24.9) A minimum cut of a network is a cut whose capacity is minimum over all cuts of the network. You probably noticed that the deûnitions of üow across a cut and capacity of a cut differ in that üow counts edges going in both directions across the cut, but capacity counts only edges going from the source side of the cut toward the sink side. This asymmetry is intentional and important. The reason for this difference will become apparent later in this section. Figure 24.5 shows the cut .fs; v 1 ; v 2 g ; fv 3 ; v 4 ; t g/ in the üow network of Fig- ure 24.1(b). The net üow across this cut is f .v 1 ; v 3 / C f .v 2 ; v 4 /  f .v 3 ; v 2 / D 12 C 11  4 D 19 ; and the capacity of this cut is 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 683 s t 11/16 12/12 15/20 7/7 4 / 9 1/4 8/13 11/14 4/4 S T v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 Figure 24.5 A cut .S; T / in the üow network of Figure 24.1(b), where S D fs; v ; v 2 g and T D fv 3 ; v 4 ; t g. The vertices in S are orange, and the vertices in T are tan. The net üow across .S; T / is f .S; T / D 19, and the capacity is c.S; T / D 26. c.v 1 ; v 3 / C c.v 2 ; v 4 / D 12 C 14 D 26 : The following lemma shows that, for a given üow f , the net üow across any cut is the same, and it equals jf j, the value of the üow. Lemma 24.4 Let f be a üow in a üow network G with source s and sink t , and let .S; T / be any cut of G. Then the net üow across .S; T / is f .S; T / D jf j. Proof For any vertex u 2 V  fs; t g, rewrite the üow-conservation condition as X v2V f .u; v/  X v2V f .v; u/ D 0 : (24.10) Taking the deûnition of jf j from equation (24.1) and adding the left-hand side of equation (24.10), which equals 0, summed over all vertices in S  fs g, gives jf j D X v2V f .s; v/  X v2V f .v; s/ C X u2S fsg  X v2V f .u; v/  X v2V f .v; u/ ! : Expanding the right-hand summation and regrouping terms yields jf j D X v2V f .s; v/  X v2V f .v; s/ C X u2S fsg X v2V f .u; v/  X u2Sfsg X v2V f .v; u/ D X v2V  f .s; v/ C X u2S fsg f .u; v/ !  X v2V  f .v; s/ C X u2Sfsg f .v; u/ !

Hence, these summations cancel, yielding f j D X u2S X v2T f .u; v/  X u2S X v2T f .v; u/ D f .S; T / : A corollary to Lemma 24.4 shows how cut capacities bound the value of a üow. Corollary 24.5 The value of any üow f in a üow network G is bounded from above by the capacity of any cut of G. Proof Let .S; T / be any cut of G and let f be any üow. By Lemma 24.4 and the capacity constraint, f j D f .S; T / D X u2S X v2T f .u; v/  X u2S X v2T f .v; u/ හ X u2S X v2T f .u; v/ හ X u2S X v2T c.u; v/ D c.S; T / : Corollary 24.5 yields the immediate consequence that the value of a maximum üow in a network is bounded from above by the capacity of a minimum cut of the network. The important max-üow min-cut theorem, which we now state and prove, says that the value of a maximum üow is in fact equal to the capacity of a minimum cut. 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 685 Theorem 24.6 (Max-üow min-cut theorem) If f is a üow in a üow network G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t , then the following conditions are equivalent: 1. f is a maximum üow in G. 2. The residual network G f contains no augmenting paths. 3. jf j D c.S; T / for some cut .S; T / of G. Proof .1/ ) .2/: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that f is a maximum üow in G but that G f has an augmenting path p. Then, by Corollary 24.3, the üow found by augmenting f by f p , where f p is given by equation (24.7), is a üow in G with value strictly greater than jf j, contradicting the assumption that f is a maximum üow. .2/ ) .3/: Suppose that G f has no augmenting path, that is, that G f contains no path from s to t . Deûne S D fv 2 V W there exists a path from s to v in G f g and T D V  S . The partition .S; T / is a cut: we have s 2 S trivially and t … S because there is no path from s to t in G f . Now consider a pair of ver- tices u 2 S and v 2 T . If .u; v/ 2 E, we must have f .u; v/ D c.u; v/, since otherwise .u; v/ 2 E f , which would place v in set S . If .v; u/ 2 E, we must have f .v; u/ D 0, because otherwise c f .u; v/ D f .v; u/ would be positive and we would have .u; v/ 2 E f , which again would place v in S . Of course, if neither .u; v/ nor .v; u/ belongs to E, then f .u; v/ D f .v; u/ D 0. We thus have f .S; T / D X u2S X v2T f .u; v/  X v2T X u2S f .v; u/ D X u2S X v2T c.u; v/  X v2T X u2S 0 D c.S; T / : By Lemma 24.4, therefore, jf j D f .S; T / D c.S; T /. .3/ ) .1/: By Corollary 24.5, jf j හ c.S; T / for all cuts .S; T /. The condition jf j D c.S; T / thus implies that f is a maximum üow. The basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm Each iteration of the Ford-Fulkerson method ûnds some augmenting path p and uses p to modify the üow f . As Lemma 24.2 and Corollary 24.3 suggest, replac- ing f by f \" f p produces a new üow whose value is jf j C jf p j. The procedure FORD-FULKERSON on the next page implements the method by updating the üow 686 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow attribute .u; v/: f for each edge .u; v/ 2 E. 1 It assumes implicitly that .u; v/: f D 0 if .u; v/ … E. The procedure also assumes that the capacities c.u; v/ come with the üow network, and that c.u; v/ D 0 if .u; v/ … E. The procedure computes the residual capacity c f .u; v/ in accordance with the formula (24.2). The expres- sion c f .p/ in the code is just a temporary variable that stores the residual capacity of the path p.

Figure 24.6 shows the result of each iteration in a sample run. Lines 132 initialize the üow f to 0. The while loop of lines 338 repeatedly ûnds an augmenting path p in G f and augments üow f along p by the residual capacity c f .p/. Each residual edge in path p is either an edge in the original network or the reversal of an edge in the original network. Lines 638 update the üow in each case appropriately, adding üow when the residual edge is an original edge and subtracting it otherwise. When no augmenting paths exist, the üow f is a maximum üow. Analysis of Ford-Fulkerson The running time of FORD-FULKERSON depends on the augmenting path p and how it’s found in line 3. If the edge capacities are irrational numbers, it’s possible to choose the augmenting path so that the algorithm never terminates: the value of the üow increases with successive augmentations, but never converges to the maximum üow value. The good news is that if the algorithm ûnds the augmenting path by using a breadth-ûrst search (which we saw in Section 20.2), it runs in 1 Recall from Section 20.1 that we represent an attribute f for edge .u; v/ with the same style of notation4.u; v/: f 4that we use for an attribute of any other object. 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 687 12 4 4 4/4 4 4 16 4 s t 16 12 20 7 9 4 13 14 4 s t 4/16 4/12 20 7 4 / 9 13 4/14 4/4 s t 7 5 4 4 8 4 13 20 s t 4/16 8/12 4/20 7 4 / 9 4/13 4/14 4/4 4 10 s t 7 5 8 4 4 9 s t 8/16 8/12 8/20 7 9 4/13 4/14 4/4 (b) (a) (c) 12 4 4 4 4 4 10 4 12 2 11 2 11 8 8 9 4 4 9 8 4 4 9 8 s t 12 7 4 4 s t 8/16 8/12 15/20 7/7 9 11/13 11/14 4/4 10 19 s t 12 1 7 11 4 (d) (f) 4 9 8 4 4 15 s t 5 7 11 4 s t 12/16 12/12 19/20 7/7 9 11/13 11/14 4/4 (e) 4 8 8 3 3 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 3 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 v 4 Figure 24.6 The execution of the basic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

(c) The resulting residual network. polynomial time. Before proving this result, we obtain a simple bound for the case in which all capacities are integers and the algorithm ûnds any augmenting path. In practice, the maximum-üow problem often arises with integer capacities. If the capacities are rational numbers, an appropriate scaling transformation can make them all integers. If f  denotes a maximum üow in the transformed network, then a straightforward implementation of FORD-FULKERSON executes the while loop of lines 338 at most jf  j times, since the üow value increases by at least 1 unit in each iteration. A good implementation should perform the work done within the while loop efûciently. It should represent the üow network G D .V; E/ with the right data structure and ûnd an augmenting path by a linear-time algorithm. Let’s assume that the implementation keeps a data structure corresponding to a directed graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where E 0 D f.u; v/ W .u; v/ 2 E or .v; u/ 2 Eg. Edges in the net- work G are also edges in G 0 , making it straightforward to maintain capacities and üows in this data structure. Given a üow f on G, the edges in the residual net- work G f consist of all edges .u; v/ of G 0 such that c f .u; v/ > 0, where c f con- forms to equation (24.2). The time to ûnd a path in a residual network is there- fore O.V C E 0 / D O.E/ using either depth-ûrst search or breadth-ûrst search. Each iteration of the while loop thus takes O.E/ time, as does the initialization in lines 132, making the total running time of the FORD-FULKERSON algorithm O.E jf  j/. When the capacities are integers and the optimal üow value jf  j is small, the running time of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is good. Figure 24.7(a) shows an ex- ample of what can happen on a simple üow network for which jf  j is large. A max- imum üow in this network has value 2,000,000: 1,000,000 units of üow traverse the path s ! u ! t , and another 1,000,000 units traverse the path s ! v ! t . If the ûrst augmenting path found by FORD-FULKERSON is s ! u ! v ! t , shown 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 689 in Figure 24.7(a), the üow has value 1 after the ûrst iteration. The resulting resid- ual network appears in Figure 24.7(b). If the second iteration ûnds the augment- ing path s ! v ! u ! t , as shown in Figure 24.7(b), the üow then has value 2. Figure 24.7(c) shows the resulting residual network. If the algorithm continues al- ternately choosing the augmenting paths s ! u ! v ! t and s ! v ! u ! t , it performs a total of 2,000,000 augmentations, increasing the üow value by only 1 unit in each. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm In the example of Figure 24.7, the algorithm never chooses the augmenting path with the fewest edges. It should have. By using breadth-ûrst search to ûnd an augmenting path in the residual network, the algorithm runs in polynomial time, independent of the maximum üow value. We call the Ford-Fulkerson method so implemented the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. Let’s now prove that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm runs in O.VE 2 / time. The analysis depends on the distances to vertices in the residual network G f . The notation ı f .u; v/ denotes the shortest-path distance from u to v in G f , where each edge has unit distance. Lemma 24.7 If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a üow network G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t , then for all vertices v 2 V  fs; t g, the shortest-path distance ı f .s; v/ in the residual network G f increases monotonically with each üow augmentation. Proof We’ll suppose that a üow augmentation occurs that causes the shortest- path distance from s to some vertex v 2 V  fs; t g to decrease and then derive a contradiction. Let f be the üow just before an augmentation that decreases some shortest-path distance, and let f 0 be the üow just afterward. Let v be a vertex with the minimum ı f 0 .s; v/ whose distance was decreased by the augmentation, so that ı f 0 .s; v/ < ı f .s; v/. Let p D s ❀ u ! v be a shortest path from s to v in G f 0 , so that .u; v/ 2 E f 0 and ı f 0 .s; u/ D ı f 0 .s; v/  1 : (24.11) Because of how we chose v, we know that the distance of vertex u from the source s did not decrease, that is, f 0 .s; u/  ı f .s; u/ : (24.12) We claim that .u; v/ 62 E f . Why? If we have .u; v/ 2 E f , then we also have 690 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow ı f .s; v/ හ ı f .s; u/ C 1 (by Lemma 22.10, the triangle inequality) හ ı f 0 .s; u/ C 1 (by inequality (24.12)) D ı f 0 .s; v/ (by equation (24.11)) , which contradicts our assumption that ı f 0 .s; v/ < ı f .s; v/. How can we have .u; v/ … E f and .u; v/ 2 E f 0 ? The augmentation must have increased the üow from v to u, so that edge .v; u/ was in the augmenting path. The augmenting path was a shortest path from s to t in G f , and since any subpath of a shortest path is itself a shortest path, this augmenting path includes a shortest path from s to u in G f that has .v; u/ as its last edge. Therefore, ı f .s; v/ D ı f .s; u/  1 හ ı f 0 .s; u/  1 (by inequality (24.12)) D ı f 0 .s; v/  2 (by equation (24.11)) , so that ı f 0 .s; v/ > ı f .s; v/, contradicting our assumption that ı f 0 .s; v/ < ı f .s; v/. We conclude that our assumption that such a vertex v exists is incorrect. The next theorem bounds the number of iterations of the Edmonds-Karp algo- rithm. Theorem 24.8 If the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is run on a üow network G D .V; E/ with source s and sink t , then the total number of üow augmentations performed by the algorithm is O.VE/. Proof We say that an edge .u; v/ in a residual network G f is critical on an aug- menting path p if the residual capacity of p is the residual capacity of .u; v/, that is, if c f .p/ D c f .u; v/. After üow is augmented along an augmenting path, any critical edge on the path disappears from the residual network. Moreover, at least one edge on any augmenting path must be critical. We’ll show that each of the jEj edges can become critical at most jV j =2 times. Let u and v be vertices in V that are connected by an edge in E. Since augment- ing paths are shortest paths, when .u; v/ is critical for the ûrst time, we have ı f .s; v/ D ı f .s; u/ C 1 : Once the üow is augmented, the edge .u; v/ disappears from the residual network. It cannot reappear later on another augmenting path until after the üow from u to v is decreased, which occurs only if .v; u/ appears on an augmenting path. If f 0 is the üow in G when this event occurs, then we have ı f 0 .s; u/ D ı f 0 .s; v/ C 1 : 24.2 The Ford-Fulkerson method 691 Since ı f .s; v/ හ ı f 0 .s; v/ by Lemma 24.7, we have ı f 0 .s; u/ D ı f 0 .s; v/ C 1  ı f .s; v/ C 1 D ı f .s; u/ C 2 : Consequently, from the time .u; v/ becomes critical to the time when it next becomes critical, the distance of u from the source increases by at least 2. The distance of u from the source is initially at least 0. Because edge .u; v/ is on an augmenting path, and augmenting paths end at t , we know that u cannot be t , so that in any residual network that has a path from s to u, the shortest such path has at most jV j  2 edges. Thus, after the ûrst time that .u; v/ becomes critical, it can become critical at most .jV j  2/=2 D jV j =2  1 times more, for a total of at most jV j =2 times. Since there are O.E/ pairs of vertices that can have an edge between them in a residual network, the total number of critical edges during the entire execution of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE/. Each augmenting path has at least one critical edge, and hence the theorem follows. Because each iteration of FORD-FULKERSON takes O.E/ time when it uses breadth-ûrst search to ûnd the augmenting path, the total running time of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm is O.VE 2 /. Exercises 24.2-1 Prove that the summations in equation (24.6) equal the summations on the right- hand side of equation (24.5). 24.2-2 In Figure 24.1(b), what is the net üow across the cut .fs; v 2 ; v 4 g ; fv 1 ; v 3 ; t g/?

Of the augmenting paths appearing in the example, which one cancels üow? 692 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow 24.2-5 The construction in Section 24.1 to convert a üow network with multiple sources and sinks into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with inûnite capac- ity. Prove that any üow in the resulting network has a ûnite value if the edges of the original network with multiple sources and sinks have ûnite capacity. 24.2-6 Suppose that each source s i in a üow network with multiple sources and sinks produces exactly p i units of üow, so that P v2V f .s i ; v/ D p i . Suppose also that each sink t j consumes exactly q j units, so that P v2V f .v; t j / D q j , where P i p i D P j q j . Show how to convert the problem of ûnding a üow f that obeys these additional constraints into the problem of ûnding a maximum üow in a single- source, single-sink üow network. 24.2-7 Prove Lemma 24.2. 24.2-8 Suppose that we redeûne the residual network to disallow edges into s . Argue that the procedure FORD-FULKERSON still correctly computes a maximum üow. 24.2-9 Suppose that both f and f 0 are üows in a üow network. Does the augmented üow f \" f 0 satisfy the üow conservation property? Does it satisfy the capacity constraint? 24.2-10 Show how to ûnd a maximum üow in a üow network G D .V; E/ by a sequence of at most jEj augmenting paths. (Hint: Determine the paths after ûnding the maximum üow.) 24.2-11 The edge connectivity of an undirected graph is the minimum number k of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. For example, the edge connectivity of a tree is 1, and the edge connectivity of a cyclic chain of vertices is 2. Show how to determine the edge connectivity of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ by running a maximum-üow algorithm on at most jV j üow networks, each having O.V C E/ vertices and O.E/ edges. 24.2-12 You are given a üow network G, where G contains edges entering the source s . Let f be a üow in G with jf j  0 in which one of the edges .v; s/ entering 24.3 Maximum bipartite matching 693 the source has f .v; s/ D 1. Prove that there must exist another üow f 0 with f 0 .v; s/ D 0 such that jf j D jf 0 j. Give an O.E/-time algorithm to compute f 0 , given f and assuming that all edge capacities are integers. 24.2-13 Suppose that you wish to ûnd, among all minimum cuts in a üow network G with integer capacities, one that contains the smallest number of edges. Show how to modify the capacities of G to create a new üow network G 0 in which any minimum cut in G 0 is a minimum cut with the smallest number of edges in G. 24.3 Maximum bipartite matching Some combinatorial problems can be cast as maximum-üow problems, such as the multiple-source, multiple-sink maximum-üow problem from Section 24.1. Other combinatorial problems seem on the surface to have little to do with üow networks, but they can in fact be reduced to maximum-üow problems. This section presents one such problem: ûnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. In order to solve this problem, we’ll take advantage of an integrality property provided by the Ford-Fulkerson method. We’ll also see how to use the Ford-Fulkerson method to solve the maximum-bipartite-matching problem on a graph G D .V; E/ in O.VE/ time. Section 25.1 will present an algorithm speciûcally designed to solve this problem. The maximum-bipartite-matching problem Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, a matching is a subset of edges M ෂ E such that for all vertices v 2 V , at most one edge of M is incident on v. We say that a vertex v 2 V is matched by the matching M if some edge in M is incident on v, and otherwise, v is unmatched. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum cardinality, that is, a matching M such that for any matching M 0 , we have jM j  jM 0 j. In this section, we restrict our attention to ûnding maximum matchings in bipartite graphs: graphs in which the vertex set can be partitioned into V D L [ R, where L and R are disjoint and all edges in E go between L and R. We further assume that every vertex in V has at least one incident edge. Figure 24.8 illustrates the notion of a matching in a bipartite graph. The problem of ûnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph has many practical applications. As an example, consider matching a set L of machines with a set R of tasks to be performed simultaneously. An edge .u; v/ in E signiûes that 694 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow L R L R s t (a) (c) L R (b) Figure 24.8 A bipartite graph G D .V; E/ with vertex partition V D L [ R. (a) A matching with cardinality 2, indicated by blue edges. (b) A maximum matching with cardinality 3. (c) The corresponding üow network G 0 with a maximum üow shown. Each edge has unit capacity. Blue edges have a üow of 1, and all other edges carry no üow. The blue edges from L to R correspond to those in the maximum matching from (b). a particular machine u 2 L is capable of performing a particular task v 2 R. A maximum matching provides work for as many machines as possible. Finding a maximum bipartite matching The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a basis for ûnding a maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph G D .V; E/ in time polynomial in jV j and jEj. The trick is to construct a üow network in which üows correspond to matchings, as shown in Figure 24.8(c). We deûne the corresponding üow network G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / for the bipartite graph G as follows. Let the source s and sink t be new vertices not in V , and let V 0 D V [ fs; t g. If the vertex partition of G is V D L [ R, the directed edges of G 0 are the edges of E, directed from L to R, along with jV j new directed edges: 0 D f.s; u/ W u 2 Lg [ f.u; v/ W u 2 L; v 2 R; and .u; v/ 2 Eg [ f.v; t/ W v 2 Rg : To complete the construction, assign unit capacity to each edge in E 0 . Since each vertex in V has at least one incident edge, jEj  jV j =2. Thus, jEj හ jE 0 j D jEj C jV j හ 3 jEj, and so jE 0 j D ‚.E/. 24.3 Maximum bipartite matching 695 The following lemma shows that a matching in G corresponds directly to a üow in G’s corresponding üow network G 0 . We say that a üow f on a üow network G D .V; E/ is integer-valued if f .u; v/ is an integer for all .u; v/ 2 V  V . Lemma 24.9 Let G D .V; E/ be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V D L [ R, and let G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / be its corresponding üow network. If M is a matching in G, then there is an integer-valued üow f in G 0 with value jf j D jM j. Conversely, if f is an integer-valued üow in G 0 , then there is a matching M in G with cardinality jM j D jf j consisting of edges .u; v/ 2 E such that f .u; v/ > 0. Proof We ûrst show that a matching M in G corresponds to an integer-valued üow f in G 0 . Deûne f as follows. If .u; v/ 2 M , then f .s; u/ D f .u; v/ D f .v; t/ D 1. For all other edges .u; v/ 2 E 0 , deûne f .u; v/ D 0. It is simple to verify that f satisûes the capacity constraint and üow conservation. Intuitively, each edge .u; v/ 2 M corresponds to 1 unit of üow in G 0 that tra- verses the path s ! u ! v ! t . Moreover, the paths induced by edges in M are vertex-disjoint, except for s and t . The net üow across cut .L [ fs g ; R [ ft g/ is equal to jM j, and thus, by Lemma 24.4, the value of the üow is jf j D jM j. To prove the converse, let f be an integer-valued üow in G 0 and, as in the state- ment of the lemma, let D f.u; v/ W u 2 L; v 2 R; and f .u; v/ > 0g : Each vertex u 2 L has only one entering edge, namely .s; u/, and its capacity is 1. Thus, each u 2 L has at most 1 unit of üow entering it, and if 1 unit of üow does enter, by üow conservation, 1 unit of üow must leave. Furthermore, since the üow f is integer-valued, for each u 2 L, the 1 unit of üow can enter on at most one edge and can leave on at most one edge. Thus, 1 unit of üow enters u if and only if there is exactly one vertex v 2 R such that f .u; v/ D 1, and at most one edge leaving each u 2 L carries positive üow. A symmetric argument applies to each v 2 R. The set M is therefore a matching. To see that jM j D jf j, observe that of the edges .u; v/ 2 E 0 such that u 2 L and v 2 R, f .u; v/ D ( 1 if .u; v/ 2 M ; 0 if .u; v/ … M : Consequently, f .L [ fs g ; R [ ft g/, the net üow across cut .L [ fs g ; R [ ft g/, is equal to jM j. Lemma 24.4 gives that jf j D f .L [ fs g ; R [ ft g/ D jM j. Based on Lemma 24.9, we would like to conclude that a maximum matching in a bipartite graph G corresponds to a maximum üow in its corresponding üow 696 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow network G 0 , and therefore running a maximum-üow algorithm on G 0 provides a maximum matching in G. The only hitch in this reasoning is that the maximum- üow algorithm might return a üow in G 0 for which some f .u; v/ is not an integer, even though the üow value jf j must be an integer. The following theorem shows that the Ford-Fulkerson method cannot produce a solution with this problem. Theorem 24.10 (Integrality theorem) If the capacity function c takes on only integer values, then the maximum üow f produced by the Ford-Fulkerson method has the property that jf j is an integer. Moreover, for all vertices u and v, the value of f .u; v/ is an integer. Proof Exercise 24.3-2 asks you to provide the proof by induction on the number of iterations. We can now prove the following corollary to Lemma 24.9. Corollary 24.11 The cardinality of a maximum matching M in a bipartite graph G equals the value of a maximum üow f in its corresponding üow network G 0 . Proof We use the nomenclature from Lemma 24.9. Suppose that M is a max- imum matching in G and that the corresponding üow f in G 0 is not maximum. Then there is a maximum üow f 0 in G 0 such that jf 0 j > jf j. Since the ca- pacities in G 0 are integer-valued, by Theorem 24.10, we can assume that f 0 is integer-valued. Thus, f 0 corresponds to a matching M 0 in G with cardinality jM 0 j D jf 0 j > jf j D jM j, contradicting our assumption that M is a maximum matching. In a similar manner, we can show that if f is a maximum üow in G 0 , its corresponding matching is a maximum matching on G. Thus, to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite undirected graph G, create the üow network G 0 , run the Ford-Fulkerson method on G 0 , and convert the integer- valued maximum üow found into a maximum matching for G. Since any matching in a bipartite graph has cardinality at most min fjLj ; jRjg D O.V /, the value of the maximum üow in G 0 is O.V /. Therefore, ûnding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph takes O.VE 0 / D O.VE/ time, since jE 0 j D ‚.E/. Exercises 24.3-1 Run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on the üow network in Figure 24.8(c) and show the residual network after each üow augmentation. Number the vertices in L top Problems for Chapter 24 697 to bottom from 1 to 5 and in R top to bottom from 6 to 9. For each iteration, pick the augmenting path that is lexicographically smallest. 24.3-2 Prove Theorem 24.10. Use induction on the number of iterations of the Ford- Fulkerson method. 24.3-3 Let G D .V; E/ be a bipartite graph with vertex partition V D L [ R, and let G 0 be its corresponding üow network. Give a good upper bound on the length of any augmenting path found in G 0 during the execution of FORD-FULKERSON. Problems 24-1 Escape problem An nn grid is an undirected graph consisting of n rows and n columns of vertices, as shown in Figure 24.9. We denote the vertex in the i th row and the j th column by .i; j /. All vertices in a grid have exactly four neighbors, except for the boundary vertices, which are the points .i; j / for which i D 1, i D n, j D 1, or j D n. Given m හ n 2 starting points .x 1 ; y 1 /; .x 2 ; y 2 /; : : : ; .x m ; y m / in the grid, the escape problem is to determine whether there are m vertex-disjoint paths from the starting points to any m different points on the boundary. For example, the grid in Figure 24.9(a) has an escape, but the grid in Figure 24.9(b) does not. (a) (b) Figure 24.9 Grids for the escape problem. Starting points are blue, and other grid vertices are tan. (a) A grid with an escape, shown by blue paths. (b) A grid with no escape. 698 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow a. Consider a üow network in which vertices, as well as edges, have capacities. That is, the total positive üow entering any given vertex is subject to a capacity constraint.

Describe an efûcient algorithm to solve the escape problem, and analyze its running time. 24-2 Minimum path cover A path cover of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is a set P of vertex-disjoint paths such that every vertex in V is included in exactly one path in P . Paths may start and end anywhere, and they may be of any length, including 0. A minimum path cover of G is a path cover containing the fewest possible paths. a.

He has identiûed n important food categories, which he represents by the set C D fC 1 ; C 2 ; : : : ; C n g. In each category C k , he can hire an expert in that category for e k > 0 dollars. The consulting company has lined up a set J D fJ 1 ; J 2 ; : : : ; J m g of potential jobs. In order to perform job J i , the company needs to have hired experts in a subset R i ෂ C of categories. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simultaneously. If the company chooses to accept job J i , it must have hired experts in all categories in R i , and it takes in revenue of p i > 0 dollars. Professor Fieri’s job is to determine which categories to hire experts in and which jobs to accept in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the experts. Consider the following üow network G. It contains a source vertex s , vertices C 1 ; C 2 ; : : : ; C n , vertices J 1 ; J 2 ; : : : ; J m , and a sink vertex t . For k D 1; 2 : : : ; n, the üow network contains an edge .s; C k / with capacity c.s; C k / D e k , and for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, the üow network contains an edge .J i ; t/ with capacity Problems for Chapter 24 699 c.J i ; t/ D p i .

Suppose instead that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm chooses a widest augmenting path: an augmenting path with the greatest residual capacity. Assume that G D .V; E/ is a üow network with source s and sink t , that all capacities are integer, and that the largest capacity is C . In this problem, you will show that choosing a widest augmenting path results in at most jEj ln jf  j augmentations to ûnd a maximum üow f  . a.

Problems for Chapter 24 701 24-7 Global minimum cut A global cut in an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a partition (see page 1156) of V into two nonempty sets V 1 and V 2 . This deûnition is like the deûnition of cut that we have used in this chapter, except that we no longer have distinguished vertices s and t . Any edge .u; v/ with u 2 V 1 and v 2 V 2 is said to cross the cut. We can extend this deûnition of a cut to a multigraph G D .V; E/ (see page 1167), and we denote by c.u; v/ the number of edges in the multigraph with endpoints u and v. A global cut in a multigraph is still a partition of the vertices, and the value of a global cut .V 1 ; V 2 / is c.V 1 ; V 2 / D P u2V 1 ;v2V 2 c.u; v/. A so- lution to the global-minimum-cut problem is a cut .V 1 ; V 2 / such that c.V 1 ; V 2 / is minimum. Let �.G/ denote the value of a global minimum cut in a graph or multigraph G. a. Show how to ûnd a global minimum cut of a graph G D .V; E/ by solving ã jV j 2 ä maximum-üow problems, each with a different pair of vertices as the source and sink, and taking the mininum value of the cuts found. b. Give an algorithm to ûnd a global minimum cut by solving only ‚.V / maximum-üow problems. What is the running time of your algorithm? The remainder of this problem develops an algorithm for the global-minimum- cut problem that does not use any maximum-üow computations. It uses the notion of an edge contraction, deûned on page 1168, with one crucial difference. The algorithm maintains a multigraph, so that upon contracting an edge .u; v/, it creates a new vertex x , and for any other vertex y 2 V , the number of edges between x and y is c.u; y/ C c.v; y/. The algorithm does not maintain self-loops, and so it sets c.x; x/ to 0. Denote by G=.u; v/ the multigraph that results from contracting edge .u; v/ in multigraph G. Consider what can happen to the minimum cut when an edge is contracted. As- sume that, at all points, the minimum cut in a multigraph G is unique. We’ll remove this assumption later. c. Show that for any edge .u; v/, we have �.G=.u; v// හ �.G/. Under what conditions is �.G=.u; v// < �.G/ ? Next, you will show that if you pick an edge uniformly at random, the probability that it belongs to the minimum cut is small. d. Show that for any multigraph G D .V; E/, the value of the global minimum cut is at most the average degree of a vertex: that �.G/ හ 2 jEj = jV j, where jEj denotes the total number of edges in the multigraph. 702 Chapter 24 Maximum Flow e. Using the results from parts (c) and (d), show that, if we pick an edge .u; v/ uniformly at random, then the probability that .u; v/ belongs to the minimum cut is at most 2=V . Consider the algorithm that repeatedly chooses an edge at random and contracts it until the multigraph has exactly two vertices, say u and v. At that point, the multigraph corresponds to a cut in the original graph, with vertex u representing all the nodes in one side of the original graph, and v representing all the vertices on the other side. The number of edges given by c.u; v/ corresponds exactly to the number of edges crossing the corresponding cut in the original graph. We call this algorithm the contraction algorithm. f. Suppose that the contraction algorithm terminates with a multigraph whose only vertices are u and v. Show that Pr fc.u; v/ D �.G/g D �  1= ã jV j 2 ä ශ . g. Prove that if the contraction algorithm repeats ã jV j 2 ä ln jV j times, then the prob- ability that at least one of the runs returns the minimum cut is at least 1  1= jV j. h. Give a detailed implementation of the contraction algorithm that runs in O.V 2 / time. i. Combine the previous parts and remove the assumption that the minimum cut must be unique, to conclude that running the contraction algorithm ã jV j 2 ä ln jV j times yields an algorithm that runs in O.V 4 lg V / time and returns a minimum cut with probability at least 1  1=V . Chapter notes Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7], Even [137], Lawler [276], Papadimitriou and Stei- glitz [353], Tarjan [429], and Williamson [458] are good references for network üows and related algorithms. Schrijver [399] has written an interesting review of historical developments in the ûeld of network üows. The Ford-Fulkerson method is due to Ford and Fulkerson [149], who originated the formal study of many of the problems in the area of network üow, including the maximum-üow and bipartite-matching problems. Many early implementations of the Ford-Fulkerson method found augmenting paths using breadth-ûrst search. Edmonds and Karp [132], and independently Dinic [119], proved that this strategy yields a polynomial-time algorithm. A related idea, that of using <blocking üows,= was also ûrst developed by Dinic [119]. A class of algorithms known as push-relabel algorithms, due to Goldberg [185] and Goldberg and Tarjan [188], takes a different approach from the Ford-Fulkerson Notes for Chapter 24 703 method. Push-relabel algorithms allow üow conservation to be violated at vertices other than the source and sink as they execute. Using an idea ûrst developed by Karzonov [251], they allow a preüow in which the üow into a vertex may exceed the üow out of the vertex. Such a vertex is said to be overüowing. Initially, every edge leaving the source is ûlled to capacity, so that all neighbors of the source are overüowing. In a push-relabel algorithm, each vertex is assigned an integer height. An overüowing vertex may push üow to a neighboring vertex to which it has a residual edge provided that it is higher than the neighbor. If all residual edges from an overüowing vertex go to neighbors with equal or greater heights, then the vertex may increase its height. Once all vertices other than the sink are no longer overüowing, the preüow is not only a legal üow, but also a maximum üow. Goldberg and Tarjan [188] gave an O.V 3 /-time algorithm that uses a queue to maintain the set of overüowing vertices, as well as an algorithm that uses dynamic trees to achieve a running time of O.VE lg.V 2 =E C 2//. Several other researchers developed improved variants and implementations [9, 10, 15, 86, 87, 255, 358], the fastest of which, by King, Rao, and Tarjan [255], runs in O.VE log E=.V lg V / V / time. Another efûcient algorithm for maximum üow, by Goldberg and Rao [187], runs in O ã min ˚ V 2=3 ; E 1=2  E lg.V 2 =E C 2/ lg C ä time, where C is the maximum ca- pacity of any edge. Orlin [350] gave an algorithm in the same spirit as this algo- rithm that runs in O.VE C E 31=16 lg 2 V / time. Combining it with the algorithm of King, Rao, and Tarjan results in an O.VE/-time algorithm. A different approach to maximum üows and related problems is to use tech- niques from continuous optimization including electrical üows and interior-point methods. The ûrst breakthrough in this line of work is due to Madry [308], who gave an e O.E 10=7 /-time algorithm for unit-capacity maximum üow and bipartite maximum matching. (See Problem 3-6 on page 73 for a deûnition of e O .) There has been a series of papers in this area for matchings, maximum üows, and minimum- cost üows. The fastest algorithm to date in this line of work for maximum üow is due to Lee and Sidford [285], taking e O. p V E lg O.1/ C / time. If the capacities are not too large, this algorithm is faster than the O.VE/-time algorithm mentioned above. Another algorithm, due to Liu and Sidford [303] runs in e O.E 11=8 C 1=4 / time, where C is the maximum capacity of any edge. This algorithm does not run in polynomial time, but for small enough capacities, it is faster than the previous ones. In practice, push-relabel algorithms currently dominate algorithms based on aug- menting paths, continuous-optimization, and linear programming for the maxi- mum-üow problem [88] . 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs Many real-world problems can be modeled as ûnding matchings in an undirected graph. For an undirected graph G D .V; E/, a matching is a subset of edges M ෂ E such that every vertex in V has at most one incident edge in M . For example, consider the following scenario. You have one or more positions to ûll and several candidates to interview. According to your schedule, you are able to interview candidates at certain time slots. You ask the candidates to indi- cate the subsets of time slots at which they are available. How can you schedule the interviews so that each time slot has at most one candidate scheduled, while maximizing the number of candidates that you can interview? You can model this scenario as a matching problem on a bipartite graph in which each vertex repre- sents either a candidate or a time slot, with an edge between a candidate and a time slot if the candidate is available then. If an edge is included in the matching, that means you are scheduling a particular candidate for a particular time slot. Your goal is to ûnd a maximum matching: a matching of maximum cardinality. One of the authors of this book was faced with exactly this situation when hiring teaching assistants for a large class. He used the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm in Section 25.1 to schedule the interviews. Another application of matching is the U.S. National Resident Matching Pro- gram, in which medical students are matched to hospitals where they will be sta- tioned as medical residents. Each student ranks the hospitals by preference, and each hospital ranks the students. The goal is to assign students to hospitals so that there is never a student and a hospital that both have regrets because the student was not assigned to the hospital, yet each ranked the other higher than who or where they were assigned. This scenario is perhaps the best-known real-world example of the <stable-marriage problem,= which Section 25.2 examines. Yet another instance where matching comes into play occurs when workers must be assigned to tasks in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of the assign- ment. For each worker and each task, the worker has some quantiûed effectiveness 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 705 for that task. Assuming that there are equal numbers of workers and tasks, the goal is to ûnd a matching with the maximum total effectiveness. Such a situation is an example of an assignment problem, which Section 25.3 shows how to solve. The algorithms in this chapter ûnd matchings in bipartite graphs. As in Sec- tion 24.3, the input is an undirected graph G D .V; E/, where V D L [ R, the vertex sets L and R are disjoint, and every edge in E is incident on one vertex in L and one vertex in R. A matching, therefore, matches vertices in L with vertices in R. In some applications, the sets L and R have equal cardinality, and in other applications they need not be the same size. An undirected graph need not be bipartite for the concept of matching to ap- ply. Matching in general undirected graphs has applications in areas such as scheduling and computational chemistry. It models problems in which you want to pair up entities, represented by vertices. Two vertices are adjacent if they rep- resent compatible entities, and you need to ûnd a large set of compatible pairs. Maximum-matching and maximum-weight matching problems on general graphs can be solved by polynomial-time algorithms whose running times are similar to those for bipartite matching, but the algorithms are signiûcantly more compli- cated. Exercise 25.2-5 discusses the general version of the stable-marriage prob- lem, known as the <stable-roommates problem.= Although matching applies to general undirected graphs, this chapter deals only with bipartite graphs. 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) Section 24.3 demonstrated one way to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, by ûnding a maximum üow. This section provides a more efûcient method, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which runs in O. p V E/ time. Figure 25.1(a) shows a matching in an undirected bipartite graph. A vertex that has an incident edge in matching M is matched under M , and otherwise, it is unmatched. A maximal matching is a matching M to which no other edges can be added, that is, for every edge e 2 E  M , the edge set M [ feg fails to be a matching. A maximum matching is always maximal, but the reverse does not always hold. Many algorithms to ûnd maximum matchings, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm in- cluded, work by incrementally increasing the size of a matching. Given a match- ing M in an undirected graph G D .V; E/, an M -alternating path is a simple path whose edges alternate between being in M and being in E  M . Figure 25.1(b) de- picts an M -augmenting path (sometimes called an augmenting path with respect to M ): an M -alternating path whose ûrst and last edges belong to E  M . Since an M -augmenting path contains one more edge in E  M than in M , it must consist of an odd number of edges. 706 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 R L r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 (b) l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 R L r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 (a) l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 R L r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 (c) Figure 25.1 A bipartite graph, where V D L [ R, L D fl 1 ; l 2 ; : : : ; l 7 g, and R D fr 1 ; r 2 ; : : : ; r 8 g. (a) A matching M with cardinality 4, highlighted in blue. Matched vertices are blue, and unmatched vertices are tan. (b) The ûve edges highlighted in orange form an M -augmenting path P going between vertices l 6 and r 8 . (c) The set of edges M 0 D M ˚ P highlighted in blue is a matching containing one more edge than M and adding l 6 and r 8 to the matched vertices. This matching is not a maximum matching (see Exercise 25.1-1). Figure 25.1(c) demonstrates the following lemma, which shows that by remov- ing from matching M the edges in an M -augmenting path that belong to M and adding to M the edges in the M -augmenting path that are not in M , the result is a new matching with one more edge than M . Since a matching is a set of edges, the lemma relies on the notion of the symmetric difference of two sets: X ˚ Y D .X  Y / [ .Y  X /, that is, the elements that belong to X or Y , but not both. Alternatively, you can think of X ˚Y as .X [Y /.X \\Y /. The operator ˚ is commutative and associative. Furthermore, X ˚ X D ; and X ˚ ; D ; ˚ X D X for any set X , so that the empty set is the identity for ˚. Lemma 25.1 Let M be a matching in any undirected graph G D .V; E/, and let P be an M -augmenting path. Then the set of edges M 0 D M ˚ P is also a matching in G with jM 0 j D jM j C 1. 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 707 Proof Let P contain q edges, so that dq=2e edges belong to E  M and bq=2c edges belong to M , and let these q edges be .v 1 ; v 2 /; .v 2 ; v 3 /; : : : ; .v q ; v qC1 /. Be- cause P is an M -augmenting path, vertices v 1 and v qC1 are unmatched under M and all other vertices in P are matched. Edges .v 1 ; v 2 /; .v 3 ; v 4 /; : : : ; .v q ; v qC1 / belong to E  M , and edges .v 2 ; v 3 /; .v 4 ; v 5 /; : : : ; .v q1 ; v q / belong to M . The symmetric difference M 0 D M ˚ P reverses these roles, so that edges .v 1 ; v 2 /; .v 3 ; v 4 /; : : : ; .v q ; v qC1 / belong to M 0 and .v 2 ; v 3 /; .v 4 ; v 5 /; : : : ; .v q1 ; v q / belong to E  M 0 . Each vertex v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v q ; v qC1 is matched under M 0 , which gains one additional edge relative to M , and no other vertices or edges in G are affected by the change from M to M 0 . Hence, M 0 is a matching in G, and jM 0 j D jM j C 1. Since taking the symmetric difference of a matching M with an M -augmenting path increases the size of the matching by 1, the following corollary shows that taking the symmetric difference of M with k vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths increases the size of the matching by k. Corollary 25.2 Let M be a matching in any undirected graph G D .V; E/ and P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k be vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths. Then the set of edges M 0 D M ˚ .P [ P 2 [    [ P k / is a matching in G with jM 0 j D jM j C k. Proof Since the M -augmenting paths P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k are vertex-disjoint, we have that P 1 [P 2 [  [P k D P 1 ˚P 2 ˚  ˚P k . Because the operator ˚ is associative, we have ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k / D M ˚ .P 1 ˚ P 2 ˚    ˚ P k / D .   ..M ˚ P 1 / ˚ P 2 / ˚    ˚ P k1 / ˚ P k : A simple induction on i using Lemma 25.1 shows that M ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P i 1 / is a matching in G containing jM j C i  1 edges and that path P i is an augmenting path with respect to M ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P i 1 /. Each of these augmenting paths increases the size of the matching by 1, and so jM 0 j D jM j C k. As the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm goes from matching to matching, it will be useful to consider the symmetric difference between two matchings. Lemma 25.3 Let M and M  be matchings in graph G D .V; E/, and consider the graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where E 0 D M ˚ M  . Then, G 0 is a disjoint union of simple paths, simple cycles, and/or isolated vertices. The edges in each such simple path or simple cycle 708 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs alternate between M and M  . If jM  j > jM j, then G 0 contains at least jM  jjM j vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths. Proof Each vertex in G 0 has degree 0, 1, or 2, since at most two edges of E 0 can be incident on a vertex: at most one edge from M and at most one edge from M  . Therefore, each connected component of G 0 is either a singleton vertex, an even- length simple cycle with edges alternately in M and M  , or a simple path with edges alternately in M and M  . Since E 0 D M ˚ M  D .M [ M  /  .M \\ M  / and jM  j > jM j, the edge set E 0 must contain jM  j  jM j more edges from M  than from M . Because each cycle in G 0 has an even number of edges drawn al- ternately from M and M  , each cycle has an equal number of edges from M and M  . Therefore, the simple paths in G 0 account for there being jM  j  jM j more edges from M  than M . Each path containing a different number of edges from M and M  either starts and ends with edges from M , containing one more edge from M than from M  , or starts and ends with edges from M  , containing one more edge from M  than from M . Because E 0 contains jM  j  jM j more edges from M  than from M , there are at least jM  j  jM j paths of the latter type, and each one is an M -augmenting path. Because each vertex has at most two incident edges from E 0 , these paths must be vertex-disjoint. If an algorithm ûnds a maximum matching by incrementally increasing the size of the matching, how does it determine when to stop? The following corollary gives the answer: when there are no augmenting paths. Corollary 25.4 Matching M in graph G D .V; E/ is a maximum matching if and only if G con- tains no M -augmenting path. Proof We prove the contrapositive of both directions of the lemma statement. The contrapositive of the forward direction is straightforward. If there is an M -augmenting path P in G, then by Lemma 25.1, the matching M ˚ P contains one more edge than M , meaning that M could not be a maximum matching. To show the contrapositive of the backward direction4if M is not a maximum matching, then G contains an M -augmenting path4let M  be a maximum match- ing in Lemma 25.3, so that jM  j > jM j. Then G contains at least jM  j  jM j > 0 vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths. 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 709 We already have learned enough to create a maximum-matching algorithm that runs in O.VE/ time. Start with the matching M empty. Then repeatedly run a variant of either breadth-ûrst search or depth-ûrst search from an unmatched vertex that takes alternating paths until you ûnd another unmatched vertex. Use the resulting M -augmenting path to increase the size of M by 1. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm improves the running time to O. p V E/. The proce- dure HOPCROFT-KARP is given an undirected bipartite graph, and it uses Corol- lary 25.2 to repeatedly increase the size of the matching M it ûnds. Corol- lary 25.4 proves that the algorithm is correct, since it terminates once there are no M -augmenting paths. It remains to show that the algorithm does run in O. p V E/ time. We’ll see that the repeat loop of lines 235 iterates O. p V / times and how to implement line 3 so that it runs in O.E/ time in each iteration. HOPCROFT-KARP .G/ 1 M D ; 2 repeat 3 let P D fP 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k g be a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths 4 M D M ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k / 5 until P == ; 6 return M Let’s ûrst see how to ûnd a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M - augmenting paths in O.E/ time. There are three phases. The ûrst phase forms a directed version G M of the undirected bipartite graph G. The second phase cre- ates a directed acyclic graph H from G M via a variant of breadth-ûrst search. The third phase ûnds a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths by running a variant of depth-ûrst search on the transpose H T of H . (Recall that the transpose of a directed graph reverses the direction of each edge. Since H is acyclic, so is H T .) Given a matching M , you can think of an M -augmenting path P as starting at an unmatched vertex in L, traversing an odd number of edges, and ending at an unmatched vertex in R. The edges in P traversed from L to R must belong to E  M , and the edges in P traversed from R to L must belong to M . The ûrst phase, therefore, creates the directed graph G M by directing the edges accordingly: G M D .V; E M /, where 710 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 R L r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 (a) 0 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 3 4 5 l 1 r 2 r 3 r 7 l 4 0 l 6 0 l 2 l 3 l 5 r 1 r 4 r 5 r 6 (b) layer 0 layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 3 3 3 3 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 Figure 25.2 (a) The directed graph G M created in the ûrst phase for the undirected bipartite graph G and matching M in Figure 25.1(a). Breadth-ûrst distances from any unmatched vertex in L appear next to each vertex. (b) The dag H created from G M in the second phase. Because the smallest distance to an unmatched vertex in R is 3, vertices l 7 and r 8 , with distances greater than 3, are not in H . E M D f.l; r/ W l 2 L; r 2 R; and .l; r/ 2 E  M g (edges from L to R) [ f.r; l/ W r 2 R; l 2 L; and .l; r/ 2 M g (edges from R to L) . Figure 25.2(a) shows the graph G M for the graph G and matching M in Fig- ure 25.1(a). The dag H D .V H ; E H / created by the second phase has layers of vertices. Fig- ure 25.2(b) shows the dag H corresponding to the directed graph G M in part (a) of the ûgure. Each layer contains only vertices from L or only vertices from R, alter- nating from layer to layer. The layer that a vertex resides in is given by that vertex’s minimum breadth-ûrst distance in G M from any unmatched vertex in L. Vertices in L appear in even-numbered layers, and vertices in R appear in odd-numbered layers. Let q denote the smallest distance in G M of any unmatched vertex in R. Then, the last layer in H contains the vertices in R with distance q. Vertices whose distance exceeds q do not appear in V H . (The graph H in Figure 25.2(b) omits ver- tices l 7 and r 8 because their distances from any unmatched vertex in L exceed q D 3.) The edges in E H form a subset of E M : 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 711 E H D f.l; r/ 2 E M W r: d හ q and r: d D l: d C 1g [ f.r; l/ 2 E M W l: d හ qg ; where the attribute d of a vertex gives the vertex’s breadth-ûrst distance in G M from any unmatched vertex in L. Edges that do not go between two consecutive layers are omitted from E H . To determine the breadth-ûrst distances of vertices, run breadth-ûrst search on the graph G M , but starting from all the unmatched vertices in L. (In the BFS procedure on page 556, replace the root vertex s by the set of unmatched vertices in L.) The predecessor attributes � computed by the BFS procedure are not needed here, since H is a dag and not necessarily a tree. Every path in H from a vertex in layer 0 to an unmatched vertex in layer q corresponds to a shortest M -augmenting path in the original bipartite graph G. Just use the undirected versions of the directed edges in H . Moreover, every shortest M -augmenting path in G is present in H . The third phase identiûes a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augment- ing paths. As Figure 25.3 shows, it starts by creating the transpose H T of H . Then, for each unmatched vertex r in layer q, it performs a depth-ûrst search starting from r until it either reaches a vertex in layer 0 or has exhausted all possible paths without reaching a vertex in layer 0. Instead of maintaining discovery and ûnish times, the depth-ûrst search just needs to keep track of the predecessor attributes � in the depth-ûrst tree of each search. Upon reaching a vertex in layer 0, tracing back along the predecessors identiûes an M -augmenting path. Each vertex is searched from only when it is ûrst discovered in any search. If the search from a vertex r in layer q cannot ûnd a path of undiscovered vertices to an undiscovered vertex in layer 0, then no M -augmenting path including r goes into the maximal set. Figure 25.3 shows the result of the third phase. The ûrst depth-ûrst search starts from vertex r 1 . It identiûes the M -augmenting path h.r 1 ; l 3 /; .l 3 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 1 /i, which is highlighted in orange, and discovers vertices r 1 , l 3 , r 3 , and l 1 . The next depth-ûrst search starts from vertex r 4 . This search ûrst examines the edge .r 4 ; l 3 /, but because l 3 was already discovered, it backtracks and examines edge .r 4 ; l 5 /. From there, it continues and identiûes the M -augmenting path h.r 4 ; l 5 /; .l 5 ; r 7 /; .r 7 ; l 6 /i, which is highlighted in yellow, and discovers vertices r 4 , l 5 , r 7 , and l 6 . The depth-ûrst search from vertex r 6 gets stuck at vertices l 3 and l 5 , which have already been discovered, and so this search fails to ûnd a path of undiscovered vertices to a vertex in layer 0. There is no depth-ûrst search from vertex r 5 because it is matched, and depth-ûrst searches start from unmatched vertices. Therefore, the maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths found contains just the two M -augmenting paths .hr 1 ; l 3 /; .l 3 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 1 /i and h.r 4 ; l 5 /; .l 5 ; r 7 /; .r 7 ; l 6 /i. You might have noticed that in this example, this maximal set of two vertex- disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths is not a maximum set. The graph con- tains three vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths: h.r 1 ; l 2 /; .l 2 ; r 2 /; .r 2 ; l 1 /i, h.r 4 ; l 3 /; .l 3 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 4 /i, and h.r 6 ; l 5 /; .l 5 ; r 7 /; .r 7 ; l 6 /i. No matter: the algorithm 712 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs layer 0 layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 l 4 l 6 l 1 r 2 r 3 r 7 l 2 l 3 l 5 r 1 r 4 r 5 r 6 Figure 25.3 The transpose H T of the dag H created in the third phase. The ûrst depth-ûrst search, starting from vertex r 1 , identiûes the M -augmenting path h.r 1 ; l 3 /; .l 3 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 1 /i highlighted in orange, and it discovers vertices r 1 ; l 3 ; r 3 ; l 1 . The second depth-ûrst search, starting from vertex r 4 , identiûes the M -augmenting path h.r 4 ; l 5 /; .l 5 ; r 7 /; .r 7 ; l 6 /i highlighted in yellow, discovering vertices r 4 ; l 5 ; r 7 ; l 6 . requires the set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths found in line 3 of HOPCROFT-KARP to be only maximal, not necessarily maximum. It remains to show that all three phases of line 3 take O.E/ time. We assume that in the original bipartite graph G, each vertex has at least one incident edge so that jV j D O.E/, which in turn implies that jV jCjEj D O.E/. The ûrst phase creates the directed graph G M by simply directing each edge of G, so that jV M j D jV j and jE M j D jEj. The second phase performs a breadth-ûrst search on G M , taking O.V M C E M / D O.E M / D O.E/ time. In fact, it can stop once the ûrst distance in the queue within the breadth-ûrst search exceeds the shortest distance q to an unmatched vertex in R. The dag H has jV H j හ jV M j and jE H j හ jE M j, so that it takes O.V H C E H / D O.E/ time to construct. Finally, the third phase performs depth-ûrst searches from the unmatched vertices in layer q. Once a vertex is discovered, it is not searched from again, and so the analysis of depth-ûrst search from Section 20.3 applies here: O.V H C E H / D O.E/. Hence, all three phases take just O.E/ time. Once the maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest M -augmenting paths have been found in line 3, updating the matching in line 4 takes O.E/ time, as it is just a matter of going through the edges of the M -augmenting paths and adding edges to and removing edges from the matching M . Thus, each iteration of the repeat loop of lines 235 can run in O.E/ time. 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 713 It remains to show that the repeat loop iterates O. p V / times. We start with the following lemma, which shows that after each iteration of the repeat loop, the length of an augmenting path increases. Lemma 25.5 Let G D .V; E/ be an undirected bipartite graph with matching M , and let q be the length of a shortest M -augmenting path. Let P D fP 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k g be a maximal set of vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths of length q. Let M 0 D M ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k /, and suppose that P is a shortest M 0 -augmenting path. Then P has more than q edges. Proof We consider separately the cases in which P is vertex-disjoint from the augmenting paths in P and in which it is not vertex-disjoint. First, assume that P is vertex-disjoint from the augmenting paths in P . Then, P contains edges that are in M but are not in any of P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k , so that P is also an M -augmenting path. Since P is disjoint from P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P k but is also an M -augmenting path, and since P is a maximal set of shortest M -augmenting paths, P must be longer than any of the augmenting paths in P , each of which has length q. Therefore, P has more than q edges. Now, assume that P visits at least one vertex from the M -augmenting paths in P . By Corollary 25.2, M 0 is a matching in G with jM 0 j D jM j C k. Since P is an M 0 -augmenting path, by Lemma 25.1, M 0 ˚ P is a matching with jM 0 ˚ P j D jM 0 j C 1 D jM j C k C 1. Now let A D M ˚ M 0 ˚ P . We claim that A D .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k / ˚ P : A D M ˚ M 0 ˚ P D M ˚ .M ˚ .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k // ˚ P D .M ˚ M / ˚ .P [ P 2 [    [ P k / ˚ P (associativity of ˚) D ; ˚ .P [ P 2 [    [ P k / ˚ P (X ˚ X D ; for all X ) D .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k / ˚ P (; ˚ X D X for all X ) . Lemma 25.3 with M  D M 0 ˚ P gives that A contains at least jM 0 ˚ P j  jM j D k C 1 vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths. Since each such M -augmenting path has at least q edges, we have jAj  .k C 1/q D kq C q. Now we claim that P shares at least one edge with some M -augmenting path in P . Under the matching M 0 , every vertex in each M -augmenting path in P is matched. (Only the ûrst and last vertex in each M -augmenting path P i is un- matched under M , and under M ˚ P i , all vertices in P i are matched. Because the M -augmenting paths in P are vertex-disjoint, no other path in P can affect whether the vertices in P i are matched. That is, the vertices in P i are matched under .M ˚ P i / ˚ P j if and only if they are matched under M ˚ P i , for any other 714 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs path P j 2 P .) Suppose that P shares a vertex v with some path P i 2 P . Vertex v cannot be an endpoint of P , because the endpoints of P are unmatched under M 0 . Therefore, v has an incident edge in P that belongs to M 0 . Since any vertex has at most one incident edge in a matching, this edge must also belong to P i , thus proving the claim. Because A D .P 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k / ˚ P and P shares at least one edge with some P i 2 P , we have that jAj < jP 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k j C jP j. Thus, we have kq C q හ jAj < jP 1 [ P 2 [    [ P k j C jP j D kq C jP j ; so that q < jP j. We conclude that P contains more than q edges. The next lemma bounds the size of a maximum matching, based on the length of a shortest augmenting path. Lemma 25.6 Let M be a matching in graph G D .V; E/, and let a shortest M -augmenting path in G contain q edges. Then the size of a maximum matching in G is at most jM j C jV j =.q C 1/. Proof Let M  be a maximum matching in G. By Lemma 25.3, G contains at least jM  jjM j vertex-disjoint M -augmenting paths. Each of these paths contains at least q edges, and hence at least q C 1 vertices. Because these paths are vertex- disjoint, we have .jM  jjM j/.q C1/ හ jV j, so that jM  j හ jM jCjV j =.q C1/. The ûnal lemma bounds the number of iterations of the repeat loop of lines 235. Lemma 25.7 When the HOPCROFT-KARP procedure runs on an undirected bipartite graph G D .V; E/, the repeat loop of lines 235 iterates O. p V / times. Proof By Lemma 25.5, the length q of the shortest M -augmenting paths found in line 3 increases from iteration to iteration. After ˙p jV j  iterations, therefore, we must have q  ˙p jV j  . Consider the situation after the ûrst time line 4 executes with M -augmenting paths whose length is at least ˙p jV j  . Since the size of a matching increases by at least one edge per iteration, Lemma 25.6 implies that the number of additional iterations before achieving a maximum matching is at most jV j ˙p jV j  C 1 < jV j p jV j D p jV j : 25.1 Maximum bipartite matching (revisited) 715 Hence, the total number of loop iterations is less than 2 p jV j. Thus, we have the following bound on the running time of the HOPCROFT-KARP procedure. Theorem 25.8 The procedure HOPCROFT-KARP runs in O. p V E/ time on an undirected bipartite graph G D .V; E/. Proof By Lemma 25.7 the repeat loop iterates O. p V / times, and we have seen how to implement each iteration in O.E/ time.

How do they differ? 25.1-3 What is the advantage of searching in the transpose H T from unmatched vertices in layer q (the ûrst layer that contains an unmatched vertex in R) to layer 0 versus searching in the dag H from layer 0 to layer q? 25.1-4 Show how to bound the number of iterations of the the repeat loop of lines 235 of HOPCROFT-KARP by ˙ 3 p jV j=2  . ? 25.1-5 A perfect matching is a matching under which every vertex is matched. Let G D .V; E/ be an undirected bipartite graph with vertex partition V D L [ R, where jLj D jRj. For any X ෂ V , deûne the neighborhood of X as N.X / D fy 2 V W .x; y/ 2 E for some x 2 X g ; that is, the set of vertices adjacent to some member of X . Prove Hall’s theorem: there exists a perfect matching in G if and only if jAj හ jN.A/j for every subset A ෂ L. 716 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs 25.1-6 In a d -regular graph, every vertex has degree d . If G D .V; E/ is bipartite with vertex partition V D L [ R and also d -regular, then jLj D jRj. Use Hall’s theorem (see Exercise 25.1-5) to prove that every d -regular bipartite graph contains a perfect matching. Then use that result to prove that every d -regular bipartite graph contains d disjoint perfect matchings. 25.2 The stable-marriage problem In Section 25.1, the goal was to ûnd a maximum matching in an undirected bipartite graph. If you know that the graph G D .V; E/ with vertex partition V D L [ R is a complete bipartite graph 1 4containing an edge from every vertex in L to every vertex in R4then you can ûnd a maximum matching by a simple greedy algorithm. When a graph can have several matchings, you might want to decide which matchings are most desirable. In Section 25.3, we’ll add weights to the edges and ûnd a matching of maximum weight. In this section, we will instead add some information to each vertex in a complete bipartite graph: a ranking of the vertices in the other side. That is, each vertex in L has an ordered list of all the vertices in R, and vice-versa. To keep things simple, let’s assume that L and R each contain n vertices. The goal here is to match each vertex in L with a vertex in R in a <stable= way. This problem derives its name, the stable-marriage problem, from the notion of heterosexual marriage, viewing L as a set of women and R as a set of men. 2 Each woman ranks all the men in terms of desirability, and each man does the same with all the women. The goal is to pair up women and men (a matching) so that if a woman and a man are not matched to each other, then at least one of them prefers their assigned partner. If a woman and a man are not matched to each other but each prefers the other over their assigned partner, they form a blocking pair. A blocking pair has incen- tive to opt out of the assigned pairing and get together on their own. If that were to occur, then this pair would block the matching from being <stable.= A stable 1 The deûnition of a complete bipartite graph differs from the deûnition of complete graph given on page 1167 because in a bipartite graph, there are no edges between vertices in L and no edges between vertices in R. 2 Although marriage norms are changing, it’s traditional to view the stable-marriage problem through the lens of heterosexual marriage. 25.2 The stable-marriage problem 717 matching, therefore, is a matching that has no blocking pair. If there is a blocking pair, then the matching is unstable. Let’s look at an example with four women4Wanda, Emma, Lacey, and Karen4 and four men4Oscar, Davis, Brent, and Hank4having the following preferences: Wanda: Brent, Hank, Oscar, Davis Emma: Davis, Hank, Oscar, Brent Lacey: Brent, Davis, Hank, Oscar Karen: Brent, Hank, Davis, Oscar Oscar: Wanda, Karen, Lacey, Emma Davis: Wanda, Lacey, Karen, Emma Brent: Lacey, Karen, Wanda, Emma Hank: Lacey, Wanda, Emma, Karen A stable matching comprises the following pairs: Lacey and Brent Wanda and Hank Karen and Davis Emma and Oscar You can verify that this matching has no blocking pair. For example, even though Karen prefers Brent and Hank to her partner Davis, Brent prefers his partner Lacey to Karen, and Hank prefers his partner Wanda to Karen, so that neither Karen and Brent nor Karen and Hank form a blocking pair. In fact, this stable matching is unique. Suppose instead that the last two pairs were Emma and Davis Karen and Oscar Then Karen and Davis would be a blocking pair, because they were not paired to- gether, Karen prefers Davis to Oscar, and Davis prefers Karen to Emma. Therefore, this matching is not stable. Stable matchings need not be unique. For example, suppose that there are three women4Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel4and three men4Chandler, Joey, and Ross 4with these preferences: Monica: Chandler, Joey, Ross Phoebe: Joey, Ross, Chandler Rachel: Ross, Chandler, Joey Chandler: Phoebe, Rachel, Monica Joey: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe Ross: Monica, Phoebe, Rachel 718 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs In this case, there are three stable matchings: Matching 1 Monica and Chandler Phoebe and Joey Rachel and Ross Matching 2 Phoebe and Chandler Rachel and Joey Monica and Ross Matching 3 Rachel and Chandler Monica and Joey Phoebe and Ross In matching 1, all women get their ûrst choice and all men get their last choice. Matching 2 is the opposite, with all men getting their ûrst choice and all women getting their last choice. When all the women or all the men get their ûrst choice, there plainly cannot be a blocking pair. In matching 3, everyone gets their second choice. You can verify that there are no blocking pairs. You might wonder whether it is always possible to come up with a stable match- ing no matter what rankings each participant provides. The answer is yes. (Ex- ercise 25.2-3 asks you to show that even in the scenario of the National Resident Matching Program, where each hospital takes on multiple students, it is always possible to devise a stable assignment.) A simple algorithm known as the Gale- Shapley algorithm always ûnds a stable matching. The algorithm has two variants, which mirror each other: <woman-oriented= and <man-oriented.= Let’s examine the woman-oriented version. Each participant is either <free= or <engaged.= Ev- eryone starts out free. Engagements occur when a free woman proposes to a man. When a man is ûrst proposed to, he goes from free to engaged, and he always stays engaged, though not necessarily to the same woman. If an engaged man receives a proposal from a woman whom he prefers to the woman he’s currently engaged to, that engagement is broken, the woman to whom he had been engaged becomes free, and the man and the woman whom he prefers become engaged. Each woman proposes to the men in her preference list, in order, until the last time she becomes engaged. When a woman is engaged, she temporarily stops proposing, but if she becomes free again, she continues down her list. Once everyone is engaged, the algorithm terminates. The procedure GALE-SHAPLEY on the next page makes this process more concrete. The procedure allows for some choice: any free woman may be selected in line 2. We’ll see that the procedure produces a stable matching regardless of the order in which line 2 chooses free women. For the man-oriented version, just reverse the roles of men and women in the procedure. Let’s see how the GALE-SHAPLEY procedure executes on the example with Wanda, Emma, Lacey, Karen, Oscar, Davis, Brent, and Hank. After everyone is initialized to free, here is one possible version of what can occur in successive iterations of the while loop of lines 2–9: 1. Wanda proposes to Brent. Brent is free, so that Wanda and Brent become engaged and no longer free. 25.2 The stable-marriage problem 719 GALE-SHAPLEY .men; women; rankings/ 1 assign each woman and man as free 2 while some woman w is free 3 let m be the ûrst man on w’s ranked list to whom she has not proposed 4 if m is free 5 w and m become engaged to each other (and not free) 6 elseif m ranks w higher than the woman w 0 he is currently engaged to 7 m breaks the engagement to w 0 , who becomes free 8 w and m become engaged to each other (and not free) 9 else m rejects w, with w remaining free 10 return the stable matching consisting of the engaged pairs 2. Emma proposes to Davis. Davis is free, so that Emma and Davis become engaged and no longer free. 3. Lacey proposes to Brent. Brent is engaged to Wanda, but he prefers Lacey. Brent breaks the engagement to Wanda, who becomes free. Lacey and Brent become engaged, with Lacey no longer free. 4. Karen proposes to Brent. Brent is engaged to Lacey, whom he prefers to Karen. Brent rejects Karen, who remains free. 5. Karen proposes to Hank. Hank is free, so that Karen and Hank become engaged and no longer free. 6. Wanda proposes to Hank. Hank is engaged to Karen, but he prefers Wanda. Hank breaks the engagement with Karen, who becomes free. Wanda and Hank become engaged, with Wanda no longer free. 7. Karen proposes to Davis. Davis is engaged to Emma, but he prefers Karen. Davis breaks the engagement to Emma, who becomes free. Karen and Davis become engaged, with Karen no longer free. 8. Emma proposes to Hank. Hank is engaged to Wanda, whom he prefers to Emma. Hank rejects Emma, who remains free. 9. Emma proposes to Oscar. Oscar is free, so that Emma and Oscar become en- gaged and no longer free. At this point, everyone is engaged and nobody is free, so the while loop terminates. The procedure returns the stable matching we saw earlier. The following theorem shows that not only does GALE-SHAPLEY terminate, but that it always returns a stable matching, thereby proving that a stable matching always exists. 720 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs Theorem 25.9 The procedure GALE-SHAPLEY always terminates and returns a stable matching. Proof Let’s ûrst show that the while loop of lines 2–9 always terminates, so that the procedure terminates. The proof is by contradiction. If the loop fails to terminate, it is because some woman remains free. In order for a woman to remain free, she must have proposed to all the men and been rejected by each one. In order for a man to reject a woman, he must be already engaged. Therefore, all the men are engaged. Once engaged, a man stays engaged (though not necessarily to the same woman). There are an equal number n of women and men, however, which means that every woman is engaged, leading to the contradiction that no women are free. We must also show that the while loop makes a bounded number of iterations. Since each of the n women goes through her ranking of the n men in order, possibly not reaching the end of her list, the total number of iterations is at most n 2 . Therefore, the while loop always terminates, and the procedure returns a matching. We need to show that there are no blocking pairs. We ûrst observe that once a man m is engaged to a woman w, all subsequent actions for m occur in lines 638. Therefore, once a man is engaged, he stays engaged, and any time he breaks an engagement to a woman w, it’s for a woman whom he prefers to w. Suppose that a woman w is matched with a man m, but she prefers man m 0 . We’ll show that w and m 0 is not a blocking pair, because m 0 does not prefer w to his partner. Because w ranks m 0 higher than m, she must have proposed to m 0 before proposing to m, and m 0 either rejected her proposal or accepted it and later broke the engagement. If m 0 rejected the proposal from w, it is because he was already engaged to some woman he prefers to w. If m 0 accepted and later broke the engagement, he was at some point engaged to w but later accepted a proposal from a woman he prefers to w. In either case, he ultimately ends up with a partner whom he prefers to w. We conclude that even though w might prefer m 0 to her partner m, it is not also the case that m 0 prefers w to his partner. Therefore, the procedure returns a matching containing no blocking pairs. Exercise 25.2-1 asks you to provide the proof of the following corollary. Corollary 25.10 Given preference rankings for n women and n men, the Gale-Shapley algorithm can be implemented to run in O.n 2 / time. Because line 2 can choose any free woman, you might wonder whether different choices can produce different stable matchings. The answer is no: as the following 25.2 The stable-marriage problem 721 theorem shows, every execution of the GALE-SHAPLEY produces exactly the same result. Moreover, the stable matching returned is optimal for the women. Theorem 25.11 Regardless of how women are chosen in line 2 of G ALE-SHAPLEY, the procedure always returns the same stable matching, and in this stable matching, each woman has the best partner possible in any stable matching. Proof The proof that each woman has the best partner possible in any stable matching is by contradiction. Suppose that the GALE-SHAPLEY procedure returns a stable matching M , but that there is a different stable matching M 0 in which some woman w prefers her partner m 0 to the partner m she has in M . Because w ranks m 0 higher than m, she must have proposed to m 0 before proposing to m. Then there is a woman w 0 whom m 0 prefers to w, and m 0 was already engaged to w 0 when w proposed or m 0 accepted the proposal from w and later broke the engagement in favor of w 0 . Either way, there is a moment when m 0 decided against w in favor of w 0 . Now suppose, without loss of generality, that this moment was the ûrst time that any man rejected a partner who belongs to some stable matching. We claim that w 0 cannot have a partner m 00 in a stable matching whom she prefers to m 0 . If there were such a man m 00 , then in order for w 0 to propose to m 0 , she would have proposed to m 00 and been rejected at some point before proposing to m 0 . If m 0 accepted the proposal from w and later broke it to accept w 0 , then since this was the ûrst rejection in a stable matching, we get the contradiction that m 00 could not have rejected w 0 beforehand. If m 0 was already engaged to w 0 when w proposed, then again, m 00 could not have rejected w 0 beforehand, thus proving the claim. Since w 0 does not prefer anyone to m 0 in a stable matching and w 0 is not matched with m 0 in M 0 (because m 0 is matched with w in M 0 ), w 0 prefers m 0 to her partner in M 0 . Since w 0 prefers m 0 over her partner in M 0 and m 0 prefers w 0 over his partner w in M 0 , the pair w 0 and m 0 is a blocking pair in M 0 . Because M 0 has a blocking pair, it cannot be a stable matching, thereby contradicting the assumption that there exists some stable matching in which each woman has the best partner possible other than the matching M returned by GALE-SHAPLEY. We put no condition on the execution of the procedure, which means that all possible orders in which line 2 selects women result in the same stable matching being returned. Corollary 25.12 There can be stable matchings that the GALE-SHAPLEY procedure does not return. Proof Theorem 25.11 says that for a given set of rankings, G ALE-SHAPLEY re- turns just one matching, no matter how it chooses women in line 2. The earlier ex- 722 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs ample of three women and three men with three different stable matchings shows that there can be multiple stable matchings for a given set of rankings. A call of GALE-SHAPLEY is capable of returning only one of these stable matchings. Although the GALE-SHAPLEY procedure gives the best possible outcome for the women, the following corollary shows that it also produces the worst possible outcome for the men. Corollary 25.13 In the stable matching returned by the procedure GALE-SHAPLEY, each man has the worst partner possible in any stable matching. Proof Let M be the matching returned by a call to GALE-SHAPLEY. Suppose that there is another stable matching M 0 and a man m who prefers his partner w in M to his partner w 0 in M 0 . Let the partner of w in M 0 be m 0 . By Theorem 25.11, m is the best partner that w can have in any stable matching, which means that w prefers m to m 0 . Since m prefers w to w 0 , the pair w and m is a blocking pair in M 0 , contradicting the assumption that M 0 is a stable matching. Exercises 25.2-1 Describe how to implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm so that it runs in O.n 2 / time. 25.2-2 Is it possible to have an unstable matching with just two women and two men? If so, provide and justify an example. If not, argue why not. 25.2-3 The National Resident Matching Program differs from the scenario for the stable- marriage problem set out in this section in two ways. First, a hospital may be matched with more than one student, so that hospital h takes r h  1 students. Second, the number of students might not equal the number of hospitals. Describe how to modify the Gale-Shapley algorithm to ût the requirements of the National Resident Matching Program. 25.2-4 Prove the following property, which is known as weak Pareto optimality: Let M be the stable matching produced by the G ALE-SHAPLEY procedure, with women proposing to men. Then, for a given instance of the stable- marriage problem there is no matching4stable or unstable4such that every 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem 723 woman has a partner whom she prefers to her partner in the stable match- ing M . 25.2-5 The stable-roommates problem is similar to the stable-marriage problem, except that the graph is a complete graph, not bipartite, with an even number of ver- tices. Each vertex represents a person, and each person ranks all the other peo- ple. The deûnitions of blocking pairs and stable matching extend in the natural way: a blocking pair comprises two people who both prefer each other to their current partner, and a matching is stable if there are no blocking pairs. For exam- ple, consider four people4Wendy, Xenia, Yolanda, and Zelda4with the following preference lists: Wendy: Xenia, Yolanda, Zelda Xenia: Wendy, Zelda, Yolanda Yolanda: Wendy, Zelda, Xenia Zelda: Xenia, Yolanda, Wendy You can verify that the following matching is stable: Wendy and Xenia Yolanda and Zelda Unlike the stable-marriage problem, the stable-roommates problem can have inputs for which no stable matching exists. Find such an input and explain why no stable matching exists. 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem Let us once again add some information to a complete bipartite graph G D .V; E/, where V D L [ R. This time, instead of having the vertices of each side rank the vertices on the other side, we assign a weight to each edge. Again, let’s assume that the vertex sets L and R each contain n vertices, so that the graph contains n 2 edges. For l 2 L and r 2 R, denote the weight of edge .l; r/ by w.l; r/, which represents the utility gained by matching vertex l with vertex r . The goal is to ûnd a perfect matching M  (see Exercises 25.1-5 and 25.1-6) whose edges have the maximum total weight over all perfect matchings. That is, letting w.M / D P .l;r/2M w.l; r/ denote the total weight of the edges in match- ing M , we want to ûnd a perfect matching M  such that w.M  / D max fw.M / W M is a perfect matchingg : 724 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs We call ûnding such a maximum-weight perfect matching the assignment prob- lem. A solution to the assignment problem is a perfect matching that maximizes the total utility. Like the stable-marriage problem, the assignment problem ûnds a matching that is <good,= but with a different deûnition of good: maximizing total value rather than achieving stability. Although you could enumerate all nŠ perfect matchings to solve the assignment problem, an algorithm known as the Hungarian algorithm solves it much faster. This section will prove an O.n 4 / time bound, and Problem 25-2 asks you to reûne the algorithm to reduce the running time to O.n 3 /. Instead of working with the complete bipartite graph G, the Hungarian algorithm works with a subgraph of G called the <equality subgraph.= The equality subgraph, which is deûned below, changes over time and has the beneûcial property that any perfect matching in the equality subgraph is also an optimal solution to the assignment problem. The equality subgraph depends on assigning an attribute h to each vertex. We call h the label of a vertex, and we say that h is a feasible vertex labeling of G if l: h C r: h  w.l; r/ for all l 2 L and r 2 R : A feasible vertex labeling always exists, such as the default vertex labeling given by l: h D max fw.l; r/ W r 2 Rg for all l 2 L , (25.1) r: h D 0 for all r 2 R . (25.2) Given a feasible vertex labeling h, the equality subgraph G h D .V; E h / of G consists of the same vertices as G and the subset of edges E h D f.l; r/ 2 E W l: h C r: h D w.l; r/g : The following theorem ties together a perfect matching in an equality subgraph and an optimal solution to the assignment problem. Theorem 25.14 Let G D .V; E/, where V D L [ R, be a complete bipartite graph where each edge .l; r/ 2 E has weight w.l; r/. Let h be a feasible vertex labeling of G and G h be the equality subgraph of G. If G h contains a perfect matching M  , then M  is an optimal solution to the assignment problem on G. Proof If G h contains a perfect matching M  , then because G h and G have the same sets of vertices, M  is also a perfect matching in G. Because each edge of M  belongs to G h and each vertex has exactly one incident edge from any perfect matching, we have 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem 725 w.M  / D X .l;r/2M  w.l; r/ D X .l;r/2M  .l: h C r: h/ (because all edges in M  belong to G h ) D X l 2L l: h C X r 2R r: h (because M  is a perfect matching) . Letting M be any perfect matching in G, we have w.M / D X .l;r/2M w.l; r/ හ X .l;r/2M .l: h C r: h/ (because h is a feasible vertex labeling) D X l 2L l: h C X r 2R r: h (because M is a perfect matching) . Thus, we have w.M / හ X l 2L l: h C X r 2R r: h D w.M  / ; (25.3) so that M  is a maximum-weight perfect matching in G. The goal now becomes ûnding a perfect matching in an equality subgraph. Which equality subgraph? It does not matter! We have free rein to not only choose an equality subgraph, but to change which equality subgraph we choose as we go along. We just need to ûnd some perfect matching in some equality subgraph. To understand the equality subgraph better, consider again the proof of Theo- rem 25.14 and, in the second half, let M be any matching. The proof is still valid, in particular, inequality (25.3): the weight of any matching is always at most the sum of the vertex labels. If we choose any set of vertex labels that deûne an equality subgraph, then a maximum-cardinality matching in this equality subgraph has total value at most the sum of the vertex labels. If the set of vertex labels is the <right= one, then it will have total value equal to w.M  /, and a maximum-cardinality matching in the equality subgraph is also a maximum-weight perfect matching. The Hungarian algorithm repeatedly modiûes the matching and the vertex labels in order to achieve this goal. The Hungarian algorithm starts with any feasible vertex labeling h and any matching M in the equality subgraph G h . It repeatedly ûnds an M -augmenting path P in G h and, using Lemma 25.1, updates the matching to be M ˚ P , thereby incrementing the size of the matching. As long as there is some equality subgraph that contains an M -augmenting path, the size of the matching can increase, until a perfect matching is achieved. 726 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs Four questions arise: 1. What initial feasible vertex labeling should the algorithm start with? Answer: the default vertex labeling given by equations (25.1) and (25.2). 2. What initial matching in G h should the algorithm start with? Short answer: any matching, even an empty matching, but a greedy maximal matching works well. 3. If an M -augmenting path exists in G h , how to ûnd it? Short answer: use a variant of breadth-ûrst search similar to the second phase of the procedure used in the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to ûnd a maximal set of shortest M -augmenting paths. 4. What if the search for an M -augmenting path fails? Short answer: update the feasible vertex labeling to bring in at least one new edge. We’ll elaborate on the short answers using the example that starts in Figure 25.4. Here, L D fl 1 ; l 2 ; : : : ; l 7 g and R D fr 1 ; r 2 ; : : : ; r 7 g. The edge weights appear in the matrix shown in part (a), where the weight w.l i ; r j / appears in row i and column j . The feasible vertex labels, given by the default vertex labeling, appear to the left of and above the matrix. Matrix entries in red indicate edges .l i ; r j / for which l i : h C r j : h D w.l i ; r j /, that is, edges in the equality subgraph G h appearing in part (b) of the ûgure. Greedy maximal bipartite matching There are several ways to implement a greedy method to ûnd a maximal bipartite matching. The procedure GREEDY-BIPARTITE-MATCHING shows one. Edges in Figure 25.4(b) highlighted in blue indicate the initial greedy maximal matching in G h . Exercise 25.3-2 asks you to show that the GREEDY-BIPARTITE-MATCHING procedure returns a matching that is at least half the size of a maximum matching.

Finding an M -augmenting path in G h To ûnd an M -augmenting path in the equality subgraph G h with a matching M , the Hungarian algorithm ûrst creates the directed equality subgraph G M;h from G h , just as the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm creates G M from G. As in the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, you can think of an M -augmenting path as starting from an unmatched vertex in L, ending at an unmatched vertex in R, taking unmatched edges from L to R, and taking matched edges from R to L. Thus, G M;h D .V; E M;h /, where E M;h D f.l; r/ W l 2 L; r 2 R; and .l; r/ 2 E h  M g (edges from L to R) [ f.r; l/ W r 2 R; l 2 L; and .l; r/ 2 M g (edges from R to L) . Because an M -augmenting path in the directed equality subgraph G M:h is also an M -augmenting path in the equality subgraph G h , it sufûces to ûnd M -augmenting paths in G M:h . Figure 25.4(c) shows the directed equality subgraph G M;h corre- sponding to the equality subgraph G h and matching M from part (b) of the ûgure. 728 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs With the directed equality subgraph G M;h in hand, the Hungarian algorithm searches for an M -augmenting path from any unmatched vertex in L to any un- matched vertex in R. Any exhaustive graph-search method sufûces. Here, we’ll use breadth-ûrst search, starting from all the unmatched vertices in L (just as the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm does when creating the dag H ), but stopping upon ûrst discovering some unmatched vertex in R. Figure 25.5 shows the idea. To start from all the unmatched vertices in L, initialize the ûrst-in, ûrst-out queue with all the unmatched vertices in L, rather than just one source vertex. Unlike the dag H in the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, here each vertex needs just one predecessor, so that the breadth-ûrst search creates a breadth-ûrst forest F D .V F ; E F /. Each unmatched vertex in L is a root in F . In Figure 25.5(g), the breadth-ûrst search has found the M -augmenting path h.l 4 ; r 2 /; .r 2 ; l 1 /; .l 1 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 6 /; .l 6 ; r 5 /i. Figure 25.6(a) shows the new matching created by taking the symmetric difference of the matching M in Figure 25.5(a) with this M -augmenting path. When the search for an M -augmenting path fails Having updated the matching M from an M -augmenting path, the Hungarian algo- rithm updates the directed equality subgraph G M;h according to the new matching and then starts a new breadth-ûrst search from all the unmatched vertices in L. Figure 25.6 shows the start of this process, picking up from Figure 25.5. In Figure 25.6(d), the queue contains vertices l 4 and l 3 . Neither of these vertices has an edge that leaves it, however, so that once these vertices are removed from the queue, the queue becomes empty. The search terminates at this point, before discovering an unmatched vertex in R to yield an M -augmenting path. When- ever this situation occurs, the most recently discovered vertices must belong to L. Why? Whenever an unmatched vertex in R is discovered, the search has found an M -augmenting path, and when a matched vertex in R is discovered, it has an unvisited neighbor in L, which the search can then discover. Recall that we have the freedom to work with any equality subgraph. We can change the directed equality subgraph <on the üy,= as long we do not counteract the work already done. The Hungarian algorithm updates the feasible vertex labeling h to fulûll the following criteria: 1. No edge in the breadth-ûrst forest F leaves the directed equality subgraph. 2. No edge in the matching M leaves the directed equality subgraph. 3. At least one edge .l; r/, where l 2 L \\ V F and r 2 R  V F goes into E h , and hence into E M;h . Therefore, at least one vertex in R will be newly discovered. Thus, at least one new edge enters the directed equality subgraph, and any edge that leaves the directed equality subgraph belongs to neither the matching M nor 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem 729 l 4 l 5 l 7 r 7 l 3 r 2 l 1 r 3 r 4 l 6 r 5 l 2 (g) l 4 l 5 l 7 (b) l 4 l 5 l 7 r 7 r 2 (c) l 4 l 5 l 7 r 7 l 3 r 2 l 1 (d) l 4 l 5 l 7 r 7 l 3 r 2 l 1 r 3 r 4 (e) l 4 l 5 l 7 r 7 l 3 r 2 l 1 r 3 r 4 l 6 l 2 (f) R L l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 G M,h (a) Figure 25.5 Finding an M -augmenting path in G M;h by breadth-ûrst search.

In parts (b)–(f), the layer of vertices closest to the bottom of the ûgure are those in the ûrst- in, ûrst-out queue. For example, in part (b), the queue contains the roots hl 4 ; l 5 ; l 7 i, and in part (e), the queue contains hr 3 ; r 4 i, at distance 3 from the roots. In part (g), the unmatched vertex r 5 is dis- covered, so the breadth-ûrst search terminates.

Taking its symmetric difference with the matching M yields a new matching with one more edge than M . 730 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs R L l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 G M,h (a) l 5 l 7 (b) l 5 l 7 (c) r 2 r 7 l 5 l 7 (d) r 2 r 7 l 4 l 3 Figure 25.6 (a) The new matching M and the new directed equality subgraph G M:h after updating the matching in Figure 25.5(a) with the M -augmenting path in Figure 25.5(g). (b)–(d) Successive versions of the breadth-ûrst forest F in a new breadth-ûrst search with roots l 5 and l 7 . After the vertices l 4 and l 3 in part (d) have been removed from the queue, the queue becomes empty before the search can discover an unmatched vertex in R. the breadth-ûrst forest F . Newly discovered vertices in R are enqueued, but their distances are not necessarily 1 greater than the distances of the most recently dis- covered vertices in L. To update the feasible vertex labeling, the Hungarian algorithm ûrst computes the value D min fl: h C r: h  w.l; r/ W l 2 F L and r 2 R  F R g ; (25.4) where F L D L \\ V F and F R D R \\ V F denote the vertices in the breadth-ûrst forest F that belong to L and R, respectively. That is, ı is the smallest difference by which an edge incident on a vertex in F L missed being in the current equality subgraph G h . The Hungarian algorithm then creates a new feasible vertex labeling, say h 0 , by subtracting ı from l: h for all vertices l 2 F L and adding ı to r: h for all vertices r 2 F R : v: h 0 D Ĩ v: h  ı if v 2 F L ; v: h C ı if v 2 F R ; v: h otherwise (v 2 V  V F ) : (25.5) 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem 731 The following lemma shows that these changes achieve the three criteria above. Lemma 25.15 Let h be a feasible vertex labeling for the complete bipartite graph G with equality subgraph G h , and let M be a matching for G h and F be a breadth-ûrst forest being constructed for the directed equality subgraph G M;h . Then, the labeling h 0 in equation (25.5) is a feasible vertex labeling for G with the following properties: 1. If .u; v/ is an edge in the breadth-ûrst forest F for G M;h , then .u; v/ 2 E M;h 0 . 2. If .l; r/ belongs to the matching M for G h , then .r; l/ 2 E M;h 0 . 3. There exist vertices l 2 F L and r 2 R  F R such that .l; r/ … E M;h but .l; r/ 2 E M;h 0 . Proof We ûrst show that h 0 is a feasible vertex labeling for G. Because h is a feasible vertex labeling, we have l: h C r: h  w.l; r/ for all l 2 L and r 2 R. In order for h 0 to not be a feasible vertex labeling, we would need l: h 0 C r: h 0 < l: h C r: h for some l 2 L and r 2 R. The only way this could occur would be for some l 2 F L and r 2 R  F R . In this instance, the amount of the decrease equals ı , so that l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h  ı C r: h. By equation (25.4), we have that l: h ı Cr: h  w.l; r/ for any l 2 F L and r 2 R F R , so that l: h 0 Cr: h 0  w.l; r/. For all other edges, we have l: h 0 C r: h 0  l: h C r: h  w.l; r/. Thus, h 0 is a feasible vertex labeling. Now we show that each of the three desired properties holds: 1. If l 2 F L and r 2 F R , then we have l: h 0 Cr: h 0 D l: h Cr: h because ı is added to the label of l and subtracted from the label of r . Therefore, if an edge belongs to F for the directed graph G M;h , it also belongs to G M;h 0 . 2. We claim that at the time the Hungarian algorithm computes the new feasible vertex labeling h 0 , for every edge .l; r/ 2 M , we have l 2 F L if and only if r 2 F R . To see why, consider a matched vertex r and let .l; r/ 2 M . First suppose that r 2 F R , so that the search discovered r and enqueued it. When r was removed from the queue, l was discovered, so l 2 F L . Now suppose that r … F R , so r is undiscovered. We will show that l … F L . The only edge in G M;h that enters l is .r; l/, and since r is undiscovered, the search has not taken this edge; if l 2 F L , it is not because of the edge .r; l/. The only other way that a vertex in L can be in F L is if it is a root of the search, but only unmatched vertices in L are roots and l is matched. Thus, l … F L , and the claim is proved. We already saw that l 2 F L and r 2 F R implies l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h C r: h. For the opposite case, when l 2 L  F L and R 2 R  F R , we have that l: h 0 D l: h and r: h 0 D r: h, so that again l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h C r: h. Thus, if edge .l; r/ is in the matching M for the equality graph G h , then .r; l/ 2 E M;h 0 . 732 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs 3. Let .l; r/ be an edge not in E h such that l 2 F L , r 2 R  F R , and ı D l: h C r: h  w.l; r/. By the deûnition of ı , there is at least one such edge. Then, we have l: h 0 C r: h 0 D l: h  ı C r: h D l: h  .l: h C r: h  w.l; r// C r: h D w.l; r/ ; and thus .l; r/ 2 E h 0 . Since .l; r/ is not in E h , it is not in the matching M , so that in E M;h 0 it must be directed from L to R. Thus, .l; r/ 2 E M;h 0 . It is possible for an edge to belong to E M;h but not to E M;h 0 . By Lemma 25.15, any such edge belongs neither to the matching M nor to the breadth-ûrst forest F at the time that the new feasible vertex labeling h 0 is computed. (See Exercise 25.3-3.) Going back to Figure 25.6(d), the queue became empty before an M -augmenting path was found. Figure 25.7 shows the next steps taken by the algorithm. The value of ı D 1 is achieved by the edge .l 5 ; r 3 / because in Figure 25.4(a), l 5 : h C r 3 : h  w.l 5 ; r 3 / D 6 C 0  5 D 1. In Figure 25.7(a), the values of l 3 : h, l 4 : h, l 5 : h, and l 7 : h have decreased by 1 and the values of r 2 : h and r 7 : h have increased by 1 because these vertices are in F . As a result, the edges .l 1 ; r 2 / and .l 6 ; r 7 / leave G M;h and the edge .l 5 ; r 3 / enters. Figure 25.7(b) shows the new directed equality subgraph G M;h . With edge .l 5 ; r 3 / now in G M;h , Figure 25.7(c) shows that this edge is added to the breadth-ûrst forest F , and r 3 is added to the queue. Parts (c)3(f) show the breadth-ûrst forest continuing to be built until in part (f), the queue once again becomes empty after vertex l 2 , which has no edges leaving, is removed. Again, the algorithm must update the feasible vertex labeling and the directed equality subgraph. Now the value of ı D 1 is achieved by three edges: .l 1 ; r 6 /, .l 5 ; r 6 /, and .l 7 ; r 6 /. As Figure 25.8 shows in parts (a) and (b), these edges enter G M;h , and edge .l 6 ; r 3 / leaves. Part (c) shows that edge .l 1 ; r 6 / is added to the breadth- ûrst forest. (Either of edges .l 5 ; r 6 / or .l 7 ; r 6 / could have been added in- stead.) Because r 6 is unmatched, the search has found the M -augmenting path h.l 5 ; r 3 /; .r 3 ; l 1 /; .l 1 ; r 6 /i, highlighted in orange. Figure 25.9(a) shows G M;h after the matching M has been updated by tak- ing its symmetric difference with the M -augmenting path. The Hungarian al- gorithm starts its last breadth-ûrst search, with vertex l 7 as the only root. The search proceeds as shown in parts (b)3(h) of the ûgure, until the queue becomes empty after removing l 4 . This time, we ûnd that ı D 2, achieved by the ûve edges .l 2 ; r 5 /, .l 3 ; r 1 /, .l 4 ; r 5 /, .l 5 ; r 1 /, and .l 5 ; r 5 /, each of which enters G M;h .

Part (c) shows that edge .l 3 ; r 1 / is added to the breadth-ûrst forest. Since r 1 is an unmatched vertex, the search terminates, having found the M -augmenting path h.l 7 ; r 7 /; .r 7 ; l 3 /; .l 3 ; r 1 /i, highlighted in orange. If r 1 had been matched, vertex r 5 would also have been added to the breadth-ûrst forest, with any of l 2 , l 4 , or l 5 as its parent. After updating the matching M , the algorithm arrives at the perfect matching shown for the equality subgraph G h in Figure 25.11. By Theorem 25.14, the edges in M form an optimal solution to the original assignment problem given in the matrix. Here, the weights of edges .l 1 ; r 6 /, .l 2 ; r 4 /, .l 3 ; r 1 /, .l 4 ; r 2 /, .l 5 ; r 3 /, .l 6 ; r 5 /, and .l 7 ; r 7 / sum to 65, which is the maximum weight of any matching. The weight of the maximum-weight matching equals the sum of all the feasible vertex labels.

Section 29.3 explores duality in more depth. The Hungarian algorithm The procedure HUNGARIAN on page 737 and its subroutine FIND-AUGMENTING- PATH on page 738 follow the steps we have just seen. The third property in Lemma 25.15 ensures that in line 23 of F IND-AUGMENTING-PATH the queue Q is nonempty. The pseudocode uses the attribute � to indicate predecessor ver- tices in the breadth-ûrst forest. Instead of coloring vertices, as in the BFS proce- dure on page 556, the search puts the discovered vertices into the sets F L and F R . Because the Hungarian algorithm does not need breadth-ûrst distances, the pseu- docode omits the d attribute computed by the BFS procedure. 25.3 The Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem 735 R L r 1 r 2 r 4 r 5 r 7 G M,h (a) l 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 7 r 3 r 6 l 1 l 2 l 5 r 3 l 3 l 7 (h) r 6 l 1 r 7 r 4 l 4 r 2 l 7 (b) l 7 r 6 r 7 (c) l 3 l 7 r 6 l 1 r 7 (d) r 3 l 3 l 7 r 6 l 1 r 7 r 4 (e) l 2 l 5 r 3 l 3 l 7 r 6 l 1 r 7 r 4 (f) l 2 l 5 r 3 l 3 l 7 r 6 l 1 r 7 r 4 r 2 (g) Figure 25.9 (a) The new matching M and the new directed equality subgraph G M;h after up- dating the matching in Figure 25.8 with the M -augmenting path in Figure 25.8 parts (b) and (c).

After the vertex l 4 in part (h) has been removed from the queue, the queue becomes empty before the search discovers an unmatched vertex in R. Now, let’s see why the Hungarian algorithm runs in O.n 4 / time, where jV j D n=2 and jEj D n 2 in the original graph G. (Below we outline how to reduce the running time to O.n 3 /.) You can go through the pseudocode of H UNGARIAN to verify that lines 136 and 11 take O.n 2 / time. The while loop of lines 7310 iterates at most n times, since each iteration increases the size of the matching M by 1. Each test in line 7 can take constant time by just checking whether jM j < n, each update of M in line 9 takes O.n/ time, and the updates in line 10 take O.n 2 / time. To achieve the O.n 4 / time bound, it remains to show that each call of F IND- AUGMENTING-PATH runs in O.n 3 / time.

Ignoring the growth steps, you can verify that FIND-AUGMENTING- PATH is a breadth-ûrst search. With the sets F L and F R represented appropriately, the breadth-ûrst search takes O.V C E/ D O.n 2 / time. Within a call of FIND- AUGMENTING-PATH, at most n growth steps can occur, since each growth step is guaranteed to discover at least one vertex in R. Since there are at most n 2 edges in G M;h , the for loop of lines 16322 iterates at most n 2 times per call of FIND- AUGMENTING-PATH. The bottleneck is lines 10 and 15, which take O.n 2 / time, so that FIND-AUGMENTING-PATH takes O.n 3 / time. Exercise 25.3-5 asks you to show that reconstructing the directed equality sub- graph G M;h in line 15 is actually unnecessary, so that its cost can be eliminated. Re- ducing the cost of computing ı in line 10 to O.n/ takes a little more effort and is the subject of Problem 25-2.

Problem 20-3 asked about Euler tours in directed graphs. Prove that a con- nected, undirected graph G D .V; E/ has an Euler tour4a cycle traversing each edge exactly once, though it may visit a vertex multiple times4if and only if the degree of every vertex in V is even. b. Assuming that G is connected, undirected, and every vertex in V has even degree, give an O.E/-time algorithm to ûnd an Euler tour of G, as in Prob- lem 20-3(b). c. Exercise 25.1-6 states that if G D .V; E/ is a d -regular bipartite graph, then it contains d disjoint perfect matchings. Suppose that d is an exact power of 2. Give an algorithm to ûnd all d disjoint perfect matchings in a d -regular bipartite graph in ‚.E lg d / time. 25-2 Reducing the running time of the Hungarian algorithm to O.n 3 / In this problem, you will show how to reduce the running time of the Hungarian algorithm from O.n 4 / to O.n 3 / by showing how to reduce the running time of the FIND-AUGMENTING-PATH procedure from O.n 3 / to O.n 2 /. Exercise 25.3-5 demonstrates that line 6 of HUNGARIAN and line 15 of FIND-AUGMENTING- PATH are unnecessary. Now you will show how to reduce the running time of each execution of line 10 in FIND-AUGMENTING-PATH to O.n/. For each vertex r 2 R  F R , deûne a new attribute r:� , where r:� D min fl: h C r: h  w.l; r/ W l 2 F L g : That is, r:� indicates how close r is to being adjacent to some vertex l 2 F L in the directed equality subgraph G m;h .

Show how to update all the � attributes in O.n/ time after ı has been computed. c. Show that updating all the � attributes when F L changes takes O.n 2 / time per call of FIND-AUGMENTING-PATH. d. Conclude that the HUNGARIAN procedure can be implemented to run in O.n 3 / time. Problems for Chapter 25 741 25-3 Other matching problems The Hungarian algorithm ûnds a maximum-weight perfect matching in a complete bipartite graph. It is possible to use the Hungarian algorithm to solve problems in other graphs by modifying the input graph, running the Hungarian algorithm, and then possibly modifying the output. Show how to solve the following matching problems in this manner. a. Give an algorithm to ûnd a maximum-weight matching in a weighted bipartite graph that is not necessarily complete and with all edge weights positive. b. Redo part (a), but with edge weights allowed to also be 0 or negative. c. A cycle cover in a directed graph, not necessarily bipartite, is a set of edge- disjoint directed cycles such that each vertex lies on at most one cycle. Given nonnegative edge weights w.u; v/, let C be the set of edges in a cycle cover, and deûne w.C / D P .u;v/2C w.u; v/ to be the weight of the cycle cover. Give an algorithm to ûnd a maximum-weight cycle cover. 25-4 Fractional matchings It is possible to deûne a fractional matching. Given a graph G D .V; E/, we deûne a fractional matching x as a function x W E ! Œ0; 1� (real numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive) such that for every vertex u 2 V , we have P .u;v/2E x.u; v/ හ 1. The value of a fractional matching is P .u;v/2E x.u; v/. The deûnition of a fractional matching is identical to that of a matching, except that a matching has the additional constraint that x.u; v/ 2 f0; 1g for all edges .u; v/ 2 E. Given a graph, we let M  denote a maximum matching and x  denote a fractional matching with maximum value. a. Argue that, for any bipartite graph, we must have P .u;v/2E x  .u; v/  jM  j. b. Prove that, for any bipartite graph, we must have P .u;v/2E x  .e/ හ jM  j. (Hint: Give an algorithm that converts a fractional matching with an integer value to a matching.) Conclude that the maximum value of a fractional match- ing in a bipartite graph is the same as the size of the maximum cardinality matching. c. We can deûne a fractional matching in a weighted graph in the same manner: the value of the matching is now P .u;v/2E w.u; v/x.u; v/. Extend the results of the previous parts to show that in a weighted bipartite graph, the maximum value of a weighted fractional matching is equal to the value of a maximum weighted matching. 742 Chapter 25 Matchings in Bipartite Graphs d. In a general graph, the analogous results do not necessarily hold. Give an ex- ample of a small graph that is not bipartite for which the fractional matching with maximum value is not a maximum matching. 25-5 Computing vertex labels You are given a complete bipartite graph G D .V; E/ with edge weights w.l; r/ for all .l; r/ 2 E. You are also given a maximum-weight perfect matching M  for G. You wish to compute a feasible vertex labeling h such that M  is a perfect matching in the equality subgraph G h . That is, you want to compute a labeling h of vertices such that l: h C r: h  w.l; r/ for all l 2 L and r 2 R , (25.6) l: h C r: h D w.l; r/ for all .l; r/ 2 M  . (25.7) (Requirement (25.6) holds for all edges, and the stronger requirement (25.7) holds for all edges in M  .) Give an algorithm to compute the feasible vertex label- ing h, and prove that it is correct. (Hint: Use the similarity between conditions (25.6) and (25.7) and some of the properties of shortest paths proved in Chapter 22, in particular the triangle inequality (Lemma 22.10) and the convergence property (Lemma 22.14.)) Chapter notes Matching algorithms have a long history and have been central to many break- throughs in algorithm design and analysis. The book by Lov´ asz and Plummer [306] is an excellent reference on matching problems, and the chapter on matching in the book by Ahuja, Magnanti and Orlin [10] also has extensive references. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is by Hopcroft and Karp [224]. Madry [308] gave an e O.E 10=7 /-time algorithm, which is asymptotically faster than Hopcroft-Karp for sparse graphs. Corollary 25.4 is due to Berge [53], and it also holds in graphs that are not bi- partite. Matching in general graphs requires more complicated algorithms. The ûrst polynomial-time algorithm, running in O.V 4 / time, is due to Edmonds [130] (in a paper that also introduced the notion of a polynomial-time algorithm). Like the bipartite case, this algorithm also uses augmenting paths, although the algo- rithm for ûnding augmenting paths in general graphs is more involved than the one for bipartite graphs. Subsequently, several O. p V E/-time algorithms appeared, including ones by Gabow and Tarjan [168] as part of an algorithm for weighted matching and a simpler one by Gabow [164]. Notes for Chapter 25 743 The Hungarian algorithm is described in the book by Bondy and Murty [67] and is based on work by Kuhn [273] and Munkres [337]. Kuhn adopted the name <Hungarian algorithm= because the algorithm derived from work by the Hungarian mathematicians D. K˝ onig and J. Egerv´ ery. The algorithm is an early example of a primal-dual algorithm. A faster algorithm that runs in O. p V E log.V W // time, where the edge weights are integers from 0 to W , was given by Gabow and Tarjan [167], and an algorithm with the same time bound for maximum-weight matching in general graphs was given by Duan, Pettie, and Su [127]. The stable-marriage problem was ûrst deûned and analyzed by Gale and Shapley [169]. The stable-marriage problem has numerous variants. The books by Gusûeld and Irving [203], Knuth [266], and Manlove [313] serve as excellent sources for cataloging and solving them. Part VII Selected Topics Introduction This part contains a selection of algorithmic topics that extend and complement earlier material in this book. Some chapters introduce new models of computation such as circuits or parallel computers. Others cover specialized domains such as matrices or number theory. The last two chapters discuss some of the known lim- itations to the design of efûcient algorithms and introduce techniques for coping with those limitations. Chapter 26 presents an algorithmic model for parallel computing based on task- parallel computing, and more speciûcally, fork-join parallelism. The chapter in- troduces the basics of the model, showing how to quantify parallelism in terms of the measures of work and span. It then investigates several interesting fork-join algorithms, including algorithms for matrix multiplication and merge sorting. An algorithm that receives its input over time, rather than having the entire input available at the start, is called an <online= algorithm. Chapter 27 examines tech- niques used in online algorithms, starting with the <toy= problem of how long to wait for an elevator before taking the stairs. It then studies the <move-to-front= heuristic for maintaining a linked list and ûnishes with the online version of the caching problem we saw back in Section 15.4. The analyses of these online al- gorithms are remarkable in that they prove that these algorithms, which do not know their future inputs, perform within a constant factor of optimal algorithms that know the future inputs. Chapter 28 studies efûcient algorithms for operating on matrices. It presents two general methods4LU decomposition and LUP decomposition4for solving linear equations by Gaussian elimination in O.n 3 / time. It also shows that matrix inversion and matrix multiplication can be performed equally fast. The chapter concludes by showing how to compute a least-squares approximate solution when a set of linear equations has no exact solution. 746 Part VII Selected Topics Chapter 29 studies how to model problems as linear programs, where the goal is to maximize or minimize an objective, given limited resources and competing constraints. Linear programming arises in a variety of practical application areas. The chapter also addresses the concept of <duality= which, by establishing that a maximization problem and minimization problem have the same objective value, helps to show that solutions to each are optimal. Chapter 30 studies operations on polynomials and shows how to use a well- known signal-processing technique4the fast Fourier transform (FFT)4to multi- ply two degree-n polynomials in O.n lg n/ time. It also derives a parallel circuit to compute the FFT. Chapter 31 presents number-theoretic algorithms. After reviewing elementary number theory, it presents Euclid’s algorithm for computing greatest common di- visors. Next, it studies algorithms for solving modular linear equations and for raising one number to a power modulo another number. Then, it explores an impor- tant application of number-theoretic algorithms: the RSA public-key cryptosystem. This cryptosystem can be used not only to encrypt messages so that an adversary cannot read them, but also to provide digital signatures. The chapter ûnishes with the Miller-Rabin randomized primality test, which enables ûnding large primes efûciently4an essential requirement for the RSA system. Chapter 32 studies the problem of ûnding all occurrences of a given pattern string in a given text string, a problem that arises frequently in text-editing pro- grams. After examining the naive approach, the chapter presents an elegant ap- proach due to Rabin and Karp. Then, after showing an efûcient solution based on ûnite automata, the chapter presents the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which modiûes the automaton-based algorithm to save space by cleverly preprocessing the pattern. The chapter ûnishes by studying sufûx arrays, which can not only ûnd a pattern in a text string, but can do quite a bit more, such as ûnding the longest repeated substring in a text and ûnding the longest common substring appearing in two texts. Chapter 33 examines three algorithms within the expansive ûeld of machine learning. Machine-learning algorithms are designed to take in vast amounts of data, devise hypotheses about patterns in the data, and test these hypotheses. The chapter starts with k-means clustering, which groups data elements into k classes based on how similar they are to each other. It then shows how to use the technique of multiplicative weights to make predictions accurately based on a set of <experts= of varying quality. Perhaps surprisingly, even without knowing which experts are reliable and which are not, you can predict almost as accurately as the most reliable expert. The chapter ûnishes with gradient descent, an optimization technique that ûnds a local minimum value for a function. Gradient descent has many applica- tions, including ûnding parameter settings for many machine-learning models. Part VII Selected Topics 747 Chapter 34 concerns NP-complete problems. Many interesting computational problems are NP-complete, but no polynomial-time algorithm is known for solv- ing any of them. This chapter presents techniques for determining when a problem is NP-complete, using them to prove several classic problems NP-complete: de- termining whether a graph has a hamiltonian cycle (a cycle that includes every vertex), determining whether a boolean formula is satisûable (whether there exists an assignment of boolean values to its variables that causes the formula to eval- uate to TRUE), and determining whether a given set of numbers has a subset that adds up to a given target value. The chapter also proves that the famous traveling- salesperson problem (ûnd a shortest route that starts and ends at the same location and visits each of a set of locations once) is NP-complete. Chapter 35 shows how to ûnd approximate solutions to NP-complete problems efûciently by using approximation algorithms. For some NP-complete problems, approximate solutions that are near optimal are quite easy to produce, but for oth- ers even the best approximation algorithms known work progressively more poorly as the problem size increases. Then, there are some problems for which investing increasing amounts of computation time yields increasingly better approximate so- lutions. This chapter illustrates these possibilities with the vertex-cover problem (unweighted and weighted versions), an optimization version of 3-CNF satisûabil- ity, the traveling-salesperson problem, the set-covering problem, and the subset- sum problem. 26 Parallel Algorithms The vast majority of algorithms in this book are serial algorithms suitable for run- ning on a uniprocessor computer that executes only one instruction at a time. This chapter extends our algorithmic model to encompass parallel algorithms, where multiple instructions can execute simultaneously. Speciûcally, we’ll explore the elegant model of task-parallel algorithms, which are amenable to algorithmic de- sign and analysis. Our study focuses on fork-join parallel algorithms, the most basic and best understood kind of task-parallel algorithm. Fork-join parallel al- gorithms can be expressed cleanly using simple linguistic extensions to ordinary serial code. Moreover, they can be implemented efûciently in practice. Parallel computers4computers with multiple processing units4are ubiquitous. Handheld, laptop, desktop, and cloud machines are all multicore computers, or simply, multicores, containing multiple processing <cores.= Each processing core is a full-üedged processor that can directly access any location in a common shared memory. Multicores can be aggregated into larger systems, such as clusters, by using a network to interconnect them. These multicore clusters usually have a dis- tributed memory, where one multicore’s memory cannot be accessed directly by a processor in another multicore. Instead, the processor must explicitly send a mes- sage over the cluster network to a processor in the remote multicore to request any data it requires. The most powerful clusters are supercomputers, comprising many thousands of multicores. But since shared-memory programming tends to be con- ceptually easier than distributed-memory programming, and multicore machines are widely available, this chapter focuses on parallel algorithms for multicores. One approach to programming multicores is thread parallelism. This processor- centric parallel-programming model employs a software abstraction of <virtual processors,= or threads that share a common memory. Each thread maintains its own program counter and can execute code independently of the other threads. The operating system loads a thread onto a processing core for execution and switches it out when another thread needs to run. Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms 749 Unfortunately, programming a shared-memory parallel computer using threads tends to be difûcult and error-prone. One reason is that it can be complicated to dynamically partition the work among the threads so that each thread receives approximately the same load. For any but the simplest of applications, the pro- grammer must use complex communication protocols to implement a scheduler that load-balances the work. Task-parallel programming The difûculty of thread programming has led to the creation of task-parallel plat- forms, which provide a layer of software on top of threads to coordinate, schedule, and manage the processors of a multicore. Some task-parallel platforms are built as runtime libraries, but others provide full-üedged parallel languages with compiler and runtime support. Task-parallel programming allows parallelism to be speciûed in a <processor- oblivious= fashion, where the programmer identiûes what computational tasks may run in parallel but does not indicate which thread or processor performs the task. Thus, the programmer is freed from worrying about communication protocols, load balancing, and other vagaries of thread programming. The task-parallel platform contains a scheduler, which automatically load-balances the tasks across the pro- cessors, thereby greatly simplifying the programmer’s chore. Task-parallel algo- rithms provide a natural extension to ordinary serial algorithms, allowing perfor- mance to be reasoned about mathematically using <work/span analysis.= Fork-join parallelism Although the functionality of task-parallel environments is still evolving and in- creasing, almost all support fork-join parallelism, which is typically embodied in two linguistic features: spawning and parallel loops. Spawning allows a sub- routine to be <forked=: executed like a subroutine call, except that the caller can continue to execute while the spawned subroutine computes its result. A parallel loop is like an ordinary for loop, except that multiple iterations of the loop can execute at the same time. Fork-join parallel algorithms employ spawning and parallel loops to describe parallelism. A key aspect of this parallel model, inherited from the task-parallel model but different from the thread model, is that the programmer does not specify which tasks in a computation must run in parallel, only which tasks may run in parallel. The underlying runtime system uses threads to load-balance the tasks across the processors. This chapter investigates parallel algorithms described in the fork-join model, as well as how the underlying runtime system can schedule task-parallel computations (which include fork-join computations) efûciently. 750 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms Fork-join parallelism offers several important advantages:  The fork-join programming model is a simple extension of the familiar serial programming model used in most of this book. To describe a fork-join par- allel algorithm, the pseudocode in this book needs just three added keywords: parallel, spawn, and sync. Deleting these parallel keywords from the parallel pseudocode results in ordinary serial pseudocode for the same problem, which we call the <serial projection= of the parallel algorithm.  The underlying task-parallel model provides a theoretically clean way to quan- tify parallelism based on the notions of <work= and <span.=  Spawning allows many divide-and-conquer algorithms to be parallelized natu- rally. Moreover, just as serial divide-and-conquer algorithms lend themselves to analysis using recurrences, so do parallel algorithms in the fork-join model.  The fork-join programming model is faithful to how multicore programming has been evolving in practice. A growing number of multicore environments support one variant or another of fork-join parallel programming, including Cilk [290, 291, 383, 396], Habanero-Java [466], the Java Fork-Join Framework [279], OpenMP [81], Task Parallel Library [289], Threading Building Blocks [376], and X10 [82]. Section 26.1 introduces parallel pseudocode, shows how the execution of a task- parallel computation can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph, and presents the metrics of work, span, and parallelism, which you can use to analyze parallel al- gorithms. Section 26.2 investigates how to multiply matrices in parallel, and Sec- tion 26.3 tackles the tougher problem of designing an efûcient parallel merge sort. 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism Our exploration of parallel programming begins with the problem of computing Fibonacci numbers recursively in parallel. We’ll look at a straightforward serial Fibonacci calculation, which, although inefûcient, serves as a good illustration of how to express parallelism in pseudocode. Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are deûned by equation (3.31) on page 69: F i D Ĩ 0 if i D 0 ; 1 if i D 1 ; F i 1 C F i 2 if i  2 : To calculate the nth Fibonacci number recursively, you could use the ordinary serial algorithm in the procedure FIB on the facing page. You would not really want to 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 751 compute large Fibonacci numbers this way, because this computation does needless repeated work, but parallelizing it can be instructive. FIB.n/ 1 if n හ 1 2 return n 3 else x D FIB.n  1/ 4 y D FIB.n  2/ 5 return x C y To analyze this algorithm, let T .n/ denote the running time of FIB.n/. Since FIB.n/ contains two recursive calls plus a constant amount of extra work, we obtain the recurrence T .n/ D T .n  1/ C T .n  2/ C ‚.1/ : This recurrence has solution T .n/ D ‚.F n /, which we can establish by using the substitution method (see Section 4.3). To show that T .n/ D O.F n /, we’ll adopt the inductive hypothesis that T .n/ හ aF n  b, where a > 1 and b > 0 are constants. Substituting, we obtain T .n/ හ .aF n1  b/ C .aF n2  b/ C ‚.1/ D a.F n1 C F n2 /  2b C ‚.1/ හ aF n  b ; if we choose b large enough to dominate the upper-bound constant in the ‚.1/ term. We can then choose a large enough to upper-bound the ‚.1/ base case for small n. To show that T .n/ D �.F n /, we use the inductive hypothesis T .n/  aF n  b. Substituting and following reasoning similar to the asymptotic upper-bound argument, we establish this hypothesis by choosing b smaller than the lower-bound constant in the ‚.1/ term and a small enough to lower-bound the ‚.1/ base case for small n. Theorem 3.1 on page 56 then establishes that T .n/ D ‚.F n /, as desired. Since F n D ‚.� n /, where � D .1 C p 5/=2 is the golden ratio, by equation (3.34) on page 69, it follows that T .n/ D ‚.� n / : (26.1) Thus this procedure is a particularly slow way to compute Fibonacci numbers, since it runs in exponential time. (See Problem 31-3 on page 954 for faster ways.) Let’s see why the algorithm is inefûcient. Figure 26.1 shows the tree of recursive procedure instances created when computing F 6 with the FIB procedure. The call to FIB.6/ recursively calls FIB.5/ and then FIB.4/. But, the call to FIB.5/ also 752 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms FIB.0/ FIB.0/ FIB.0/ FIB.0/ FIB.0/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.1/ FIB.2/ FIB.2/ FIB.2/ FIB.2/ FIB.2/ FIB.3/ FIB.3/ FIB.3/ FIB.4/ FIB.4/ FIB.5/ FIB.6/ Figure 26.1 The invocation tree for F IB.6/. Each node in the tree represents a procedure instance whose children are the procedure instances it calls during its execution. Since each instance of F IB with the same argument does the same work to produce the same result, the inefûciency of this algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers can be seen by the vast number of repeated calls to compute the same thing. The portion of the tree shaded blue appears in task-parallel form in Figure 26.2. results in a call to FIB.4/. Both instances of FIB.4/ return the same result (F 4 D 3). Since the FIB procedure does not memoize (recall the deûnition of <memoize= from page 368), the second call to FIB.4/ replicates the work that the ûrst call performs, which is wasteful. Although the FIB procedure is a poor way to compute Fibonacci numbers, it can help us warm up to parallelism concepts. Perhaps the most basic concept is to understand is that if two parallel tasks operate on entirely different data, then4 absent other interference4they each produce the same outcomes when executed at the same time as when they run serially one after the other. Within FIB.n/, for example, the two recursive calls in line 3 to FIB.n  1/ and in line 4 to FIB.n  2/ can safely execute in parallel because the computation performed by one in no way affects the other. Parallel keywords The P-FIB procedure on the next page computes Fibonacci numbers, but using the parallel keywords spawn and sync to indicate parallelism in the pseudocode. If the keywords spawn and sync are deleted from P-FIB, the resulting pseu- docode text is identical to FIB (other than renaming the procedure in the header 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 753 P-FIB.n/ 1 if n හ 1 2 return n 3 else x D spawn P-FIB.n  1/ // don’t wait for subroutine to return 4 y D P-FIB.n  2/ // in parallel with spawned subroutine 5 sync // wait for spawned subroutine to ûnish 6 return x C y and in the two recursive calls). We deûne the serial projection 1 of a parallel al- gorithm to be the serial algorithm that results from ignoring the parallel directives, which in this case can be done by omitting the keywords spawn and sync. For parallel for loops, which we’ll see later on, we omit the keyword parallel. Indeed, our parallel pseudocode possesses the elegant property that its serial projection is always ordinary serial pseudocode to solve the same problem. Semantics of parallel keywords Spawning occurs when the keyword spawn precedes a procedure call, as in line 3 of P-FIB. The semantics of a spawn differs from an ordinary procedure call in that the procedure instance that executes the spawn4the parent4may continue to execute in parallel with the spawned subroutine4its child4instead of waiting for the child to ûnish, as would happen in a serial execution. In this case, while the spawned child is computing P-FIB.n  1/, the parent may go on to compute P-FIB.n2/ in line 4 in parallel with the spawned child. Since the P-FIB procedure is recursive, these two subroutine calls themselves create nested parallelism, as do their children, thereby creating a potentially vast tree of subcomputations, all executing in parallel. The keyword spawn does not say, however, that a procedure must execute in parallel with its spawned children, only that it may. The parallel keywords express the logical parallelism of the computation, indicating which parts of the compu- tation may proceed in parallel. At runtime, it is up to a scheduler to determine which subcomputations actually run in parallel by assigning them to available pro- 1 In mathematics, a projection is an idempotent function, that is, a function f such that f ı f D f . In this case, the function f maps the set P of fork-join programs to the set P S  P of serial programs, which are themselves fork-join programs with no parallelism. For a fork-join program x 2 P , since we have f .f .x// D f .x/, the serial projection, as we have deûned it, is indeed a mathematical projection. 754 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms cessors as the computation unfolds. We’ll discuss the theory behind task-parallel schedulers shortly (on page 759). A procedure cannot safely use the values returned by its spawned children un- til after it executes a sync statement, as in line 5. The keyword sync indicates that the procedure must wait as necessary for all its spawned children to ûnish be- fore proceeding to the statement after the sync4the <join= of a fork-join parallel computation. The P-FIB procedure requires a sync before the return statement in line 6 to avoid the anomaly that would occur if x and y were summed before P-FIB.n  1/ had ûnished and its return value had been assigned to x . In addition to explicit join synchronization provided by the sync statement, it is convenient to assume that every procedure executes a sync implicitly before it returns, thus ensuring that all children ûnish before their parent ûnishes. A graph model for parallel execution It helps to view the execution of a parallel computation4the dynamic stream of runtime instructions executed by processors under the direction of a parallel pro- gram4as a directed acyclic graph G D .V; E/, called a (parallel) trace. 2 Con- ceptually, the vertices in V are executed instructions, and the edges in E represent dependencies between instructions, where .u; v/ 2 E means that the parallel pro- gram required instruction u to execute before instruction v. It’s sometimes inconvenient, especially if we want to focus on the parallel struc- ture of a computation, for a vertex of a trace to represent only one executed instruc- tion. Consequently, if a chain of instructions contains no parallel or procedural control (no spawn, sync, procedure call, or return4via either an explicit return statement or the return that happens implicitly upon reaching the end of a proce- dure), we group the entire chain into a single strand. As an example, Figure 26.2 shows the trace that results from computing P-FIB.4/ in the portion of Figure 26.1 shaded blue. Strands do not include instructions that involve parallel or procedural control. These control dependencies must be represented as edges in the trace. When a parent procedure calls a child, the trace contains an edge .u; v/ from the strand u in the parent that executes the call to the ûrst strand v of the spawned child, as illustrated in Figure 26.2 by the edge from the orange strand in P-F IB.4/ to the blue strand in P-FIB.2/. When the last strand v 0 in the child returns, the trace contains an edge .v 0 ; u 0 / to the strand u 0 , where u 0 is the successor strand of u in the parent, as with the edge from the white strand in P-FIB.2/ to the white strand in P-FIB.4/. 2 Also called a computation dag in the literature. 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 755 P-FIB(1) P-FIB(0) P-FIB(3) P-FIB(4) P-FIB(1) P-FIB(1) P-FIB(0) P-FIB(2) P-FIB(2) Figure 26.2 The trace of P-FIB.4/ corresponding to the shaded portion of Figure 26.1. Each circle represents one strand, with blue circles representing any instructions executed in the part of the procedure (instance) up to the spawn of P-F IB.n  1/ in line 3; orange circles representing the instructions executed in the part of the procedure that calls P-FIB.n  2/ in line 4 up to the sync in line 5, where it suspends until the spawn of P-F IB.n  1/ returns; and white circles representing the instructions executed in the part of the procedure after the sync, where it sums x and y, up to the point where it returns the result. Strands belonging to the same procedure are grouped into a rounded rectangle, blue for spawned procedures and tan for called procedures. Assuming that each strand takes unit time, the work is 17 time units, since there are 17 strands, and the span is 8 time units, since the critical path4shown with blue edges4contains 8 strands. When the parent spawns a child, however, the trace is a little different. The edge .u; v/ goes from parent to child as with a call, such as the edge from the blue strand in P-FIB.4/ to the blue strand in P-FIB.3/, but the trace contains another edge .u; u 0 / as well, indicating that u’s successor strand u 0 can continue to execute while v is executing. The edge from the blue strand in P-FIB.4/ to the orange strand in P-FIB.4/ illustrates one such edge. As with a call, there is an edge from the last strand v 0 in the child, but with a spawn, it no longer goes to u’s successor. Instead, the edge is .v 0 ; x/, where x is the strand immediately following the sync in the parent that ensures that the child has ûnished, as with the edge from the white strand in P-FIB.3/ to the white strand in P-FIB.4/. You can ûgure out what parallel control created a particular trace. If a strand has two successors, one of them must have been spawned, and if a strand has multiple predecessors, the predecessors joined because of a sync statement. Thus, in the general case, the set V forms the set of strands, and the set E of directed edges represents dependencies between strands induced by parallel and procedural 756 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms control. If G contains a directed path from strand u to strand v, we say that the two strands are (logically) in series. If there is no path in G either from u to v or from v to u, the strands are (logically) in parallel. A fork-join parallel trace can be pictured as a dag of strands embedded in an invocation tree of procedure instances. For example, Figure 26.1 shows the invo- cation tree for FIB.6/, which also serves as the invocation tree for P-FIB.6/, the edges between procedure instances now representing either calls or spawns. Fig- ure 26.2 zooms in on the subtree that is shaded blue, showing the strands that con- stitute each procedure instance in P-FIB.4/. All directed edges connecting strands run either within a procedure or along undirected edges of the invocation tree in Figure 26.1. (More general task-parallel traces that are not fork-join traces may contain some directed edges that do not run along the undirected tree edges.) Our analyses generally assume that parallel algorithms execute on an ideal par- allel computer, which consists of a set of processors and a sequentially consistent shared memory. To understand sequential consistency, you ûrst need to know that memory is accessed by load instructions, which copy data from a location in the memory to a register within a processor, and by store instructions, which copy data from a processor register to a location in the memory. A single line of pseudocode can entail several such instructions. For example, the line x D y C ´ could result in load instructions to fetch each of y and ´ from memory into a processor, an in- struction to add them together inside the processor, and a store instruction to place the result x back into memory. In a parallel computer, several processors might need to load or store at the same time. Sequential consistency means that even if multiple processors attempt to access the memory simultaneously, the shared mem- ory behaves as if exactly one instruction from one of the processors is executed at a time, even though the actual transfer of data may happen at the same time. It is as if the instructions were executed one at a time sequentially according to some global linear order among all the processors that preserves the individual orders in which each processor executes its own instructions. For task-parallel computations, which are scheduled onto processors automati- cally by a runtime system, the sequentially consistent shared memory behaves as if a parallel computation’s executed instructions were executed one by one in the order of a topological sort (see Section 20.4) of its trace. That is, you can reason about the execution by imagining that the individual instructions (not generally the strands, which may aggregate many instructions) are interleaved in some linear order that preserves the partial order of the trace. Depending on scheduling, the linear order could vary from one run of the program to the next, but the behavior of any execution is always as if the instructions executed serially in a linear order consistent with the dependencies within the trace. In addition to making assumptions about semantics, the ideal parallel-computer model makes some performance assumptions. Speciûcally, it assumes that each 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 757 processor in the machine has equal computing power, and it ignores the cost of scheduling. Although this last assumption may sound optimistic, it turns out that for algorithms with sufûcient <parallelism= (a term we’ll deûne precisely a little later), the overhead of scheduling is generally minimal in practice. Performance measures We can gauge the theoretical efûciency of a task-parallel algorithm using work/ span analysis, which is based on two metrics: <work= and <span.= The work of a task-parallel computation is the total time to execute the entire computation on one processor. In other words, the work is the sum of the times taken by each of the strands. If each strand takes unit time, the work is just the number of vertices in the trace. The span is the fastest possible time to execute the computation on an unlimited number of processors, which corresponds to the sum of the times taken by the strands along a longest path in the trace, where <longest= means that each strand is weighted by its execution time. Such a longest path is called the critical path of the trace, and thus the span is the weight of the longest (weighted) path in the trace. (Section 22.2, pages 6173619 shows how to ûnd a critical path in a dag G D .V; E/ in ‚.V C E/ time.) For a trace in which each strand takes unit time, the span equals the number of strands on the critical path. For example, the trace of Figure 26.2 has 17 vertices in all and 8 vertices on its critical path, so that if each strand takes unit time, its work is 17 time units and its span is 8 time units. The actual running time of a task-parallel computation depends not only on its work and its span, but also on how many processors are available and how the scheduler allocates strands to processors. To denote the running time of a task- parallel computation on P processors, we subscript by P . For example, we might denote the running time of an algorithm on P processors by T P . The work is the running time on a single processor, or T 1 . The span is the running time if we could run each strand on its own processor4in other words, if we had an unlimited number of processors4and so we denote the span by T 1 . The work and span provide lower bounds on the running time T P of a task- parallel computation on P processors:  In one step, an ideal parallel computer with P processors can do at most P units of work, and thus in T P time, it can perform at most P T P work. Since the total work to do is T 1 , we have P T P  T 1 . Dividing by P yields the work law: T P  T 1 =P : (26.2)  A P -processor ideal parallel computer cannot run any faster than a machine with an unlimited number of processors. Looked at another way, a machine 758 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms with an unlimited number of processors can emulate a P -processor machine by using just P of its processors. Thus, the span law follows: T P  T 1 : (26.3) We deûne the speedup of a computation on P processors by the ratio T 1 =T P , which says how many times faster the computation runs on P processors than on one processor. By the work law, we have T P  T 1 =P , which implies that T 1 =T P හ P . Thus, the speedup on a P -processor ideal parallel computer can be at most P . When the speedup is linear in the number of processors, that is, when T 1 =T P D ‚.P /, the computation exhibits linear speedup. Perfect linear speedup occurs when T 1 =T P D P . The ratio T 1 =T 1 of the work to the span gives the parallelism of the parallel computation. We can view the parallelism from three perspectives. As a ratio, the parallelism denotes the average amount of work that can be performed in parallel for each step along the critical path. As an upper bound, the parallelism gives the maximum possible speedup that can be achieved on any number of processors. Per- haps most important, the parallelism provides a limit on the possibility of attaining perfect linear speedup. Speciûcally, once the number of processors exceeds the parallelism, the computation cannot possibly achieve perfect linear speedup. To see this last point, suppose that P > T 1 =T 1 , in which case the span law implies that the speedup satisûes T 1 =T P හ T 1 =T 1 < P . Moreover, if the number P of processors in the ideal parallel computer greatly exceeds the parallelism4that is, if P  T 1 =T 1 4then T 1 =T P  P , so that the speedup is much less than the number of processors. In other words, if the number of processors exceeds the parallelism, adding even more processors makes the speedup less perfect. As an example, consider the computation P-FIB.4/ in Figure 26.2, and assume that each strand takes unit time. Since the work is T 1 D 17 and the span is T 1 D 8, the parallelism is T 1 =T 1 D 17=8 D 2:125. Consequently, achieving much more than double the performance is impossible, no matter how many processors execute the computation. For larger input sizes, however, we’ll see that P-F IB.n/ exhibits substantial parallelism. We deûne the (parallel) slackness of a task-parallel computation executed on an ideal parallel computer with P processors to be the ratio .T 1 =T 1 /=P D T 1 =.P T 1 /, which is the factor by which the parallelism of the computation ex- ceeds the number of processors in the machine. Restating the bounds on speedup, if the slackness is less than 1, perfect linear speedup is impossible, because T 1 =.P T 1 / < 1 and the span law imply that T 1 =T P හ T 1 =T 1 < P . Indeed, as the slackness decreases from 1 and approaches 0, the speedup of the computa- tion diverges further and further from perfect linear speedup. If the slackness is less than 1, additional parallelism in an algorithm can have a great impact on its 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 759 execution efûciency. If the slackness is greater than 1, however, the work per pro- cessor is the limiting constraint. We’ll see that as the slackness increases from 1, a good scheduler can achieve closer and closer to perfect linear speedup. But once the slackness is much greater than 1, the advantage of additional parallelism shows diminishing returns. Scheduling Good performance depends on more than just minimizing the work and span. The strands must also be scheduled efûciently onto the processors of the parallel ma- chine. Our fork-join parallel-programming model provides no way for a program- mer to specify which strands to execute on which processors. Instead, we rely on the runtime system’s scheduler to map the dynamically unfolding computation to individual processors. In practice, the scheduler maps the strands to static threads, and the operating system schedules the threads on the processors themselves. But this extra level of indirection is unnecessary for our understanding of scheduling. We can just imagine that the scheduler maps strands to processors directly. A task-parallel scheduler must schedule the computation without knowing in ad- vance when procedures will be spawned or when they will ûnish4that is, it must operate online. Moreover, a good scheduler operates in a distributed fashion, where the threads implementing the scheduler cooperate to load-balance the computation. Provably good online, distributed schedulers exist, but analyzing them is compli- cated. Instead, to keep our analysis simple, we’ll consider an online centralized scheduler that knows the global state of the computation at any moment. In particular, we’ll analyze greedy schedulers, which assign as many strands to processors as possible in each time step, never leaving a processor idle if there is work that can be done. We’ll classify each step of a greedy scheduler as follows:  Complete step: At least P strands are ready to execute, meaning that all strands on which they depend have ûnished execution. A greedy scheduler assigns any P of the ready strands to the processors, completely utilizing all the pro- cessor resources.  Incomplete step: Fewer than P strands are ready to execute. A greedy sched- uler assigns each ready strand to its own processor, leaving some processors idle for the step, but executing all the ready strands. The work law tells us that the fastest running time T P that we can hope for on P processors must be at least T 1 =P . The span law tells us that the fastest possible running time must be at least T 1 . The following theorem shows that greedy scheduling is provably good in that it achieves the sum of these two lower bounds as an upper bound. 760 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms Theorem 26.1 On an ideal parallel computer with P processors, a greedy scheduler executes a task-parallel computation with work T 1 and span T 1 in time T P හ T 1 =P C T 1 : (26.4) Proof Without loss of generality, assume that each strand takes unit time. (If nec- essary, replace each longer strand by a chain of unit-time strands.) We’ll consider complete and incomplete steps separately. In each complete step, the P processors together perform a total of P work. Thus, if the number of complete steps is k, the total work executing all the complete steps is kP . Since the greedy scheduler doesn’t execute any strand more than once and only T 1 work needs to be performed, it follows that kP හ T 1 , from which we can conclude that the number k of complete steps is at most T 1 =P . Now, let’s consider an incomplete step. Let G be the trace for the entire com- putation, let G 0 be the subtrace of G that has yet to be executed at the start of the incomplete step, and let G 00 be the subtrace remaining to be executed after the in- complete step. Consider the set R of strands that are ready at the beginning of the incomplete step, where jRj < P . By deûnition, if a strand is ready, all its predeces- sors in trace G have executed. Thus the predecessors of strands in R do not belong to G 0 . A longest path in G 0 must necessarily start at a strand in R, since every other strand in G 0 has a predecessor and thus could not start a longest path. Because the greedy scheduler executes all ready strands during the incomplete step, the strands of G 00 are exactly those in G 0 minus the strands in R. Consequently, the length of a longest path in G 00 must be 1 less than the length of a longest path in G 0 . In other words, every incomplete step decreases the span of the trace remaining to be executed by 1. Hence, the number of incomplete steps can be at most T 1 . Since each step is either complete or incomplete, the theorem follows. The following corollary shows that a greedy scheduler always performs well. Corollary 26.2 The running time T P of any task-parallel computation scheduled by a greedy sched- uler on a P -processor ideal parallel computer is within a factor of 2 of optimal. Proof Let T  P be the running time produced by an optimal scheduler on a machine with P processors, and let T 1 and T 1 be the work and span of the computation, respectively. Since the work and span laws4inequalities (26.2) and (26.3)4give T  P  max fT 1 =P; T 1 g, Theorem 26.1 implies that T P හ T 1 =P C T 1 හ 2  max fT 1 =P; T 1 g හ 2T  P : 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 761 The next corollary shows that, in fact, a greedy scheduler achieves near-perfect linear speedup on any task-parallel computation as the slackness grows. Corollary 26.3 Let T P be the running time of a task-parallel computation produced by a greedy scheduler on an ideal parallel computer with P processors, and let T 1 and T 1 be the work and span of the computation, respectively. Then, if P  T 1 =T 1 , or equivalently, the parallel slackness is much greater than 1, we have T P  T 1 =P , a speedup of approximately P . Proof If we suppose that P  T 1 =T 1 , then it follows that T 1  T 1 =P , and hence Theorem 26.1 gives T P හ T 1 =P C T 1  T 1 =P . Since the work law (26.2) dictates that T P  T 1 =P , we conclude that T P  T 1 =P , which is a speedup of T 1 =T P  P . The  symbol denotes <much less,= but how much is <much less=? As a rule of thumb, a slackness of at least 104that is, 10 times more parallelism than pro- cessors4generally sufûces to achieve good speedup. Then, the span term in the greedy bound, inequality (26.4), is less than 10% of the work-per-processor term, which is good enough for most engineering situations. For example, if a computa- tion runs on only 10 or 100 processors, it doesn’t make sense to value parallelism of, say 1,000,000, over parallelism of 10,000, even with the factor of 100 differ- ence. As Problem 26-2 shows, sometimes reducing extreme parallelism yields algorithms that are better with respect to other concerns and which still scale up well on reasonable numbers of processors. Analyzing parallel algorithms We now have all the tools we need to analyze parallel algorithms using work/span analysis, allowing us to bound an algorithm’s running time on any number of pro- cessors. Analyzing the work is relatively straightforward, since it amounts to noth- ing more than analyzing the running time of an ordinary serial algorithm, namely, the serial projection of the parallel algorithm. You should already be familiar with analyzing work, since that is what most of this textbook is about! Analyzing the span is the new thing that parallelism engenders, but it’s generally no harder once you get the hang of it. Let’s investigate the basic ideas using the P-F IB program. Analyzing the work T 1 .n/ of P-FIB.n/ poses no hurdles, because we’ve already done it. The serial projection of P-FIB is effectively the original FIB procedure, and hence, we have T 1 .n/ D T .n/ D ‚.� n / from equation (26.1). Figure 26.3 illustrates how to analyze the span. If two traces are joined in series, their spans add to form the span of their composition, whereas if they are joined 762 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms A (a) (b) B A B Work: T 1 .A [ B/ D T 1 .A/ C T 1 .B/ Span: T 1 .A [ B/ D T 1 .A/ C T 1 .B/ Work: T 1 .A [ B/ D T 1 .A/ C T 1 .B/ Span: T 1 .A [ B/ D max.T 1 .A/; T 1 .B/) Figure 26.3 Series-parallel composition of parallel traces. (a) When two traces are joined in series, the work of the composition is the sum of their work, and the span of the composition is the sum of their spans. (b) When two traces are joined in parallel, the work of the composition remains the sum of their work, but the span of the composition is only the maximum of their spans. in parallel, the span of their composition is the maximum of the spans of the two traces. As it turns out, the trace of any fork-join parallel computation can be built up from single strands by series-parallel composition. Armed with an understanding of series-parallel composition, we can analyze the span of P-FIB.n/. The spawned call to P-FIB.n  1/ in line 3 runs in parallel with the call to P-FIB.n  2/ in line 4. Hence, we can express the span of P-F IB.n/ as the recurrence 1 .n/ D max fT 1 .n  1/; T 1 .n  2/g C ‚.1/ D T 1 .n  1/ C ‚.1/ ; which has solution T 1 .n/ D ‚.n/. (The second equality above follows from the ûrst because P-FIB.n  1/ uses P-FIB.n  2/ in its computation, so that the span of P-FIB.n  1/ must be at least as large as the span of P-F IB.n  2/.) The parallelism of P-FIB.n/ is T 1 .n/=T 1 .n/ D ‚.� n =n/, which grows dramat- ically as n gets large. Thus, Corollary 26.3 tells us that on even the lar gest parallel computers, a modest value for n sufûces to achieve near perfect linear speedup for P-FIB.n/, because this procedure exhibits considerable parallel slackness. Parallel loops Many algorithms contain loops for which all the iterations can operate in parallel. Although the spawn and sync keywords can be used to parallelize such loops, it is more convenient to specify directly that the iterations of such loops can run in parallel. Our pseudocode provides this functionality via the parallel keyword, which precedes the for keyword in a for loop statement. 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 763 As an example, consider the problem of multiplying a square n  n matrix A D .a ij / by an n-vector x D .x j /. The resulting n-vector y D .y i / is given by the equation i D n X j D1 a ij x j ; for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The P-MAT-VEC procedure performs matrix-vector multipli- cation (actually, y D y C Ax ) by computing all the entries of y in parallel. The parallel for keywords in line 1 of P-MAT-VEC indicate that the n iterations of the loop body, which includes a serial for loop, may be run in parallel. The initializa- tion y D 0, if desired, should be performed before calling the procedure (and can be done with a parallel for loop). P-MAT-VEC.A; x; y; n/ 1 parallel for i D 1 to n // parallel loop 2 for j D 1 to n // serial loop 3 y i D y i C a ij x j Compilers for fork-join parallel programs can implement parallel for loops in terms of spawn and sync by using recursive spawning. For example, for the parallel for loop in lines 133, a compiler can generate the auxiliary subroutine P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE and call P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE .A; x; y; n; 1; n/ in the place where the loop would be in the compiled code. As Figure 26.4 illus- trates, this procedure recursively spawns the ûrst half of the iterations of the loop to execute in parallel (line 5) with the second half of the iterations (line 6) and then executes a sync (line 7), thereby creating a binary tree of parallel execution. Each leaf represents a base case, which is the serial for loop of lines 233. P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE .A; x; y; n; i; i 0 / 1 if i == i 0 // just one iteration to do? 2 for j D 1 to n // mimic P-MAT-VEC serial loop 3 y i D y i C a ij x j 4 else mid D b.i C i 0 /=2c // parallel divide-and-conquer 5 spawn P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE .A; x; y; n; i; mid/ 6 P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE .A; x; y; n; mid C 1; i 0 / 7 sync To calculate the work T 1 .n/ of P-MAT-VEC on an n  n matrix, simply compute the running time of its serial projection, which comes from replacing the parallel 764 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms 1:1 2:2 3:3 4:4 5:5 6:6 7:7 8:8 1:2 3:4 5:6 7:8 1:4 5:8 1:8 Figure 26.4 A trace for the computation of P-M AT-VEC-RECURSIVE.A; x; y; 8; 1; 8/. The two numbers within each rounded rectangle give the values of the last two parameters (i and i 0 in the procedure header) in the invocation (spawn, in blue, or call, in tan) of the procedure. The blue circles represent strands corresponding to the part of the procedure up to the spawn of P-MAT-VEC-RECURSIVE in line 5. The orange circles represent strands corresponding to the part of the procedure that calls P-M AT-VEC-RECURSIVE in line 6 up to the sync in line 7, where it suspends until the spawned subroutine in line 5 returns. The white cir cles represent strands corresponding to the (negligible) part of the procedure after the sync up to the point where it returns. for loop in line 1 with an ordinary for loop. The running time of the resulting serial pseudocode is ‚.n 2 /, which means that T 1 .n/ D ‚.n 2 /. This analysis seems to ignore the overhead for recursive spawning in implementing the parallel loops, however. Indeed, the overhead of recursive spawning does increase the work of a parallel loop compared with that of its serial projection, but not asymptotically. To see why, observe that since the tree of recursive procedure instances is a full binary tree, the number of internal nodes is one less than the number of leaves (see Exercise B.5-3 on page 1175). Each internal node performs constant work to divide the iteration range, and each leaf corresponds to a base case, which takes at least constant time (‚.n/ time in this case). Thus, by amortizing the overhead of recursive spawning over the work of the iterations in the leaves, we see that the overall work increases by at most a constant factor. To reduce the overhead of recursive spawning, task-parallel platforms sometimes coarsen the leaves of the recursion by executing several iterations in a single leaf, either automatically or under programmer control. This optimization comes at the expense of reducing the parallelism. If the computation has sufûcient parallel slackness, however, near-perfect linear speedup won’t be sacriûced. 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 765 Although recursive spawning doesn’t affect the work of a parallel loop asymp- totically, we must take it into account when analyzing the span. Consider a parallel loop with n iterations in which the i th iteration has span iter 1 .i /. Since the depth of recursion is logarithmic in the number of iterations, the parallel loop’s span is T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg n/ C max fiter 1 .i / W 1 හ i හ ng : For example, let’s compute the span of the doubly nested loops in lines 133 of P-MAT-VEC. The span for the parallel for loop control is ‚.lg n/. For each it- eration of the outer parallel loop, the inner serial for loop contains n iterations of line 3. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total span for the inner serial for loop is ‚.n/, no matter which iteration of the outer parallel for loop it’s in. Thus, taking the maximum over all iterations of the outer loop and adding in the ‚.lg n/ for loop control yields an overall span of T 1 n D ‚.n/ C ‚.lg n/ D ‚.n/ for the procedure. Since the work is ‚.n 2 /, the parallelism is ‚.n 2 /=‚.n/ D ‚.n/. (Ex- ercise 26.1-7 asks you to provide an implementation with even more parallelism.) Race conditions A parallel algorithm is deterministic if it always does the same thing on the same input, no matter how the instructions are scheduled on the multicore computer. It is nondeterministic if its behavior might vary from run to run when the input is the same. A parallel algorithm that is intended to be deterministic may nevertheless act nondeterministically, however, if it contains a difûcult-to-diagnose bug called a <determinacy race.= Famous race bugs include the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine, which killed three people and injured several others, and the Northeast Blackout of 2003, which left over 50 million people in the United States without power. These pernicious bugs are notoriously hard to ûnd. You can run tests in the lab for days without a failure, only to discover that your software sporadically crashes in the ûeld, some- times with dire consequences. A determinacy race occurs when two logically parallel instructions access the same memory location and at least one of the instructions modiûes the value stored in the location. The toy procedure RACE-EXAMPLE on the following page illus- trates a determinacy race. After initializing x to 0 in line 1, RACE-EXAMPLE creates two parallel strands, each of which increments x in line 3. Although it might seem that a call of RACE-EXAMPLE should always print the value 2 (its se- rial projection certainly does), it could instead print the value 1. Let’s see how this anomaly might occur. When a processor increments x , the operation is not indivisible, but is composed of a sequence of instructions: 766 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms incr r 1 3 r 1 = x 2 x = r 1 7 incr r 2 5 r 2 = x 4 x = r 2 6 x = 0 1 print x 8 (a) step x r 1 r 2 1 2 4 5 6 7 0 1 – 1 1 1 1 – 1 1 (b) Figure 26.5 Illustration of the determinacy race in R ACE-EXAMPLE. (a) A trace showing the dependencies among individual instructions. The processor registers are r 1 and r 2 . Instructions unrelated to the race, such as the implementation of loop control, are omitted. (b) An execution sequence that elicits the bug, showing the values of x in memory and registers r 1 and r 2 for each step in the execution sequence. RACE-EXAMPLE . / 1 x D 0 2 parallel for i D 1 to 2 3 x D x C 1 // determinacy race 4 print x  Load x from memory into one of the processor’s registers.  Increment the value in the register.  Store the value in the register back into x in memory. Figure 26.5(a) illustrates a trace representing the execution of RACE-EXAMPLE, with the strands broken down to individual instructions. Recall that since an ideal parallel computer supports sequential consistency, you can view the parallel ex- ecution of a parallel algorithm as an interleaving of instructions that respects the dependencies in the trace. Part (b) of the ûgure shows the values in an execution of the computation that elicits the anomaly. The value x is kept in memory, and r 1 and r 2 are processor registers. In step 1, one of the processors sets x to 0. In steps 2 and 3, processor 1 loads x from memory into its register r 1 and increments it, producing the value 1 in r 1 . At that point, processor 2 comes into the picture, executing instructions 436. Processor 2 loads x from memory into register r 2 ; in- crements it, producing the value 1 in r 2 ; and then stores this value into x , setting x to 1. Now, processor 1 resumes with step 7, storing the value 1 in r 1 into x , which 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 767 leaves the value of x unchanged. Therefore, step 8 prints the value 1, rather than the value 2 that the serial projection would print. Let’s recap what happened. By sequential consistency, the effect of the parallel execution is as if the executed instructions of the two processors are interleaved. If processor 1 executes all its instructions before processor 2, a trivial interleaving, the value 2 is printed. Conversely, if processor 2 executes all its instructions before processor 1, the value 2 is still printed. When the instructions of the two processors interleave nontrivially, however, it is possible, as in this example execution, that one of the updates to x is lost, resulting in the value 1 being printed. Of course, many executions do not elicit the bug. That’s the problem with deter- minacy races. Generally, most instruction orderings produce correct results, such as any where the instructions on the left branch execute before the instructions on the right branch, or vice versa. But some orderings generate improper results when the instructions interleave. Consequently, races can be extremely hard to test for. Your program may fail, but you may be unable to reliably reproduce the fail- ure in subsequent tests, confounding your attempts to locate the bug in your code and ûx it. Task-parallel programming environments often provide race-detection productivity tools to help you isolate race bugs. Many parallel programs in the real world are intentionally nondeterministic. They contain determinacy races, but they mitigate the dangers of nondeterminism through the use of mutual-exclusion locks and other methods of synchronization. For our purposes, however, we’ll insist on an absence of determinacy races in the algorithms we develop. Nondeterministic programs are indeed interesting, but non- deterministic programming is a more advanced topic and unnecessary for a wide swath of interesting parallel algorithms. To ensure that algorithms are deterministic, any two strands that operate in par- allel should be mutually noninterfering: they only read, and do not modify, any memory locations accessed by both of them. Consequently, in a parallel for con- struct, such as the outer loop of P-MAT-VEC, we want all the iterations of the body, including any code an iteration executes in subroutines, to be mutually non- interfering. And between a spawn and its corresponding sync, we want the code executed by the spawned child and the code executed by the parent to be mutually noninterfering, once again including invoked subroutines. As an example of how easy it is to write code with unintentional races, the P-MAT-VEC-WRONG procedure on the next page is a faulty parallel implementa- tion of matrix-vector multiplication that achieves a span of ‚.lg n/ by parallelizing the inner for loop. This procedure is incorrect, unfortunately, due to determinacy races when updating y i in line 3, which executes in parallel for all n values of j . Index variables of parallel for loops, such as i in line 1 and j in line 2, do not cause races between iterations. Conceptually, each iteration of the loop creates an independent variable to hold the index of that iteration during that iteration’s 768 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms P-MAT-VEC-WRONG .A; x; y; n/ 1 parallel for i D 1 to n 2 parallel for j D 1 to n 3 y i D y i C a ij x j // determinacy race execution of the loop body. Even if two parallel iterations both access the same in- dex variable, they really are accessing different variable instances4hence different memory locations4and no race occurs. A parallel algorithm with races can sometimes be deterministic. As an exam- ple, two parallel threads might store the same value into a shared variable, and it wouldn’t matter which stored the value ûrst. For simplicity , however, we generally prefer code without determinacy races, even if the races are benign. And good parallel programmers frown on code with determinacy races that cause nondeter- ministic behavior, if deterministic code that performs comparably is an option. But nondeterministic code does have its place. For example, you can’t im- plement a parallel hash table, a highly practical data structure, without writing code containing determinacy races. Much research has centered around how to ex- tend the fork-join model to incorporate limited <structured= nondeterminism while avoiding the full measure of complications that arise when nondeterminism is com- pletely unrestricted. chess lesson To illustrate the power of work/span analysis, this section closes with a true story that occurred during the development of one of the ûrst world-class parallel chess- playing programs [106] many years ago. The timings below have been simpliûed for exposition. The chess program was developed and tested on a 32-processor computer, but it was designed to run on a supercomputer with 512 processors. Since the supercom- puter availability was limited and expensive, the developers ran benchmarks on the small computer and extrapolated performance to the large computer. At one point, the developers incorporated an optimization into the program that reduced its running time on an important benchmark on the small machine from T 32 D 65 seconds to T 0 32 D 40 seconds. Yet, the developers used the work and span performance measures to conclude that the optimized version, which was faster on 32 processors, would actually be slower than the original version on the 512 processors of the large machine. As a result, they abandoned the <optimization.= Here is their work/span analysis. The original version of the program had work T 1 D 2048 seconds and span T 1 D 1 second. Let’s treat inequality (26.4) on 26.1 The basics of fork-join parallelism 769 page 760 as the equation T P D T 1 =P C T 1 , which we can use as an approximation to the running time on P processors. Then indeed we have T 32 D 2048=32 C 1 D 65. With the optimization, the work becomes T 0 1 D 1024 seconds, and the span becomes T 0 1 D 8 seconds. Our approximation gives T 0 32 D 1024=32 C 8 D 40. The relative speeds of the two versions switch when we estimate their running times on 512 processors, however. The ûrst version has a running time of T 512 D 2048=512C1 D 5 seconds, and the second version runs in T 0 512 D 1024=512C8 D 10 seconds. The optimization that speeds up the program on 32 processors makes the program run for twice as long on 512 processors! The optimized version’s span of 8, which is not the dominant term in the running time on 32 processors, becomes the dominant term on 512 processors, nullifying the advantage from using more processors. The optimization does not scale up. The moral of the story is that work/span analysis, and measurements of work and span, can be superior to measured running times alone in extrapolating an algorithm’s scalability. Exercises 26.1-1 What does a trace for the execution of a serial algorithm look like? 26.1-2 Suppose that line 4 of P-FIB spawns P-FIB.n  2/, rather than calling it as is done in the pseudocode. How would the trace of P-FIB(4) in Figure 26.2 change? What is the impact on the asymptotic work, span, and parallelism? 26.1-3 Draw the trace that results from executing P-FIB.5/. Assuming that each strand in the computation takes unit time, what are the work, span, and parallelism of the computation? Show how to schedule the trace on 3 processors using greedy scheduling by labeling each strand with the time step in which it is executed. 26.1-4 Prove that a greedy scheduler achieves the following time bound, which is slightly stronger than the bound proved in Theorem 26.1: T P හ T 1  T 1 P C T 1 : (26.5) 26.1-5 Construct a trace for which one execution by a greedy scheduler can take nearly twice the time of another execution by a greedy scheduler on the same number of processors. Describe how the two executions would proceed. 770 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms 26.1-6 Professor Karan measures her deterministic task-parallel algorithm on 4, 10, and 64 processors of an ideal parallel computer using a greedy scheduler. She claims that the three runs yielded T 4 D 80 seconds, T 10 D 42 seconds, and T 64 D 10 seconds. Argue that the professor is either lying or incompetent. (Hint: Use the work law (26.2), the span law (26.3), and inequality (26.5) from Exercise 26.1-4.) 26.1-7 Give a parallel algorithm to multiply an n  n matrix by an n-vector that achieves ‚.n 2 = lg n/ parallelism while maintaining ‚.n 2 / work. 26.1-8 Analyze the work, span, and parallelism of the procedure P-T RANSPOSE, which transposes an n  n matrix A in place.

We’ll see that each algorithm can be paral- lelized in a straightforward fashion using either parallel loops or recursive spawn- ing. We’ll analyze them using work/span analysis, and we’ll see that each parallel algorithm attains the same performance on one processor as its corresponding se- rial algorithm, while scaling up to large numbers of processors. 26.2 Parallel matrix multiplication 771 A parallel algorithm for matrix multiplication using parallel loops The ûrst algorithm we’ll study is P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY, which simply paral- lelizes the two outer loops in the procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 81. P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY .A; B; C; n/ 1 parallel for i D 1 to n // compute entries in each of n rows 2 parallel for j D 1 to n // compute n entries in row i 3 for k D 1 to n 4 c ij D c ij C a i k  b kj // add in another term of equation (4.1) Let’s analyze P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY. Since the serial projection of the algo- rithm is just MATRIX-MULTIPLY, the work is the same as the running time of MATRIX-MULTIPLY: T 1 .n/ D ‚.n 3 /. The span is T 1 .n/ D ‚.n/, because it fol- lows a path down the tree of recursion for the parallel for loop starting in line 1, then down the tree of recursion for the parallel for loop starting in line 2, and then executes all n iterations of the ordinary for loop starting in line 3, resulting in a total span of ‚.lg n/ C ‚.lg n/ C ‚.n/ D ‚.n/. Thus the parallelism is ‚.n 3 /=‚.n/ D ‚.n 2 /. (Exercise 26.2-3 asks you to parallelize the inner loop to obtain a parallelism of ‚.n 3 = lg n/, which you cannot do straightforwardly using parallel for, because you would create races.) A parallel divide-and-conquer algorithm for matrix multiplication Section 4.1 shows how to multiply n  n matrices serially in ‚.n 3 / time using a divide-and-conquer strategy. Let’s see how to parallelize that algorithm using recursive spawning instead of calls. The serial MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure on page 83 takes as input three n  n matrices A, B , and C and performs the matrix calculation C D C C A  B by recursively performing eight multiplications of n=2  n=2 submatrices of A and B . The P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure on the following page implements the same divide-and-conquer strategy, but it uses spawning to perform the eight multiplications in parallel. To avoid determinacy races in updating the elements of C , it creates a temporary matrix D to store four of the submatrix products. At the end, it adds C and D together to produce the ûnal result. (Problem 26-2 asks you to eliminate the temporary matrix D at the expense of some parallelism.) Lines 233 of P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE handle the base case of mul- tiplying 1  1 matrices. The remainder of the procedure deals with the recursive case. Line 4 allocates a temporary matrix D, and lines 537 zero it. Line 8 parti- tions each of the four matrices A, B , C , and D into n=2  n=2 submatrices. (As 772 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A; B; C; n/ 1 if n == 1 // just one element in each matrix? 2 c 11 D c 11 C a 11  b 11 3 return 4 let D be a new n  n matrix // temporary matrix 5 parallel for i D 1 to n // set D D 0 6 parallel for j D 1 to n 7 d ij D 0 8 partition A, B , C , and D into n=2  n=2 submatrices A 11 ; A 12 ; A 21 ; A 22 ; B 11 ; B 12 ; B 21 ; B 22 ; C 11 ; C 12 ; C 21 ; C 22 ; and D 11 ; D 12 ; D 21 ; D 22 ; respectively 9 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 11 ; B 11 ; C 11 ; n=2/ 10 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 11 ; B 12 ; C 12 ; n=2/ 11 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 21 ; B 11 ; C 21 ; n=2/ 12 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 21 ; B 12 ; C 22 ; n=2/ 13 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 12 ; B 21 ; D 11 ; n=2/ 14 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 12 ; B 22 ; D 12 ; n=2/ 15 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 22 ; B 21 ; D 21 ; n=2/ 16 spawn P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE .A 22 ; B 22 ; D 22 ; n=2/ 17 sync // wait for spawned submatrix products 18 parallel for i D 1 to n // update C D C C D 19 parallel for j D 1 to n 20 c ij D c ij C d ij with MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE on page 83, we’re glossing over the subtle issue of how to use index calculations to represent submatrix sections of a matrix.) The spawned recursive call in line 9 sets C 11 D C 11 C A 11  B 11 , so that C 11 ac- cumulates the ûrst of the two terms in equation (4.5) on page 82. Similarly, lines 10312 cause each of C 12 , C 21 , and C 22 in parallel to accumulate the ûrst of the two terms in equations (4.6)3(4.8), respectively. Line 13 sets the submatrix D 11 to the submatrix product A 12  B 21 , so that D 11 equals the second of the two terms in equation (4.5). Lines 14316 set each of D 12 , D 21 , and D 22 in parallel to the second of the two terms in equations (4.6)3(4.8), respectively. The sync statement in line 17 ensures that all the spawned submatrix products in lines 9316 have been computed, after which the doubly nested parallel for loops in lines 18320 add the elements of D to the corresponding elements of C . Let’s analyze the P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure. We start by analyzing the work M 1 .n/, echoing the serial running-time analysis of its progen- itor MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE. The recursive case allocates and zeros the 26.2 Parallel matrix multiplication 773 temporary matrix D in ‚.n 2 / time, partitions in ‚.1/ time, performs eight recur- sive multiplications of n=2  n=2 matrices, and ûnishes up with the ‚.n 2 / work from adding two n  n matrices. Thus the work outside the spawned recursive calls is ‚.n 2 /, and the recurrence for the work M 1 .n/ becomes M 1 .n/ D 8M 1 .n=2/ C ‚.n 2 / D ‚.n 3 / by case 1 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1). Not surprisingly, the work of this parallel algorithm is asymptotically the same as the running time of the procedure MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 81, with its triply nested loops. Let’s determine the span M 1 .n/ of P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE. Be- cause the eight parallel recursive spawns all execute on matrices of the same size, the maximum span for any recursive spawn is just the span of a single one of them, or M 1 .n=2/. The span for the doubly nested parallel for loops in lines 537 is ‚.lg n/ because each loop control adds ‚.lg n/ to the constant span of line 7. Similarly, the doubly nested parallel for loops in lines 18320 add another ‚.lg n/. Matrix partitioning by index calculation has ‚.1/ span, which is dominated by the ‚.lg n/ span of the nested loops. We obtain the recurrence M 1 .n/ D M 1 .n=2/ C ‚.lg n/ : (26.6) Since this recurrence falls under case 2 of the master theorem with k D 1, the solution is M 1 .n/ D ‚.lg 2 n/. The parallelism of P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE is M 1 .n/=M 1 .n/ D ‚.n 3 = lg 2 n/, which is huge. (Problem 26-2 asks you to simplify this parallel al- gorithm at the expense of just a little less parallelism.) Parallelizing Strassen’s method To parallelize Strassen’s algorithm, we can follow the same general outline as on pages 86387, but use spawning. You may ûnd it helpful to compare each step below with the corresponding step there. We’ll analyze costs as we go along to develop recurrences T 1 .n/ and T 1 .n/ for the overall work and span, respectively. 1. If n D 1, the matrices each contain a single element. Perform a single scalar multiplication and a single scalar addition, and return. Otherwise, partition the input matrices A and B and output matrix C into n=2  n=2 submatrices, as in equation (4.2) on page 82. This step takes ‚.1/ work and ‚.1/ span by index calculation. 2. Create n=2  n=2 matrices S 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S 10 , each of which is the sum or dif- ference of two submatrices from step 1. Create and zero the entries of seven n=2n=2 matrices P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P 7 to hold seven n=2n=2 matrix products. All 774 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms 17 matrices can be created, and the P i initialized, with doubly nested parallel for loops using ‚.n 2 / work and ‚.lg n/ span. 3. Using the submatrices from step 1 and the matrices S 1 ; S 2 ; : : : ; S 10 created in step 2, recursively spawn computations of each of the seven n=2  n=2 matrix products P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P 7 , taking 7T 1 .n=2/ work and T 1 .n=2/ span. 4. Update the four submatrices C 11 ; C 12 ; C 21 ; C 22 of the result matrix C by adding or subtracting various P i matrices. Using doubly nested parallel for loops, computing all four submatrices takes ‚.n 2 / work and ‚.lg n/ span. Let’s analyze this algorithm. Since the serial projection is the same as the orig- inal serial algorithm, the work is just the running time of the serial projection, namely, ‚.n lg 7 /. As we did with P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, we can devise a recurrence for the span. In this case, seven recursive calls execute in parallel, but since they all operate on matrices of the same size, we obtain the same recurrence (26.6) as we did for P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, with solution ‚.lg 2 n/. Thus the parallel version of Strassen’s method has parallelism ‚.n lg 7 = lg 2 n/, which is large. Although the parallelism is slightly less than that of P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE, that’s just because the work is also less. Exercises 26.2-1 Draw the trace for computing P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY on 2  2 matrices, labeling how the vertices in your diagram correspond to strands in the execution of the algorithm. Assuming that each strand executes in unit time, analyze the work, span, and parallelism of this computation. 26.2-2 Repeat Exercise 26.2-1 for P-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE. 26.2-3 Give pseudocode for a parallel algorithm that multiplies two n  n matrices with work ‚.n 3 / but span only ‚.lg n/. Analyze your algorithm. 26.2-4 Give pseudocode for an efûcient parallel algorithm that multiplies a p  q matrix by a q  r matrix. Your algorithm should be highly parallel even if any of p, q, and r equal 1. Analyze your algorithm. 26.3 Parallel merge sort 775 26.2-5 Give pseudocode for an efûcient parallel version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm (see Section 23.2), which computes shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted graph. Analyze your algorithm. 26.3 Parallel merge sort We ûrst saw serial merge sort in Section 2.3.1, and in Section 2.3.2 we analyzed its running time and showed it to be ‚.n lg n/. Because merge sort already uses the divide-and-conquer method, it seems like a terriûc candidate for implementing using fork-join parallelism. The procedure P-MERGE-SORT modiûes merge sort to spawn the ûrst recursive call. Like its serial counterpart MERGE-SORT on page 39, the P-MERGE-SORT procedure sorts the subarray AŒp W r�. After the sync statement in line 8 ensures that the two recursive spawns in lines 5 and 7 have ûnished, P- MERGE-SORT calls the P-MERGE procedure, a parallel merging algorithm, which is on page 779, but you don’t need to bother looking at it right now. P-MERGE-SORT .A; p; r/ 1 if p  r // zero or one element? 2 return 3 q D b.p C r/=2c // midpoint of AŒp W r� 4 // Recursively sort AŒp W q� in parallel. 5 spawn P-MERGE-SORT .A; p; q/ 6 // Recursively sort AŒq C 1 W r� in parallel. 7 spawn P-MERGE-SORT .A; q C 1; r/ 8 sync // wait for spawns 9 // Merge AŒp W q� and AŒq C 1 W r� into AŒp W r�. 10 P-MERGE.A; p; q; r/ First, let’s use work/span analysis to get some intuition for why we need a par- allel merge procedure. After all, it may seem as though there should be plenty of parallelism just by parallelizing MERGE-SORT without worrying about paral- lelizing the merge. But what would happen if the call to P-MERGE in line 10 of P-MERGE-SORT were replaced by a call to the serial MERGE procedure on page 36? Let’s call the pseudocode so modiûed P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT. Let T 1 .n/ be the (worst-case) work of P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT on an n-element subarray, where n D r  p C 1 is the number of elements in AŒp W r�, and let T 1 .n/ 776 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms be the span. Because MERGE is serial with running time ‚.n/, both its work and span are ‚.n/. Since the serial projection of P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT is exactly MERGE-SORT, its work is T 1 .n/ D ‚.n lg n/. The two recursive calls in lines 5 and 7 run in parallel, and so its span is given by the recurrence T 1 .n/ D T 1 .n=2/ C ‚.n/ D ‚.n/ ; by case 1 of the master theorem. Thus the parallelism of P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT is T 1 .n/=T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg n/, which is an unimpressive amount of parallelism. To sort a million elements, for example, since lg 10 6  20, it might achieve linear speedup on a few processors, but it would not scale up to dozens of processors. The parallelism bottleneck in P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT is plainly the MERGE procedure. If we asymptotically reduce the span of merging, the master theorem dictates that the span of parallel merge sort will also get smaller. When you look at the pseudocode for MERGE, it may seem that merging is inherently serial, but it’s not. We can fashion a parallel merging algorithm. The goal is to reduce the span of parallel merging asymptotically, but if we want an efûcient parallel algorithm, we must ensure that the ‚.n/ bound on work doesn’t increase. Figure 26.6 depicts the divide-and-conquer strategy that we’ll use in P-M ERGE. The heart of the algorithm is a recursive auxiliary procedure P-MERGE-AUX that merges two sorted subarrays of an array A into a subarray of another array B in parallel. Speciûcally, P-MERGE-AUX merges AŒp 1 W r 1 � and AŒp 2 W r 2 � into subarray BŒp 3 W r 3 �, where r 3 D p 3 C .r 1  p 1 C 1/ C .r 2  p 2 C 1/  1 D p 3 C .r 1  p 1 / C .r 2  p 2 / C 1. The key idea of the recursive merging algorithm in P-MERGE-AUX is to split each of the two sorted subarrays of A around a pivot x , such that all the elements in the lower part of each subarray are at most x and all the elements in the upper part of each subarray are at least x . The procedure can then recurse in parallel on two subtasks: merging the two lower parts, and merging the two upper parts. The trick is to ûnd a pivot x so that the recursion is not too lopsided. We don’t want a situation such as that in QUICKSORT on page 183, where bad partitioning elements lead to a dramatic loss of asymptotic efûciency. We could opt to partition around a random element, as RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT on page 192 does, but because the input subarrays are sorted, P-MERGE-AUX can quickly determine a pivot that always works well. Speciûcally, the recursive merging algorithm picks the pivot x as the middle element of the larger of the two input subarrays, which we can assume without loss of generality is AŒp 1 W r 1 �, since otherwise, the two subarrays can just switch roles. That is, x D AŒq 1 �, where q 1 D b.p 1 C r 1 /=2c. Because AŒp 1 W r 1 � is sorted, x is a median of the subarray elements: every element in AŒp 1 W q 1  1� is no more than x , and every element in AŒq 1 C 1 W r 1 � is no less than x .

To merge, compute the index q 3 where x belongs in BŒp 3 W r 3 �, copy x into BŒq 3 �, and then recursively merge AŒp 1 W q 1  1� with AŒp 2 W q 2  1� into BŒp 3 W q 3  1� and AŒq 1 C 1 W r 1 � with AŒq 2 W r 2 � into BŒq 3 C 1 W r 3 �. algorithm ûnds the <split point= q 2 in the smaller subarray AŒp 2 W r 2 � such that all the elements in AŒp 2 W q 2  1� (if any) are at most x and all the elements in AŒq 2 W r 2 � (if any) are at least x . Intuitively, the subarray AŒp 2 W r 2 � would still be sorted if x were inserted between AŒq 2 1� and AŒq 2 � (although the algorithm doesn’t do that). Since AŒp 2 W r 2 � is sorted, a minor variant of binary search (see Exercise 2.3-6) with x as the search key can ûnd the split point q 2 in ‚.lg n/ time in the worst case. As we’ll see when we get to the analysis, even if x splits AŒp 2 W r 2 � badly4x is either smaller than all the subarray elements or larger4we’ll still have at least 1=4 of the elements in each of the two recursive merges. Thus the larger of the recursive merges operates on at most 3=4 elements, and the recursion is guaranteed to bottom out after ‚.lg n/ recursive calls. Now let’s put these ideas into pseudocode. We start with the serial procedure FIND-SPLIT-POINT .A; p; r; x/ on the next page, which takes as input a sorted subarray AŒp W r� and a key x . The procedure returns a split point of AŒp W r�: an index q in the range p හ q හ r C 1 such that all the elements in AŒp W q  1� (if any) are at most x and all the elements in AŒq W r� (if any) are at least x . The FIND-SPLIT-POINT procedure uses binary search to ûnd the split point. Lines 1 and 2 establish the range of indices for the search. Each time through the while loop, line 5 compares the middle element of the range with the search key x , and lines 6 and 7 narrow the search range to either the lower half or the upper half of the subarray, depending on the result of the test. In the end, after the range has been narrowed to a single index, line 8 returns that index as the split point. 778 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms FIND-SPLIT-POINT .A; p; r; x/ 1 low D p // low end of search range 2 high D r C 1 // high end of search range 3 while low < high // more than one element? 4 mid D b.low C high/=2c // midpoint of range 5 if x හ AŒmid� // is answer q හ mid? 6 high D mid // narrow search to AŒlow W mid� 7 else low D mid C 1 // narrow search to AŒmid C 1 W high� 8 return low Because FIND-SPLIT-POINT contains no parallelism, its span is just its serial running time, which is also its work. On a subarray AŒp W r� of size n D r  p C 1, each iteration of the while loop halves the search range, which means that the loop terminates after ‚.lg n/ iterations. Since each iteration takes constant time, the algorithm runs in ‚.lg n/ (worst-case) time. Thus the procedure has work and span ‚.lg n/. Let’s now look at the pseudocode for the parallel merging procedure P-M ERGE on the next page. Most of the pseudocode is devoted to the recursive procedure P-MERGE-AUX. The procedure P-MERGE itself is just a <wrapper= that sets up for P-MERGE-AUX. It allocates a new array BŒp W r� to hold the output of P-MERGE-AUX in line 1. It then calls P-MERGE-AUX in line 2, passing the in- dices of the two subarrays to be merged and providing B as the output destination of the merged result, starting at index p. After P-MERGE-AUX returns, lines 334 perform a parallel copy of the output BŒp W r� into the subarray AŒp W r�, which is where P-MERGE-SORT expects it. The P-MERGE-AUX procedure is the interesting part of the algorithm. Let’s start by understanding the parameters of this recursive parallel procedure. The input array A and the four indices p 1 ; r 1 ; p 2 ; r 2 specify the subarrays AŒp 1 W r 1 � and AŒp 2 W r 2 � to be merged. The array B and the index p 3 indicate that the merged result should be stored into BŒp 3 W r 3 �, where r 3 D p 3 C .r 1  p 1 / C .r 2  p 2 / C 1, as we saw earlier. The end index r 3 of the output subarray is not needed by the pseudocode, but it helps conceptually to name the end index, as in the comment in line 13. The procedure begins by checking the base case of the recursion and doing some bookkeeping to simplify the rest of the pseudocode. Lines 1 and 2 test whether the two subarrays are both empty, in which case the procedure returns. Line 3 checks whether the ûrst subarray contains fewer elements than the second subarray. Since the number of elements in the ûrst subarray is r 1  p 1 C 1 and the number in the second subarray is r 2  p 2 C 1, the test omits the two <C1’s.= If the ûrst subarray 26.3 Parallel merge sort 779 P-MERGE.A; p; q; r/ 1 let BŒp W r� be a new array // allocate scratch array 2 P-MERGE-AUX .A; p; q; q C 1; r; B; p/ // merge from A into B 3 parallel for i D p to r // copy B back to A in parallel 4 AŒi � D BŒi � P-MERGE-AUX.A; p 1 ; r 1 ; p 2 ; r 2 ; B; p 3 / 1 if p 1 > r and p 2 > r 2 // are both subarrays empty? 2 return 3 if r 1  p 1 < r  p 2 // second subarray bigger? 4 exchange p 1 with p 2 // swap subarray roles 5 exchange r 1 with r 2 6 q 1 D b.p 1 C r 1 /=2c // midpoint of AŒp 1 W r 1 � 7 x D AŒq 1 � // median of AŒp 1 W r 1 � is pivot x 8 q 2 D FIND-SPLIT-POINT .A; p 2 ; r 2 ; x/ // split AŒp 2 W r 2 � around x 9 q 3 D p 3 C .q 1  p 1 / C .q 2  p 2 / // where x belongs in B : : : 10 BŒq 3 � D x // : : : put it there 11 // Recursively merge AŒp 1 W q 1  1� and AŒp 2 W q 2  1� into BŒp 3 W q 3  1�. 12 spawn P-MERGE-AUX.A; p 1 ; q 1  1; p 2 ; q 2  1; B; p 3 / 13 // Recursively merge AŒq 1 C 1 W r 1 � and AŒq 2 W r 2 � into BŒq 3 C 1 W r 3 �. 14 spawn P-MERGE-AUX.A; q 1 C 1; r 1 ; q 2 ; r 2 ; B; q 3 C 1/ 15 sync // wait for spawns is the smaller of the two, lines 4 and 5 switch the roles of the subarrays so that AŒp 1 ; r 1 � refers to the larger subarray for the balance of the procedure. We’re now at the crux of P-MERGE-AUX: implementing the parallel divide-and- conquer strategy. As we continue our pseudocode walk, you may ûnd it helpful to refer again to Figure 26.6. First the divide step. Line 6 computes the midpoint q 1 of AŒp 1 W r 1 �, which in- dexes a median x D AŒq 1 � of this subarray to be used as the pivot, and line 7 determines x itself. Next, line 8 uses the FIND-SPLIT-POINT procedure to ûnd the index q 2 in AŒp 2 W r 2 � such that all elements in AŒp 2 W q 2  1� are at most x and all the elements in AŒq 2 W r 2 � are at least x . Line 9 computes the index q 3 of the element that divides the output subarray BŒp 3 W r 3 � into BŒp 3 W q 3  1� and BŒq 3 C 1 W r 3 �, and then line 10 puts x directly into BŒq 3 �, which is where it belongs in the output. Next is the conquer step, which is where the parallel recursion occurs. Lines 12 and 14 each spawn P-MERGE-AUX to recursively merge from A into B , the ûrst to merge the smaller elements and the second to merge the larger elements. The 780 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms sync statement in line 15 ensures that the subproblems ûnish before the procedure returns. There is no combine step, as BŒp W r� already contains the correct sorted output. Work/span analysis of parallel merging Let’s ûrst analyze the worst-case span T 1 .n/ of P-MERGE-AUX on input subar- rays that together contain a total of n elements. The call to FIND-SPLIT-POINT in line 8 contributes ‚.lg n/ to the span in the worst case, and the procedure performs at most a constant amount of additional serial work outside of the two recursive spawns in lines 12 and 14. Because the two recursive spawns operate logically in parallel, only one of them contributes to the overall worst-case span. We claimed earlier that neither recur- sive invocation ever operates on more than 3n=4 elements. Let’s see why. Let n 1 D r 1  p 1 C 1 and n 2 D r 2  p 2 C 1, where n D n 1 C n 2 , be the sizes of the two subarrays when line 6 starts executing, that is, after we have established that n 2 හ n 1 by swapping the roles of the two subarrays, if necessary. Since the pivot x is a median of of AŒp 1 W r 1 �, in the worst case, a recursive merge involves at most n 1 =2 elements of AŒp 1 W r 1 �, but it might involve all n 2 of the elements of AŒp 2 W r 2 �. Thus we can bound the number of elements involved in a recursive invocation of P-MERGE-AUX by n 1 =2 C n 2 D .2n 1 C 4n 2 /=4 හ .3n 1 C 3n 2 /=4 (since n 2 හ n 1 ) D 3n=4 ; proving the claim. The worst-case span of P-MERGE-AUX can therefore be described by the fol- lowing recurrence: 1 .n/ D T 1 .3n=4/ C ‚.lg n/ : (26.7) Because this recurrence falls under case 2 of the master theorem with k D 1, its solution is T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg 2 n/. Now let’s verify that the work T 1 .n/ of P-MERGE-AUX on n elements is linear. A lower bound of �.n/ is straightforward, since each of the n elements is copied from array A to array B . We’ll show that T 1 .n/ D O.n/ by deriving a recurrence for the worst-case work. The binary search in line 8 costs ‚.lg n/ in the worst case, which dominates the other work outside of the recursive spawns. For the recursive spawns, observe that although lines 12 and 14 might merge different numbers of elements, the two recursive spawns together merge at most n  1 elements (since x D AŒq� is not merged). Moreover, as we saw when analyzing the span, a recur- sive spawn operates on at most 3n=4 elements. We therefore obtain the recurrence 26.3 Parallel merge sort 781 1 .n/ D T 1 .˛ n/ C T 1 ..1  ˛/n/ C ‚.lg n/ ; (26.8) where ˛ lies in the range 1=4 හ ˛ හ 3=4. The value of ˛ can vary from one recursive invocation to another. We’ll use the substitution method (see Section 4.3) to prove that the above re- currence (26.8) has solution T 1 .n/ D O.n/. (You could also use the Akra-Bazzi method from Section 4.7.) Assume that T 1 .n/ හ c 1 n  c 2 lg n for some posi- tive constants c 1 and c 2 . Using the properties of logarithms on pages 663674in particular, to deduce that lg ˛ C lg.1  ˛/ D ‚.1/4substitution yields T 1 .n/ හ .c 1 ˛ n  c 2 lg.˛ n// C .c 1 .1  ˛/n  c 2 lg..1  ˛/n// C ‚.lg n/ D c 1 .˛ C .1  ˛//n  c 2 .lg.˛ n/ C lg..1  ˛/n// C ‚.lg n/ D c 1 n  c 2 .lg ˛ C lg n C lg.1  ˛/ C lg n/ C ‚.lg n/ D c 1 n  c 2 lg n  c 2 .lg n C lg ˛ C lg.1  ˛// C ‚.lg n/ D c 1 n  c 2 lg n  c 2 .lg n  ‚.1// C ‚.lg n/ හ c 1 n  c 2 lg n ; if we choose c 2 large enough that the c 2 .lg n  ‚.1// term dominates the ‚.lg n/ term for sufûciently large n. Furthermore, we can choose c 1 large enough to satisfy the implied ‚.1/ base cases of the recurrence, completing the induction. The lower and upper bounds of �.n/ and O.n/ give T 1 .n/ D ‚.n/, asymptotically the same work as for serial merging. The execution of the pseudocode in the P-MERGE procedure itself does not add asymptotically to the work and span of P-M ERGE-AUX. The parallel for loop in lines 334 has ‚.lg n/ span due to the loop control, and each iteration runs in constant time. Thus the ‚.lg 2 n/ span of P-MERGE-AUX dominates, yielding ‚.lg 2 n/ span overall for P-MERGE. The parallel for loop contains ‚.n/ work, matching the asymptotic work of P-MERGE-AUX and yielding ‚.n/ work overall for P-MERGE. Analysis of parallel merge sort The <heavy lifting= is done. Now that we have determined the work and span of P-MERGE, we can analyze P-MERGE-SORT. Let T 1 .n/ and T 1 .n/ be the work and span, respectively, of P-MERGE-SORT on an array of n elements. The call to P-MERGE in line 10 of P-MERGE-SORT dominates the costs of lines 133, for both work and span. Thus we obtain the recurrence 1 .n/ D 2T 1 .n=2/ C ‚.n/ for the work of P-MERGE-SORT, and we obtain the recurrence T 1 .n/ D T 1 .n=2/ C ‚.lg 2 n/ 782 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms for its span. The work recurrence has solution T 1 .n/ D ‚.n lg n/ by case 2 of the master theorem with k D 0. The span recurrence has solution T 1 .n/ D ‚.lg 3 n/, also by case 2 of the master theorem, but with k D 2. Parallel merging gives P-MERGE-SORT a parallelism advantage over P-NAIVE- MERGE-SORT. The parallelism of P-NAIVE-MERGE-SORT, which calls the serial MERGE procedure, is only ‚.lg n/. For P-MERGE-SORT, the parallelism is T 1 .n/=T 1 .n/ D ‚.n lg n/=‚.lg 3 n/ D ‚.n= lg 2 n/ ; which is much better, both in theory and in practice. A good implementation in practice would sacriûce some parallelism by coarsening the base case in order to reduce the constants hidden by the asymptotic notation. For example, you could switch to an efûcient serial sort, perhaps quicksort, when the number of elements to be sorted is sufûciently small. Exercises 26.3-1 Explain how to coarsen the base case of P-MERGE. 26.3-2 Instead of ûnding a median element in the larger subarray, as P-M ERGE does, sup- pose that the merge procedure ûnds a median of all the elements in the two sorted subarrays using the result of Exercise 9.3-10. Give pseudocode for an efûcient parallel merging procedure that uses this median-ûnding procedure.

The procedure has high parallelism, however: ‚.n 3 = log 2 n/. 784 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms For example, ignoring the constants in the ‚-notation, the parallelism for mul- tiplying 1000  1000 matrices comes to approximately 1000 3 =10 2 D 10 7 , since lg 1000  10.

A related problem is that of computing a ˝-scan, sometimes called a ˝-preûx computation, on an array xŒ1 W n�, where ˝ is once again an associative opera- tor. The ˝-scan, implemented by the serial procedure S CAN, produces the ar- ray yŒ1 W n� given by yŒ1� D xŒ1� ; yŒ2� D xŒ1� ˝ xŒ2� ; yŒ3� D xŒ1� ˝ xŒ2� ˝ xŒ3� ; : : : yŒn� D xŒ1� ˝ xŒ2� ˝ xŒ3� ˝    ˝ xŒn� ; that is, all preûxes of the array x <summed= using the ˝ operator.

The pattern of neighboring entries does not change during the computation and is called a stencil. For example, Section 14.4 presents a stencil algorithm to compute a longest common subsequence, where the value in entry cŒi; j � depends only on the values in cŒi  1; j �, cŒi; j  1�, and cŒi  1; j  1�, 788 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms as well as the elements x i and y j within the two sequences given as inputs. The input sequences are ûxed, but the algorithm ûlls in the two-dimensional array c so that it computes entry cŒi; j � after computing all three entries cŒi  1; j �, cŒi; j  1�, and cŒi  1; j  1�. This problem examines how to use recursive spawning to parallelize a simple stencil calculation on an n  n array A in which the value placed into entry AŒi; j � depends only on values in AŒi 0 ; j 0 �, where i 0 හ i and j 0 හ j (and of course, i 0 ¤ i or j 0 ¤ j ). In other words, the value in an entry depends only on values in entries that are above it and/or to its left, along with static information outside of the array. Furthermore, we assume throughout this problem that once the entries upon which AŒi; j � depends have been ûlled in, the entry AŒi; j � can be computed in ‚.1/ time (as in the LC S-LENGTH procedure of Section 14.4). Partition the n  n array A into four n=2  n=2 subarrays as follows: A D Ï A 11 A 12 A 21 A 22 Ð : (26.9) You can immediately ûll in subarray A 11 recursively, since it does not depend on the entries in the other three subarrays. Once the computation of A 11 ûnishes, you can ûll in A 12 and A 21 recursively in parallel, because although they both depend on A 11 , they do not depend on each other. Finally, you can ûll in A 22 recursively. a. Give parallel pseudocode that performs this simple stencil calculation using a divide-and-conquer algorithm SIMPLE-STENCIL based on the decomposi- tion (26.9) and the discussion above. (Don’t worry about the details of the base case, which depends on the speciûc stencil.) Give and solve recurrences for the work and span of this algorithm in terms of n. What is the parallelism? b. Modify your solution to part (a) to divide an n  n array into nine n=3  n=3 subarrays, again recursing with as much parallelism as possible. Analyze this algorithm. How much more or less parallelism does this algorithm have com- pared with the algorithm from part (a)? c. Generalize your solutions to parts (a) and (b) as follows. Choose an integer b  2. Divide an n  n array into b 2 subarrays, each of size n=b  n=b, recursing with as much parallelism as possible. In terms of n and b, what are the work, span, and parallelism of your algorithm? Argue that, using this approach, the parallelism must be o.n/ for any choice of b  2. (Hint: For this argument, show that the exponent of n in the parallelism is strictly less than 1 for any choice of b  2.) d. Give pseudocode for a parallel algorithm for this simple stencil calculation that achieves ‚.n= lg n/ parallelism. Argue using notions of work and span that Notes for Chapter 26 789 the problem has ‚.n/ inherent parallelism. Unfortunately, simple fork-join parallelism does not let you achieve this maximal parallelism. 26-6 Randomized parallel algorithms Like serial algorithms, parallel algorithms can employ random-number generators.

Chapter notes Parallel computers and algorithmic models for parallel programming have been around in various forms for years. Prior editions of this book included material on sorting networks and the PRAM (Parallel Random-Access Machine) model. The data-parallel model [58, 217] is another popular algorithmic programming model, which features operations on vectors and matrices as primitives. The notion of sequential consistency is due to Lamport [275]. Graham [197] and Brent [71] showed that there exist schedulers achieving the bound of Theorem 26.1. Eager, Zahorjan, and Lazowska [129] showed that 790 Chapter 26 Parallel Algorithms any greedy scheduler achieves this bound and proposed the methodology of us- ing work and span (although not by those names) to analyze parallel algorithms. Blelloch [57] developed an algorithmic programming model based on work and span (which he called <depth=) for data-parallel programming. Blumofe and Leiserson [63] gave a distributed scheduling algorithm for task-parallel computa- tions based on randomized <work-stealing= and showed that it achieves the bound E ŒT P � හ T 1 =P C O.T 1 /. Arora, Blumofe, and Plaxton [20] and Blelloch, Gib- bons, and Matias [61] also provided provably good algorithms for scheduling task- parallel computations. The recent literature contains many algorithms and strate- gies for scheduling parallel programs. The parallel pseudocode and programming model were inüuenced by Cilk [290, 291, 383, 396]. The open-source project OpenCilk (www.opencilk.org) provides Cilk programming as an extension to the C and C++ programming languages. All of the parallel algorithms in this chapter can be coded straightforwardly in Cilk. Concerns about nondeterministic parallel programs were expressed by Lee [281] and Bocchino, Adve, Adve, and Snir [64]. The algorithms literature contains many algorithmic strategies (see, for example, [60, 85, 118, 140, 160, 282, 283, 412, 461]) for detecting races and extending the fork-join model to avoid or safely em- brace various kinds of nondeterminism. Blelloch, Fineman, Gibbons, and Shun [59] showed that deterministic parallel algorithms can often be as fast as, or even faster than, their nondeterministic counterparts. Several of the parallel algorithms in this chapter appeared in unpublished lecture notes by C. E. Leiserson and H. Prokop and were originally implemented in Cilk. The parallel merge-sorting algorithm was inspired by an algorithm due to Akl [12]. 27 Online Algorithms Most problems described in this book have assumed that the entire input was avail- able before the algorithm executes. In many situations, however, the input becomes available not in advance, but only as the algorithm executes. This idea was implicit in much of the discussion of data structures in Part III. The reason that you want to design, for example, a data structure that can handle n I NSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH operations in O.lg n/ time per operation is most likely because you are going to receive n such operation requests without knowing in advance what oper- ations will be coming. This idea was also implicit in amortized analysis in Chap- ter 16, where we saw how to maintain a table that can grow or shrink in response to a sequence of insertion and deletion operations, yet with a constant amortized cost per operation. An online algorithm receives its input progressively over time, rather than hav- ing the entire input available at the start, as in an ofüine algorithm. Online algo- rithms pertain to many situations in which information arrives gradually. A stock trader must make decisions today, without knowing what the prices will be tomor- row, yet wants to achieve good returns. A computer system must schedule arriving jobs without knowing what work will need to be done in the future. A store must decide when to order more inventory without knowing what the future demand will be. A driver for a ride-hailing service must decide whether to pick up a fare without knowing who will request rides in the future. In each of these situations, and many more, algorithmic decisions must be made without knowledge of the future. There are several approaches for dealing with unknown future inputs. One ap- proach is to form a probabilistic model of future inputs and design an algorithm that assumes future inputs conform to the model. This technique is common, for example, in the ûeld of queuing theory, and it is also related to machine learning. Of course, you might not be able to develop a workable probabilistic model, or even if you can, some inputs might not conform to it. This chapter takes a differ- 792 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms ent approach. Instead of assuming anything about the future input, we employ a conservative strategy of limiting how poor a solution any input can entail. This chapter, therefore, adopts a worst-case approach, designing online algo- rithms that guarantee the quality of the solution for all possible future inputs. We’ll analyze online algorithms by comparing the solution produced by the online algo- rithm with a solution produced by an optimal algorithm that knows the future in- puts, and taking a worst-case ratio over all possible instances. We call this method- ology competitive analysis. We’ll use a similar approach when we study approx- imation algorithms in Chapter 35, where we’ll compare the solution returned by an algorithm that might be suboptimal with the value of the optimal solution, and determine a worst-case ratio over all possible instances. We start with a <toy= problem: deciding between whether to take the elevator or the stairs. This problem will introduce the basic methodology of thinking about online algorithms and how to analyze them via competitive analysis. We will then look at two problems that use competitive analysis. The ûrst is how to maintain a search list so that the access time is not too large, and the second is about strategies for deciding which cache blocks to evict from a cache or other kind of fast computer memory. 27.1 Waiting for an elevator Our ûrst example of an online algorithm models a problem that you likely have encountered yourself: whether you should wait for an elevator to arrive or just take the stairs. Suppose that you enter a building and wish to visit an ofûce that is k üoors up. You have two choices: walk up the stairs or take the elevator. Let’s assume, for convenience, that you can climb the stairs at the rate of one üoor per minute. The elevator travels much faster than you can climb the stairs: it can ascend all k üoors in just one minute. Your dilemma is that you do not know how long it will take for the elevator to arrive at the ground üoor and pick you up. Should you take the elevator or the stairs? How do you decide? Let’s analyze the problem. Taking the stairs takes k minutes, no matter what. Suppose you know that the elevator takes at most B  1 minutes to arrive for some value of B that is considerably higher than k. (The elevator could be going up when you call for it and then stop at several üoors on its way down.) To keep things simple, let’s also assume that the number of minutes for the elevator to arrive is an integer. Therefore, waiting for the elevator and taking it k üoors up takes anywhere from one minute (if the elevator is already at the ground üoor) to .B  1/ C 1 D B minutes (the worst case). Although you know B and k, you don’t know how long the elevator will take to arrive this time. You can use competitive 27.1 Waiting for an elevator 793 analysis to inform your decision regarding whether to take the stairs or elevator. In the spirit of competitive analysis, you want to be sure that, no matter what the future brings (i.e., how long the elevator takes to arrive), you will not wait much longer than a seer who knows when the elevator will arrive. Let us ûrst consider what the seer would do. If the seer knows that the elevator is going to arrive in at most k  1 minutes, the seer waits for the elevator, and otherwise, the seer takes the stairs. Letting m denote the number of minutes it takes for the elevator to arrive at the ground üoor, we can express the time that the seer spends as the function t.m/ D ( m C 1 if m හ k  1 ; k if m  k : (27.1) We typically evaluate online algorithms by their competitive ratio. Let U denote the set (universe) of all possible inputs, and consider some input I 2 U. For a minimization problem, such as the stairs-versus-elevator problem, if an online algorithm A produces a solution with value A.I / on input I and the solution from an algorithm F that knows the future has value F .I / on the same input, then the competitive ratio of algorithm A is max fA.I /=F .I / W I 2 Ug : If an online algorithm has a competitive ratio of c , we say that it is c -competitive. The competitive ratio is always at least 1, so that we want an online algorithm with a competitive ratio as close to 1 as possible. In the stairs-versus-elevator problem, the only input is the time for the eleva- tor to arrive. Algorithm F knows this information, but an online algorithm has to make a decision without knowing when the elevator will arrive. Consider the algorithm <always take the stairs,= which always takes exactly k minutes. Using equation (27.1), the competitive ratio is max fk=t.m/ W 0 හ m හ B  1g : (27.2) Enumerating the terms in equation (27.2) gives the competitive ratio as max ï k 1 ; k 2 ; k 3 ; : : : ; k .k  1/ ; k k ; k k ; : : : ; k k ð D k ; so that the competitive ratio is k. The maximum is achieved when the elevator arrives immediately. In this case, taking the stairs requires k minutes, but the optimal solution takes just 1 minute. Now let’s consider the opposite approach: <always take the elevator.= If it takes m minutes for the elevator to arrive at the ground üoor, then this algorithm will always take m C 1 minutes. Thus the competitive ratio becomes max f.m C 1/=t.m/ W 0 හ m හ B  1g ; 794 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms which we can again enumerate as max ï 1 1 ; 2 2 ; : : : ; k k ; k C 1 k ; k C 2 k ; : : : ; B k ð D B k : Now the maximum is achieved when the elevator takes B  1 minutes to arrive, compared with the optimal approach of taking the stairs, which requires k minutes. Hence, the algorithm <always take the stairs= has competitive ratio k, and the algorithm <always take the elevator= has competitive ratio B=k. Because we prefer the algorithm with smaller competitive ratio, if k D 10 and B D 300, we prefer <always take the stairs,= with competitive ratio 10, over <always take the elevator,= with competitive ratio 30. Taking the stairs is not always better, or necessarily more often better. It’s just that taking the stairs guards better against the worst-case future. These two approaches of always taking the stairs and always taking the elevator are extreme solutions, however. Instead, you can <hedge your bets= and guard even better against a worst-case future. In particular, you can wait for the elevator for a while, and then if it doesn’t arrive, take the stairs. How long is <a while=? Let’s say that <a while= is k minutes. Then the time h.m/ required by this hedging strategy, as a function of the number m of minutes before the elevator arrives, is h.m/ D ( m C 1 if m හ k ; 2k if m > k : In the second case, h.m/ D 2k because you wait for k minutes and then climb the stairs for k minutes. The competitive ratio is now max fh.m/=t.m/ W 0 හ m හ B  1g : Enumerating this ratio yields max ï 1 1 ; 2 2 ; : : : ; k k ; k C 1 k ; 2k k ; 2k k ; 2k k ; : : : ; 2k k ð D 2 : The competitive ratio is now independent of k and B . This example illustrates a common philosophy in online algorithms: we want an algorithm that guards against any possible worst case. Initially, waiting for the elevator guards against the case when the elevator arrives quickly, but eventually switching to the stairs guards against the case when the elevator takes a long time to arrive. 27.2 Maintaining a search list 795 Exercises 27.1-1 Suppose that when hedging your bets, you wait for p minutes, instead of for k minutes, before taking the stairs. What is the competitive ratio as a function of p and k? How should you choose p to minimize the competitive ratio? 27.1-2 Imagine that you decide to take up downhill skiing. Suppose that a pair of skis costs r dollars to rent for a day and b dollars to buy, where b > r . If you knew in advance how many days you would ever ski, your decision whether to rent or buy would be easy. If you’ll ski for at least db=r e days, then you should buy skis, and otherwise you should rent. This strategy minimizes the total that you ever spend. In reality, you don’t know in advance how many days you’ll eventually ski. Even after you have skied several times, you still don’t know how many more times you’ll ever ski. Yet you don’t want to waste your money. Give and analyze an algorithm that has a competitive ratio of 2, that is, an algorithm guaranteeing that, no matter how many times you ski, you never spend more than twice what you would have spent if you knew from the outset how many times you’ll ski. 27.1-3 In <concentration solitaire,= a game for one person, you have n pairs of matching cards. The backs of the cards are all the same, but the fronts contain pictures of animals. One pair has pictures of aardvarks, one pair has pictures of bears, one pair has pictures of camels, and so on. At the start of the game, the cards are all placed face down. In each round, you can turn two cards face up to reveal their pictures. If the pictures match, then you remove that pair from the game. If they don’t match, then you turn both of them over, hiding their pictures once again. The game ends when you have removed all n pairs, and your score is how many rounds you needed to do so. Suppose that you can remember the picture on every card that you have seen. Give an algorithm to play concentration solitaire that has a competitive ratio of 2. 27.2 Maintaining a search list The next example of an online algorithm pertains to maintaining the order of ele- ments in a linked list, as in Section 10.2. This problem often arises in practice for hash tables when collisions are resolved by chaining (see Section 11.2), since each slot contains a linked list. Reordering the linked list of elements in each slot of the hash table can boost the performance of searches measurably. 796 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms The list-maintenance problem can be set up as follows. You are given a list L of n elements fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g. We’ll assume that the list is doubly linked, although the algorithms and analysis work just as well for singly linked lists. Denote the position of element x i in the list L by r L .x i /, where 1 හ r L .x i / හ n. Calling LIST-SEARCH .L; x i / on page 260 thus takes ‚.r L .x i // time. If you know in advance something about the distribution of search requests, then it makes sense to arrange the list ahead of time to put the more frequently searched elements closer to the front, which minimizes the total cost (see Exercise 27.2-1). If instead you don’t know anything about the search sequence, then no matter how you arrange the list, it is possible that every search is for whatever element appears at the tail of the list. The total searching time would then be ‚.nm/, where m is the number of searches. If you notice patterns in the access sequence or you observe differences in the frequencies in which elements are accessed, then you might want to rearrange the list as you perform searches. For example, if you discover that every search is for a particular element, you could move that element to the front of the list. In general, you could rearrange the list after each call to LIST-SEARCH. But how would you do so without knowing the future? After all, no matter how you move elements around, every search could be for the last element. But it turns out that some search sequences are <easier= than others. Rather than just evaluate performance on the worst-case sequence, let’s compare a reorganiza- tion scheme with whatever an optimal ofüine algorithm would do if it knew the search sequence in advance. That way, if the sequence is fundamentally hard, the optimal ofüine algorithm will also ûnd it hard, but if the sequence is easy, we can hope to do reasonably well. To ease analysis, we’ll drop the asymptotic notation and say that the cost is just i to search for the i th element in the list. Let’s also assume that the only way to reorder the elements in the list is by swapping two adjacent elements in the list. Because the list is doubly linked, each swap incurs a cost of 1. Thus, for example, a search for the sixth element followed by moving it forward two places (entailing two swaps) incurs a total cost 8. The goal is to minimize the total cost of calls to LIST-SEARCH plus the total number of swaps performed. The online algorithm that we’ll explore is MOVE-TO-FRONT .L; x/. This proce- dure ûrst searches for x in the doubly linked list L, and then it moves x to the front of the list. 1 If x is located at position r D r L .x/ before the call, MOVE-TO-FRONT swaps x with the element in position r  1, then with the element in position r  2, 1 The path-compression heuristic in Section 19.3 resembles M OVE-TO-FRONT, although it would be more accurately expressed as <move-to-next-to-front.= Unlike MOVE-TO-FRONT in a doubly linked list, path compression can relocate multiple elements to become <next-to-front.= 27.2 Maintaining a search list 797 FORESEE MOVE-TO-FRONT search + search + element search swap swap cumulative search swap swap cumulative searched L cost cost cost cost L cost cost cost cost 5 h1; 2; 3; 4; 5i 5 0 5 5 h1; 2; 3; 4; 5i 5 4 9 9 3 h1; 2; 3; 4; 5i 3 3 6 11 h5; 1; 2; 3; 4i 4 3 7 16 4 h4; 1; 2; 3; 5i 1 0 1 12 h3; 5; 1; 2; 4i 5 4 9 25 4 h4; 1; 2; 3; 5i 1 0 1 13 h4; 3; 5; 1; 2i 1 0 1 26 Figure 27.1 The costs incurred by the procedures F ORESEE and MOVE-TO-FRONT when search- ing for the elements 5, 3, 4, and 4, starting with the list L D h1; 2; 3; 4; 5i. If FORESEE instead moved 3 to the front after the search for 5, the cumulative cost would not change, nor would the cumulative cost change if 4 moved to the second position after the search for 5. and so on, until it ûnally swaps x with the element in position 1. Thus if the call MOVE-TO-FRONT .L; 8/ executes on the list L D h5; 3; 12; 4; 8; 9; 22i, the list becomes h8; 5; 3; 12; 4; 9; 22i. The call MOVE-TO-FRONT .L; k/ costs 2r L .k/  1: it costs r L .k/ to search for k, and it costs 1 for each of the r L .k/  1 swaps that move k to the front of the list. We’ll see that MOVE-TO-FRONT has a competitive ratio of 4. Let’s think about what this means. MOVE-TO-FRONT performs a series of operations on a doubly linked list, accumulating cost. For comparison, suppose that there is an algorithm FORESEE that knows the future. Like MOVE-TO-FRONT, it also searches the list and moves elements around, but after each call it optimally rearranges the list for the future. (There may be more than one optimal order.) Thus FORESEE and MOVE-TO-FRONT maintain different lists of the same elements. Consider the example shown in Figure 27.1. Starting with the list h1; 2; 3; 4; 5i , four searches occur, for the elements 5, 3, 4, and 4. The hypothetical procedure FORESEE, after searching for 3, moves 4 to the front of the list, knowing that a search for 4 is imminent. It thus incurs a swap cost of 3 upon its second call, after which no further swap costs accrue. M OVE-TO-FRONT incurs swap costs in each step, moving the found element to the front. In this example, M OVE-TO-FRONT has a higher cost in each step, but that is not necessarily always the case. The key to proving the competitive bound is to show that at any point, the total cost of MOVE-TO-FRONT is not much higher than that of FORESEE. Surprisingly, we can determine a bound on the costs incurred by M OVE-TO-FRONT relative to FORESEE even though MOVE-TO-FRONT cannot see the future. If we compare any particular step, MOVE-TO-FRONT and FORESEE may be op- erating on very different lists and do very different things. If we focus on the search for 4 above, we observe that FORESEE actually moves it to the front of the list early, paying to move the element to the front before it is accessed. To capture this con- 798 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms cept, we use the idea of an inversion: a pair of elements, say a and b, in which a appears before b in one list, but b appears before a in another list. For two lists L and L 0 , let I.L; L 0 /, called the inversion count, denote the number of inversions between the two lists, that is, the number of pairs of elements whose order differs in the two lists. For example, with lists L D h5; 3; 1; 4; 2i and L 0 D h3; 1; 2; 4; 5i, then out of the ã 5 2 ä D 10 pairs, exactly ûve of them4.1; 5/; .2; 4/; .2; 5/; .3; 5/; .4; 5/ 4are inversions, since these pairs, and only these pairs, appear in different orders in the two lists. Thus the inversion count is I.L; L 0 / D 5. In order to analyze the algorithm, we deûne the following notation. Let L M i be the list maintained by MOVE-TO-FRONT immediately after the i th search, and similarly, let L F i be FORESEE’s list immediately after the i th search. Let c M i and c F i be the costs incurred by MOVE-TO-FRONT and FORESEE on their i th calls, respectively. We don’t know how many swaps F ORESEE performs in its i th call, but we’ll denote that number by t i . Therefore, if the i th operation is a search for element x , then c M i D 2r L M i 1 .x/  1 ; (27.3) c F i D r L F i 1 .x/ C t i : (27.4) In order to compare these costs more carefully, let’s break down the elements into subsets, depending on their positions in the two lists before the i th search, relative to the element x being searched for in the i th search. We deûne three sets: BB D felements before x in both L M i 1 and L F i 1 g ; BA D felements before x in L M i 1 but after x in L F i 1 g ; AB D felements after x in L M i 1 but before x in L F i 1 g : We can now relate the position of element x in L F i 1 and L M i 1 to the sizes of these sets: L M i 1 .x/ D jBBj C jBAj C 1 ; (27.5) r L F i 1 .x/ D jBBj C jABj C 1 : (27.6) When a swap occurs in one of the lists, it changes the relative positions of the two elements involved, which in turn changes the inversion count. Suppose that elements x and y are swapped in some list. Then the only possible difference in the inversion count between this list and any other list depends on whether .x; y/ is an inversion. In fact, the inversion count of .x; y/ with respect to any other list must change. If .x; y/ is an inversion before the swap, it no longer is afterward, and vice versa. Therefore, if two consecutive elements x and y swap positions in a list L, then for any other list L 0 , the value of the inversion count I.L; L 0 / either increases by 1 or decreases by 1. 27.2 Maintaining a search list 799 As we compare MOVE-TO-FRONT and FORESEE searching and modifying their lists, we’ll think about MOVE-TO-FRONT executing on its list for the i th time and then FORESEE executing on its list for the i th time. After MOVE-TO-FRONT has executed for the i th time and before FORESEE has executed for the i th time, we’ll compare I.L M i 1 ; L F i 1 / (the inversion count immediately before the i th call of MOVE-TO-FRONT) with I.L M i ; L F i 1 / (the inversion count after the i th call of MOVE-TO-FRONT but before the i th call of FORESEE). We’ll concern ourselves later with what FORESEE does. Let us analyze what happens to the inversion count after executing the i th call of MOVE-TO-FRONT, and suppose that it searches for element x . More precisely, we’ll compute I.L M i ; L F i 1 /  I.L M i 1 ; L F i 1 /, the change in the inversion count, which gives a rough idea of how much M OVE-TO-FRONT’s list becomes more or less like FORESEE’s list. After searching, MOVE-TO-FRONT performs a series of swaps with each of the elements on the list L M i 1 that precedes x . Using the notation above, the number of such swaps is jBBj C jBAj. Bearing in mind that the list L F i 1 has yet to be changed by the i th call of FORESEE, let’s see how the inversion count changes. Consider a swap with an element y 2 BB. Before the swap, y precedes x in both L M i 1 and L F i 1 . After the swap, x precedes y in L M i , and L F i 1 does not change. Therefore, the inversion count increases by 1 for each element in BB. Now consider a swap with an element ´ 2 BA. Before the swap, ´ precedes x in L M i 1 but x precedes ´ in L F i 1 . After the swap, x precedes ´ in both lists. Therefore, the inversion count decreases by 1 for each element in BA. Thus altogether, the inversion count increases by I.L M i ; L F i 1 /  I.L M i 1 ; L F i 1 / D jBBj  jBAj : (27.7) We have laid the groundwork needed to analyze MOVE-TO-FRONT. Theorem 27.1 Algorithm MOVE-TO-FRONT has a competitive ratio of 4. Proof The proof uses a potential function, as described in Chapter 16 on amor- tized analysis. The value ˆ i of the potential function after the i th calls of MOVE- TO-FRONT and FORESEE depends on the inversion count: ˆ i D 2I.L M i ; L F i / : (Intuitively, the factor of 2 embodies the notion that each inversion represents a cost of 2 for MOVE-TO-FRONT relative to FORESEE: 1 for searching and 1 for swapping.) By equation (27.7), after the i th call of MOVE-TO-FRONT, but before the i th call of FORESEE, the potential increases by 2.jBBj  jBAj/. Since the inversion count of the two lists is nonnegative, we have ˆ i  0 for all i  0. 800 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms Assuming that MOVE-TO-FRONT and FORESEE start with the same list, the initial potential ˆ 0 is 0, so that ˆ i  ˆ 0 for all i . Drawing from equation (16.2) on page 456, the amortized cost y c M i of the i th MOVE-TO-FRONT operation is y c M i D c M i C ˆ i  ˆ i 1 ; where c M i , the actual cost of the i th MOVE-TO-FRONT operation, is given by equation (27.3): c M i D 2r L M i 1 .x/  1 : Now, let’s consider the potential change ˆ i  ˆ i 1 . Since both L M and L F change, let’s consider the changes to one list at a time. Recall that when MOVE- TO-FRONT moves element x to the front, it increases the potential by exactly 2.jBBj  jBAj/. We now consider how the optimal algorithm FORESEE changes its list L F : it performs t i swaps. Each swap performed by F ORESEE either increases or decreases the potential by 2, and thus the increase in potential by F ORESEE in the i th call can be at most 2t i . We therefore have y c M i D c M i C ˆ i  ˆ i 1 හ 2r L M i 1 .x/  1 C 2.jBBj  jBAj C t i / D 2r L M i 1 .x/  1 C 2.jBBj  .r L M i 1 .x/  1  jBBj/ C t i / (by equation (27.5)) D 4 jBBj C 1 C 2t i හ 4 jBBj C 4 jABj C 4 C 4t i (increasing some terms) D 4.jBBj C jABj C 1 C t i / D 4.r L F i 1 .x/ C t i / (by equation (27.6)) D 4c F i (by equation (27.4)) . (27.8) We now ûnish the proof as in Chapter 16 by showing that the total amortized cost provides an upper bound on the total actual cost, because the initial potential function is 0 and the potential function is always nonnegative. By equation (16.3) on page 456, for any sequence of m MOVE-TO-FRONT operations, we have m X i D1 y c M i D m X i D1 c M i C ˆ m  ˆ 0  m X i D1 c M i (because ˆ m  ˆ 0 ) . (27.9) 27.2 Maintaining a search list 801 Therefore, we have m X i D1 c M i හ m X i D1 y c M i (by equation (27.9)) හ m X i D1 4c F i (by equation (27.8)) D 4 m X i D1 c F i : Thus the total cost of the m MOVE-TO-FRONT operations is at most 4 times the total cost of the m FORESEE operations, so MOVE-TO-FRONT is 4-competitive. Isn’t it amazing that we can compare M OVE-TO-FRONT with the optimal algo- rithm FORESEE when we have no idea of the swaps that FORESEE makes? We were able to relate the performance of MOVE-TO-FRONT to the optimal algorithm by capturing how particular properties (swaps in this case) must evolve relative to the optimal algorithm, without actually knowing the optimal algorithm. The online algorithm MOVE-TO-FRONT has a competitive ratio of 4: on any input sequence, it incurs a cost at most 4 times that of any other algorithm. On a particular input sequence, it could cost much less than 4 times the optimal algo- rithm, perhaps even matching the optimal algorithm. Exercises 27.2-1 You are given a set S D fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g of n elements, and you wish to make a static list L (no rearranging once the list is created) containing the elements of S that is good for searching. Suppose that you have a probability distribution, where p.x i / is the probability that a given search searches for element x i . Argue that the expected cost for m searches is m n X i D1 p.x i /  r L .x i / : Prove that this sum is minimized when the elements of L are sorted in decreasing order with respect to p.x i /. 27.2-2 Professor Carnac claims that since FORESEE is an optimal algorithm that knows the future, then at each step it must incur no more cost than M OVE-TO-FRONT. Either prove that Professor Carnac is correct or provide a counterexample. 802 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms 27.2-3 Another way to maintain a linked list for efûcient searching is for each element to maintain a frequency count: the number of times that the element has been searched for. The idea is to rearrange list elements after searches so that the list is always sorted by decreasing frequency count, from largest to smallest. Either show that this algorithm is O.1/-competitive, or prove that it is not. 27.2-4 The model in this section charged a cost of 1 for each swap. We can consider an alternative cost model in which, after accessing x , you can move x anywhere earlier in the list, and there is no cost for doing so. The only cost is the cost of the actual accesses. Show that M OVE-TO-FRONT is 2-competitive in this cost model, assuming that the number requests is sufûciently large. (Hint: Use the potential function ˆ i D I.L M i ; L F i /.) 27.3 Online caching In Section 15.4, we studied the caching problem, in which blocks of data from the main memory of a computer are stored in the cache: a small but faster memory. In that section, we studied the ofüine version of the problem, in which we assumed that we knew the sequence of memory requests in advance, and we designed an algorithm to minimize the number of cache misses. In almost all computer sys- tems, caching is, in fact, an online problem. We do not generally know the series of cache requests in advance; they are presented to the algorithm only as the re- quests for blocks are actually made. To gain a better understanding of this more realistic scenario, we analyze online algorithms for caching. We will ûrst see that all deterministic online algorithms for caching have a lower bound of �.k/ for the competitive ratio, where k is the size of the cache. We will then present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of ‚.n/, where the input size is n, and one with a competitive ratio of O.k/, which matches the lower bound. We will end by showing how to use randomization to design an algorithm with a much better competitive ratio of ‚.lg k/. We will also discuss the assumptions that underlie randomized online algorithms, via the notion of an adversary, such as we saw in Chapter 11 and will see in Chapter 31. You can ûnd the terminology used to describe the caching problem in Sec- tion 15.4, which you might wish to review before proceeding. 27.3 Online caching 803 27.3.1 Deterministic caching algorithms In the caching problem, the input comprises a sequence of n memory requests, for data in blocks b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n , in that order. The blocks requested are not necessarily distinct: each block may appear multiple times within the request sequence. After block b i is requested, it resides in a cache that can hold up to k blocks, where k is a ûxed cache size. We assume that n > k, since otherwise we are assured that the cache can hold all the requested blocks at once. When a block b i is requested, if it is already in the cache, then a cache hit occurs and the cache remains unchanged. If b i is not in the cache, then a cache miss occurs. If the cache contains fewer than k blocks upon a cache miss, block b i is placed into the cache, which now contains one block more than before. If a cache miss occurs with an already full cache, however, some block must be evicted from the cache before b i can enter. Thus, a caching algorithm must decide which block to evict from the cache upon a cache miss when the cache is full. The goal is to minimize the number of cache misses over the entire request sequence. The caching algorithms considered in this chapter differ only in which block they decide to evict upon a cache miss. We do not consider abilities such as prefetching, in which a block is brought into the cache before an upcoming request in order to avert a future cache miss. There are many online caching policies to determine which block to evict, in- cluding the following: First-in, ûrst-out (FIFO): evict the block that has been in the cache the longest time.  Last-in, ûrst-out (LIFO): evict the block that has been in the cache the shortest time.  Least Recently Used (LRU): evict the block whose last use is furthest in the past.  Least Frequently Used (LFU): evict the block that has been accessed the fewest times, breaking ties by choosing the block that has been in the cache the longest. To analyze these algorithms, we assume that the cache starts out empty, so that no evictions occur during the ûrst k requests. We wish to compare the perfor- mance of an online algorithm to an optimal ofüine algorithm that knows the future requests. As we will soon see, all these deterministic online algorithms have a lower bound of �.k/ for their competitive ratio. Some deterministic algorithms also have a competitive ratio with an O.k/ upper bound, but some other determin- istic algorithms are considerably worse, having a competitive ratio of ‚.n=k/. We now proceed to analyze the LIFO and LRU policies. In addition to assuming that n > k, we will assume that at least k distinct blocks are requested. Otherwise, the cache never ûlls up and no blocks are evicted, so that all algorithms exhibit the same behavior. We begin by showing that LIFO has a large competitive ratio. 804 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms Theorem 27.2 LIFO has a competitive ratio of ‚.n=k/ for the online caching problem with n requests and a cache of size k. Proof We ûrst show a lower bound of �.n=k/. Suppose that the input consists of k C 1 blocks, numbered 1; 2; : : : ; k C 1, and the request sequence is 1; 2; 3; 4; : : : ; k; k C 1; k; k C 1; k; k C 1; : : : ; where after the initial 1; 2; : : : ; k; k C 1, the remainder of the sequence alternates between k and k C 1, with a total of n requests. The sequence ends on block k if n and k are either both even or both odd, and otherwise, the sequence ends on block kC1. That is, b i D i for i D 1; 2; : : : k1, b i D kC1 for i D kC1; kC3; : : : and b i D k for i D k; k C 2; : : :. How many blocks does LIFO evict? After the ûrst k requests (which are considered to be cache misses), the cache is ûlled with blocks 1; 2; : : : ; k. The .k C 1/st request, which is for block k C 1, causes block k to be evicted. The .k C 2/nd request, which is for block k, forces block k C 1 to be evicted, since that block was just placed into the cache. This behavior continues, alternately evicting blocks k and k C 1 for the remaining requests. LIFO, therefore, suffers a cache miss on every one of the n requests. The optimal ofüine algorithm knows the entire sequence of requests in advance. Upon the ûrst request of block k C 1, it just evicts any block except block k, and then it never evicts another block. Thus, the optimal ofüine algorithm evicts only once. Since the ûrst k requests are considered cache misses, the total number of cache misses is k C 1. The competitive ratio, therefore, is n=.k C 1/, or �.n=k/. For the upper bound, observe that on any input of size n, any caching algorithm incurs at most n cache misses. Because the input contains at least k distinct blocks, any caching algorithm, including the optimal ofüine algorithm, must incur at least k cache misses. Therefore, LIFO has a competitive ratio of O.n=k/. We call such a competitive ratio unbounded, because it grows with the input size. Exercise 27.3-2 asks you to show that LFU also has an unbounded competitive ratio. FIFO and LRU have a much better competitive ratio of ‚.k/. There is a big difference between competitive ratios of ‚.n=k/ and ‚.k/. The cache size k is independent of the input sequence and does not grow as more requests arrive over time. A competitive ratio that depends on n, on the other hand, does grow with the size of the input sequence and thus can get quite large. It is preferable to use an algorithm with a competitive ratio that does not grow with the input sequence’s size, when possible. We now show that LRU has a competitive ratio of ‚.k/, ûrst showing the upper bound. 27.3 Online caching 805 Theorem 27.3 LRU has a competitive ratio of O.k/ for the online caching problem with n requests and a cache of size k. Proof To analyze LRU, we will divide the sequence of requests into epochs. Epoch 1 begins with the ûrst request. Epoch i , for i > 1, begins upon encoun- tering the .k C 1/st distinct request since the beginning of epoch i  1. Consider the following example of requests with k D 3: 1; 2; 1; 5; 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2; 3; 4; 5; 2; 2; 1; 2; 2 : (27.10) The ûrst k D 3 distinct requests are for blocks 1, 2 and 5, so epoch 2 begins with the ûrst request for block 4. In epoch 2, the ûrst 3 distinct requests are for blocks 4, 1, and 2. Requests for these blocks recur until the request for block 3, and with this request epoch 3 begins. Thus, this example has four epochs: 1; 2; 1; 5 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 2; 1; 2; 2 : (27.11) Now we consider the behavior of LRU. In each epoch, the ûrst time a re- quest for a particular block appears, it may cause a cache miss, but subsequent requests for that block within the epoch cannot cause a cache miss, since the block is now one of the k most recently used. For example, in epoch 2, the ûrst request for block 4 causes a cache miss, but the subsequent requests for block 4 do not. (Exercise 27.3-1 asks you to show the contents of the cache after each request.) In epoch 3, requests for blocks 3 and 5 cause cache misses, but the request for block 4 does not, because it was recently accessed in epoch 2. Since only the ûrst request for a block within an epoch can cause a cache miss and the cache holds k blocks, each epoch incurs at most k cache misses. Now consider the behavior of the optimal algorithm. The ûrst request in each epoch must cause a cache miss, even for an optimal algorithm. The miss occurs be- cause, by the deûnition of an epoch, there must have been k other blocks accessed since the last access to this block. Since, for each epoch, the optimal algorithm incurs at least one miss and LRU incurs at most k, the competitive ratio is at most k=1 D O.k/. Exercise 27.3-3 asks you to show that FIFO also has a competitive ratio of O.k/. We could show lower bounds of �.k/ on LRU and FIFO, but in fact, we can make a much stronger statement: any deterministic online caching algorithm must have a competitive ratio of �.k/. The proof relies on an adversary who knows the online algorithm being used and can tailor the future requests to cause the online algorithm to incur more cache misses than the optimal ofüine algorithm. Consider a scenario in which the cache has size k and the set of possible blocks to request is f1; 2; : : : ; k C 1g. The ûrst k requests are for blocks 1; 2; : : : ; k, so 806 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms that both the adversary and the deterministic online algorithm place these blocks into the cache. The next request is for block k C 1. In order to make room in the cache for block k C 1, the online algorithm evicts some block b 1 from the cache. The adversary, knowing that the online algorithm has just evicted block b 1 , makes the next request be for b 1 , so that the online algorithm must evict some other block b 2 to clear room in the cache for b 1 . As you might have guessed, the adversary makes the next request be for block b 2 , so that the online algorithm evicts some other block b 3 to make room for b 2 . The online algorithm and the adversary continue in this manner. The online algorithm incurs a cache miss on every request and therefore incurs n cache misses over the n requests. Now let’s consider an optimal ofüine algorithm, which knows the future. As dis- cussed in Section 15.4, this algorithm is known as furthest-in-future, and it always evicts the block whose next request is furthest in the future. Since there are only k C 1 unique blocks, when furthest-in-future evicts a block, we know that it will not be accessed during at least the next k requests. Thus, after the ûrst k cache misses, the optimal algorithm incurs a cache miss at most once every k requests. Therefore, the number of cache misses over n requests is at most k C n=k. Since the deterministic online algorithm incurs n cache misses and the optimal ofüine algorithm incurs at most k C n=k cache misses, the competitive ratio is at least n k C n=k D nk n C k 2 : For n  k 2 , the above expression is at least nk n C k 2  nk 2n D k 2 : Thus, for sufûciently long request sequences, we have shown the following: Theorem 27.4 Any deterministic online algorithm for caching with a cache size of k has compet- itive ratio �.k/. Although we can analyze the common caching strategies from the point of view of competitive analysis, the results are somewhat unsatisfying. Yes, we can dis- tinguish between algorithms with a competitive ratio of ‚.k/ and those with un- bounded competitive ratios. In the end, however, all of these competitive ratios are rather high. The online algorithms we have seen so far are deterministic, and it is this property that the adversary is able to exploit. 27.3 Online caching 807 27.3.2 Randomized caching algorithms If we don’t limit ourselves to deterministic online algorithms, we can use random- ization to develop an online caching algorithm with a signiûcantly smaller compet- itive ratio. Before describing the algorithm, let’s discuss randomization in online algorithms in general. Recall that we analyze online algorithms with respect to an adversary who knows the online algorithm and can design requests knowing the decisions made by the online algorithm. With randomization, we must ask whether the adversary also knows the random choices made by the online algorithm. An ad- versary who does not know the random choices is oblivious, and an adversary who knows the random choices is nonoblivious. Ideally, we prefer to design algorithms against a nonoblivious adversary, as this adversary is stronger than an oblivious one. Unfortunately, a nonoblivious adversary mitigates much of the power of ran- domness, as an adversary who knows the outcome of random choices typically can act as if the online algorithm is deterministic. The oblivious adversary, on the other hand, does not know the random choices of the online algorithm, and that is the adversary we typically use. As a simple illustration of the difference between an oblivious and nonoblivious adversary, imagine that you are üipping a fair coin n times, and the adversary wants to know how many heads you üipped. A nonoblivious adversary knows, after each üip, whether the coin came up heads or tails, and hence knows how many heads you üipped. An oblivious adversary, on the other hand, knows only that you are üipping a fair coin n times. The oblivious adversary, therefore, can reason that the number of heads follows a binomial distribution, so that the expected number of heads is n=2 (by equation (C.41) on page 1199) and the variance is n=4 (by equation (C.44) on page 1200). But the oblivious adversary has no way of knowing exactly how many heads you actually üipped. Let’s return to caching. We’ll start with a deterministic algorithm and then ran- domize it. The algorithm we’ll use is an approximation of LRU called MARKING. Rather than <least recently used,= think of M ARKING as simply <recently used.= MARKING maintains a 1-bit attribute mark for each block in the cache. Initially, all blocks in the cache are unmarked. When a block is requested, if it is already in the cache, it is marked. If the request is a cache miss, MARKING checks to see whether there are any unmarked blocks in the cache. If all blocks are marked, then they are all changed to unmarked. Now, regardless of whether all blocks in the cache were marked when the request occurred, there is at least one unmarked block in the cache, and so an arbitrary unmarked block is evicted, and the requested block is placed into the cache and marked. How should the block to evict from among the unmarked blocks in the cache be chosen? The procedure R ANDOMIZED-MARKING on the next page shows the 808 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms process when the block is chosen randomly. The procedure takes as input a block b being requested. RANDOMIZED-MARKING .b/ 1 if block b resides in the cache, 2 b: mark D 1 3 else 4 if all blocks b 0 in the cache have b 0 : mark D 1 5 unmark all blocks b 0 in the cache, setting b 0 : mark D 0 6 select an unmarked block u with u: mark D 0 uniformly at random 7 evict block u 8 place block b into the cache 9 b: mark D 1 For the purpose of analysis, we say that a new epoch begins immediately after each time line 5 executes. An epoch starts with no marked blocks in the cache. The ûrst time a block is requested during an epoch, the number of marked blocks increases by 1, and any subsequent requests to that block do not change the num- ber of marked blocks. Therefore, the number of marked blocks monotonically increases within an epoch. Under this view, epochs are the same as in the proof of Theorem 27.3: with a cache that holds k blocks, an epoch comprises requests for k distinct blocks (possibly fewer for the ûnal epoch), and the next epoch begins upon a request for a block not in those k. Because we are going to analyze a randomized algorithm, we will compute the expected competitive ratio. Recall that for an input I , we denote the solution value of an online algorithm A by A.I / and the solution value of an optimal algorithm F by F .I /. Online algorithm A has an expected competitive ratio c if for all inputs I , we have E ŒA.I /� හ cF .I / ; (27.12) where the expectation is taken over the random choices made by A. Although the deterministic MARKING algorithm has a competitive ratio of ‚.k/ (Theorem 27.4 provides the lower bound and see Exercise 27.3-4 for the upper bound), RANDOMIZED-MARKING has a much smaller expected competitive ratio, namely O.lg k/. The key to the improved competitive ratio is that the adversary cannot always make a request for a block that is not in the cache, since an oblivious adversary does not know which blocks are in the cache. 27.3 Online caching 809 Theorem 27.5 RANDOMIZED-MARKING has an expected competitive ratio of O.lg k/ for the online caching problem with n requests and a cache of size k, against an oblivious adversary. Before proving Theorem 27.5, we prove a basic probabilistic fact. Lemma 27.6 Suppose that a bag contains x C y balls: x  1 blue balls, y white balls, and 1 red ball. You repeatedly choose a ball at random and remove it from the bag until you have chosen a total of m balls that are either blue or red, where m හ x . You set aside each white ball you choose. Then, one of the balls chosen is the red ball with probability m=x . Proof Choosing a white ball does not affect how many blue or red balls are cho- sen in any way. Therefore, we can continue the analysis as if there were no white balls and the bag contains just x  1 blue balls and 1 red ball. Let A be the event that the red ball is not chosen, and let A i be the event that the i th draw does not choose the red ball. By equation (C.22) on page 1190, we have Pr fAg D Pr fA 1 \\ A 2 \\    \\ A m g D Pr fA 1 g  Pr fA 2 j A 1 g  Pr fA 3 j A 1 \\ A 2 g    Pr fA m j A 1 \\ A 2 \\    \\ A m1 g : (27.13) The probability Pr fA 1 g that the ûrst ball is blue equals .x  1/=x , since initially there are x  1 blue balls and 1 red ball. More generally, we have Pr fA i j A 1 \\    \\ A i 1 g D x  i x  i C 1 ; (27.14) since the i th draw is from x  i blue balls and 1 red ball. Equations (27.13) and (27.14) give Pr fAg D Ï x  1 x ÐÏ x  2 x  1 ÐÏ x  3 x  2 Ð    Ï x  m C 1 x  m C 2 ÐÏ x  m x  m C 1 Ð : (27.15) The right-hand side of equation (27.15) is a telescoping product, similar to the telescoping series in equation (A.12) on page 1143. The numerator of one term equals the denominator of the next, so that everything except the ûrst denominator and last numerator cancel, and we obtain Pr fAg D .x  m/=x . Since we actually want to compute Pr ˚ N A  D 1  Pr fAg, that is, the probability that the red ball is chosen, we get Pr ˚ N A  D 1  .x  m/=x D m=x . Now we can prove Theorem 27.5. 810 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms Proof We’ll analyze RANDOMIZED-MARKING one epoch at a time. Within epoch i , any request for a block b that is not the ûrst request for block b in epoch i must result in a cache hit, since after the ûrst request in epoch i , block b resides in the cache and is marked, so that it cannot be evicted during the epoch. Therefore, since we are counting cache misses, we’ll consider only the ûrst request for each block within each epoch, disregarding all other requests. We can classify the requests in an epoch as either old or new. If block b resides in the cache at the start of epoch i , each request for block b during epoch i is an old request. Old requests in epoch i are for blocks requested in epoch i  1. If a request in epoch i is not old, it is a new request, and it is for a block not requested in epoch i  1. All requests in epoch 1 are new. For example, let’s look again at the request sequence in example (27.11): 1; 2; 1; 5 4; 4; 1; 2; 4; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 2; 1; 2; 2 : Since we can disregard all requests for a block within an epoch other than the ûrst request, to analyze the cache behavior, we can view this request sequence as just 1; 2; 5 4; 1; 2 3; 4; 5 2; 1 : All three requests in epoch 1 are new. In epoch 2, the requests for blocks 1 and 2 are old, but the request for block 4 is new. In epoch 3, the request for block 4 is old, and the requests for blocks 3 and 5 are new. Both requests in epoch 4 are new. Within an epoch, each new request must cause a cache miss since, by deûnition, the block is not already in the cache. An old request, on the other hand, may or may not cause a cache miss. The old block is in the cache at the beginning of the epoch, but other requests might cause it to be evicted. Returning to our example, in epoch 2, the request for block 4 must cause a cache miss, as this request is new. The request for block 1, which is old, may or may not cause a cache miss. If block 1 was evicted when block 4 was requested, then a cache miss occurs and block 1 must be brought back into the cache. If instead block 1 was not evicted when block 4 was requested, then the request for block 1 results in a cache hit. The request for block 2 could incur a cache miss under two scenarios. One is if block 2 was evicted when block 4 was requested. The other is if block 1 was evicted when block 4 was requested, and then block 2 was evicted when block 1 was requested. We see that, within an epoch, each ensuing old request has an increasing chance of causing a cache miss. Because we consider only the ûrst request for each block within an epoch, we assume that each epoch contains exactly k requests, and each request within an epoch is for a unique block. (The last epoch might contain fewer than k requests. If it does, just add dummy requests to ûll it out to k requests.) In epoch i , denote the number of new requests by r i  1 (an epoch must contain at least one new 27.3 Online caching 811 request), so that the number of old requests is k  r i . As mentioned above, a new request always incurs a cache miss. Let us now focus on an arbitrary epoch i to obtain a bound on the expected number of cache misses within that epoch. In particular, let’s think about the j th old request within the epoch, where 1 හ j < k. Denote by b ij the block requested in the j th old request of epoch i , and denote by n ij and o ij the number of new and old requests, respectively, that occur within epoch i but before the j th old request. Because j  1 old requests occur before the j th old request, we have o ij D j  1. We will show that the probability of a cache miss upon the j th old request is n ij =.k  o ij /, or n ij =.k  j C 1/. Start by considering the ûrst old request, for block b i;1 . What is the probability that this request causes a cache miss? It causes a cache miss precisely when one of the n i;1 previous requests resulted in b i;1 being evicted. We can determine the probability that b i;1 was chosen for eviction by using Lemma 27.6: consider the k blocks in the cache to be k balls, with block b i;1 as the red ball, the other k  1 blocks as the k  1 blue balls, and no white balls. Each of the n i;1 requests chooses a block to evict with equal probability, corresponding to drawing balls n i;1 times. Thus, we can apply Lemma 27.6 with x D k, y D 0, and m D n i;1 , deriving the probability of a cache miss upon the ûrst old request as n i;1 =k, which equals n ij =.k  j C 1/ since j D 1. In order to determine the probability of a cache miss for subsequent old requests, we’ll need an additional observation. Let’s consider the second old request, which is for block b i;2 . This request causes a cache miss precisely when one of the pre- vious requests evicts b i;2 . Let’s consider two cases, based on the request for b i;1 . In the ûrst case, suppose that the request for b i;1 did not cause an eviction, because b i;1 was already in the cache. Then, the only way that b i;2 could have been evicted is by one of the n i;2 new requests that precedes it. What is the probability that this eviction happens? There are n i;2 chances for b i;2 to be evicted, but we also know that there is one block in the cache, namely b i;1 , that is not evicted. Thus, we can again apply Lemma 27.6, but with b i;1 as the white ball, b i;2 as the red ball, the remaining blocks as the blue balls, and drawing balls n i;2 times. Applying Lemma 27.6, with x D k  1, y D 1, and m D n i;2 , we ûnd that the probability of a cache miss is n i;2 =.k  1/. In the second case, the request for b i;1 does cause an eviction, which can happen only if one of the new requests preceding the request for b i;1 evicts b i;1 . Then, the request for b i;1 brings b i;1 back into the cache and evicts some other block. In this case, we know that of the new requests, one of them did not result in b i;2 being evicted, since b i;1 was evicted. Therefore, n i;2  1 new requests could evict b i;2 , as could the request for b i;1 , so that the number of requests that could evict b i;2 is n i;2 . Each such request evicts a block chosen from among k  1 blocks, since the request that resulted in evicting b i;1 did not also cause b i;2 to be evicted. Therefore, we can apply Lemma 27.6, with x D k  1, 812 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms y D 1, and m D n i;2 , and get that the probability of a miss is n i;2 =.k  1/. In both cases the probability is the same, and it equals n ij =.k  j C 1/ since j D 2. More generally, o ij old requests occur before the j th old request. Each of these prior old requests either caused an eviction or did not. For those that caused an eviction, it is because they were evicted by a previous request, and for those that did not cause an eviction, it is because they were not evicted by any previous request. In either case, we can decrease the number of blocks that the random process is choosing from by 1 for each old request, and thus o ij requests cannot cause b ij to be evicted. Therefore, we can use Lemma 27.6 to determine the probability that b ij was evicted by a previous request, with x D k  o ij , y D o ij and m D n ij . Thus, we have proven our claim that the probability of a cache miss on the j th request for an old block is n ij =.k  o ij /, or n ij =.k  j C 1/. Since n ij හ r i (recall that r i is the number of new requests during epoch i ), we have an upper bound of r i =.k  j C 1/ on the probability that the j th old request incurs a cache miss. We can now compute the expected number of misses during epoch i using indi- cator random variables, as introduced in Section 5.2. We deûne indicator random variables Y ij D I fthe j th old request in epoch i incurs a cache missg ; Z ij D I fthe j th new request in epoch i incurs a cache missg : We have Z ij D 1 for j D 1; 2; : : : ; r i , since every new request results in a cache miss.

Then, we have X D P p i D1 X i , so that E ŒX � D E \" p X i D1 X i # D p X i D1 E ŒX i � (by linearity of expectation) හ p X i D1 r i H k (by inequality (27.16)) D H k p X i D1 r i : (27.17) To complete the analysis, we need to understand the behavior of the optimal of- üine algorithm. It could make a completely different set of decisions from those made by RANDOMIZED-MARKING, and at any point its cache may look nothing like the cache of the randomized algorithm. Yet, we want to relate the number of cache misses of the optimal ofüine algorithm to the value in inequality (27.17), in order to have a competitive ratio that does not depend on P p i D1 r i . Focusing on individual epochs won’t sufûce. At the beginning of any epoch, the ofüine algo- rithm might have loaded the cache with exactly the blocks that will be requested in that epoch. Therefore, we cannot take any one epoch in isolation and claim that an ofüine algorithm must suffer any cache misses during that epoch. If we consider two consecutive epochs, however, we can better analyze the opti- mal ofüine algorithm. Consider two consecutive epochs, i  1 and i . Each contains k requests for k different blocks. (Recall our assumption that all requests are ûrst requests in an epoch.) Epoch i contains r i requests for new blocks, that is, blocks that were not requested during epoch i  1. Therefore, the number of distinct re- quests during epochs i 1 and i is exactly k Cr i . No matter what the cache contents were at the beginning of epoch i  1, after k C r i distinct requests, there must be at least r i cache misses. There could be more, but there is no way to have fewer. Let- ting m i denote the number of cache misses of the ofüine algorithm during epoch i , we have just argued that i 1 C m i  r i : (27.18) 814 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms The total number of cache misses of the ofüine algorithm is p X i D1 m i D 1 2 p X i D1 2m i D 1 2  m 1 C p X i D2 .m i 1 C m i / C m p !  1 2  m 1 C p X i D2 .m i 1 C m i / !  1 2  m 1 C p X i D2 r i !

Problems 27-1 Cow-path problem The Appalachian Trail (AT) is a marked hiking trail in the eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about 2,190 miles long. You decide that you are going to hike the AT from Georgia to Maine and back. You plan to learn more about algorithms while on the trail, and so you bring along your copy of Introduction to Algorithms in your backpack. 2 You have already read through this chapter before starting out. Because the beauty of the trail distracts you, you forget about reading this book until you have reached Maine and hiked halfway back to Georgia. At that point, you decide that you have already seen the trail and want to continue reading the rest of the book, starting with Chapter 28. Unfortunately, you ûnd that the book is no longer in your pack. You must have left it somewhere along the trail, but you don’t know where. It could be anywhere between Georgia and Maine. You want to ûnd the book, but now that you have learned something about online algorithms, you want your algorithm for ûnding it to have a good competitive ratio. That is, no matter where the book is, if its distance from you is x miles away, you would like to be sure that you do not walk more than cx miles to ûnd it, for some constant c . You do not know x , though you may assume that x  1. 3 2 This book is heavy.

Your algorithm should work for a trail of any length, not just the 2,190-mile-long AT. 27-2 Online scheduling to minimize average completion time Problem 15-2 discusses scheduling to minimize average completion time on one machine, without release times and preemption and with release times and preemp- tion. Now you will develop an online algorithm for nonpreemptively scheduling a set of tasks with release times. Suppose you are given a set S D fa 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n g of tasks, where task a i has release time r i , before which it cannot start, and requires p i units of processing time to complete once it has started. You have one computer on which to run the tasks. Tasks cannot be preempted, which is to say that once started, a task must run to completion without interruption. (See Problem 15-2 on page 446 for a more detailed description of this problem.) Given a schedule, let C i be the completion time of task a i , that is, the time at which task a i completes processing. Your goal is to ûnd a schedule that minimizes the average completion time, that is, to minimize .1=n/ P n i D1 C i : In the online version of this problem, you learn about task i only when it arrives at its release time r i , and at that point, you know its processing time p i . The ofüine version of this problem is NP-hard (see Chapter 34), but you will develop a 2-competitive online algorithm. a. Show that, if there are release times, scheduling by shortest processing time (when the machine becomes idle, start the already released task with the small- est processing time that has not yet run) is not d -competitive for any constant d . In order to develop an online algorithm, consider the preemptive version of this problem, which is discussed in Problem 15-2(b). One way to schedule is to run the tasks according to the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) order. That is, at any point, the machine is running the available task with the smallest amount of remaining processing time. b. Explain how to run SRPT as an online algorithm. c.

Combine parts (c)–(f) to show that the online version of C OMPLETION-TIME- SCHEDULE is 2-competitive. Chapter notes Online algorithms are widely used in many domains. Some good overviews include the textbook by Borodin and El-Yaniv [68], the collection of surveys edited by Fiat and Woeginger [142], and the survey by Albers [14]. The move-to-front heuristic from Section 27.2 was analyzed by Sleator and Tar- jan [416, 417] as part of their early work on amortized analysis. This rule works quite well in practice. Competitive analysis of online caching also originated with Sleator and Tarjan [417]. The randomized marking algorithm was proposed and analyzed by Fiat et al. [141]. Young [464] surveys online caching and paging algorithms, and Buchbinder and Naor [76] survey primal-dual online algorithms. Speciûc types of online algorithms are described using other names. Dynamic graph algorithms are online algorithms on graphs, where at each step a vertex or edge undergoes modiûcation. Typically a vertex or edge is either inserted or 818 Chapter 27 Online Algorithms deleted, or some associated property, such as edge weight, changes. Some graph problems need to be solved again after each change to the graph, and a good dy- namic graph algorithm will not need to solve from scratch. For example, edges are inserted and deleted, and after each change to the graph, the minimum spanning tree is recomputed. Exercise 21.2-8 asks such a question. Similar questions can be asked for other graph algorithms, such as shortest paths, connectivity, or matching. The ûrst paper in this ûeld is credited to Even and Shiloach [138], who study how to maintain a shortest-path tree as edges are being deleted from a graph. Since then hundreds of papers have been published. Demetrescu et al. [110] survey early developments in dynamic graph algorithms. For massive data sets, the input data might be too large to store. Streaming al- gorithms model this situation by requiring the memory used by an algorithm to be signiûcantly smaller than the input size. For example, you may have a graph with n vertices and m edges with m  n, but the memory allowed may be only O.n/. Or you may have n numbers, but the memory allowed may only be O.lg n/ or O. p n/. A streaming algorithm is measured by the number of passes made over the data in addition to the running time of the algorithm. McGregor [322] surveys streaming algorithms for graphs and Muthukrishnan [341] surveys general streaming algo- rithms. 28 Matrix Operations Because operations on matrices lie at the heart of scientiûc computing, efûcient al- gorithms for working with matrices have many practical applications. This chapter focuses on how to multiply matrices and solve sets of simultaneous linear equa- tions. Appendix D reviews the basics of matrices. Section 28.1 shows how to solve a set of linear equations using LUP decom- positions. Then, Section 28.2 explores the close relationship between multiplying and inverting matrices. Finally, Section 28.3 discusses the important class of sym- metric positive-deûnite matrices and shows how to use them to ûnd a least-squares solution to an overdetermined set of linear equations. One important issue that arises in practice is numerical stability. Because actual computers have limits to how precisely they can represent üoating-point numbers, round-off errors in numerical computations may become ampliûed over the course of a computation, leading to incorrect results. Such computations are called nu- merically unstable. Although we’ll brieüy consider numerical stability on occa- sion, we won’t focus on it in this chapter. We refer you to the excellent book by Higham [216] for a thorough discussion of stability issues. 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations Numerous applications need to solve sets of simultaneous linear equations. A lin- ear system can be cast as a matrix equation in which each matrix or vector element belongs to a ûeld, typically the real numbers R. This section discusses how to solve a system of linear equations using a method called LUP decomposition. The process starts with a set of linear equations in n unknowns x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n : 820 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations a 11 x 1 C a 12 x 2 C    C a 1n x n D b 1 ; a 21 x 1 C a 22 x 2 C    C a 2n x n D b 2 ; : : : a n1 x 1 C a n2 x 2 C    C a nn x n D b n : (28.1) A solution to the equations (28.1) is a set of values for x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n that satisfy all of the equations simultaneously. In this section, we treat only the case in which there are exactly n equations in n unknowns. Next, rewrite equations (28.1) as the matrix-vector equation Û a 11 a 12    a 1n a 21 a 22    a 2n : : : : : : : : : : : : a n1 a n2    a nn Û x 1 x 2 : : : x n  D Û b 1 b 2 : : : b n  or, equivalently, letting A D .a ij /, x D .x i /, and b D .b i /, as Ax D b : (28.2) If A is nonsingular, it possesses an inverse A 1 , and x D A 1 b (28.3) is the solution vector. We can prove that x is the unique solution to equation (28.2) as follows. If there are two solutions, x and x 0 , then Ax D Ax 0 D b and, letting I denote an identity matrix, D I x D .A 1 A/x D A 1 .Ax/ D A 1 .Ax 0 / D .A 1 A/x 0 D I x 0 D x 0 : This section focuses on the case in which A is nonsingular or, equivalently (by Theorem D.1 on page 1220), the rank of A equals the number n of unknowns. There are other possibilities, however, which merit a brief discussion. If the num- ber of equations is less than the number n of unknowns4or, more generally, if the rank of A is less than n4then the system is underdetermined. An underde- termined system typically has inûnitely many solutions, although it may have no 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 821 solutions at all if the equations are inconsistent. If the number of equations ex- ceeds the number n of unknowns, the system is overdetermined, and there may not exist any solutions. Section 28.3 addresses the important problem of ûnding good approximate solutions to overdetermined systems of linear equations. Let’s return to the problem of solving the system Ax D b of n equations in n un- knowns. One option is to compute A 1 and then, using equation (28.3), multiply b by A 1 , yielding x D A 1 b. This approach suffers in practice from numerical instability. Fortunately, another approach4LUP decomposition4is numerically stable and has the further advantage of being faster in practice. Overview of LUP decomposition The idea behind LUP decomposition is to ûnd three n  n matrices L, U , and P such that PA D LU ; (28.4) where L is a unit lower-triangular matrix,  U is an upper-triangular matrix, and  P is a permutation matrix. We call matrices L, U , and P satisfying equation (28.4) an LUP decomposition of the matrix A. We’ll show that every nonsingular matrix A possesses such a decomposition. Computing an LUP decomposition for the matrix A has the advantage that linear systems can be efûciently solved when they are triangular, as is the case for both matrices L and U . If you have an LUP decomposition for A, you can solve equa- tion (28.2), Ax D b, by solving only triangular linear systems, as follows. Multiply both sides of Ax D b by P , yielding the equivalent equation PAx D P b. By Exer- cise D.1-4 on page 1219, multiplying both sides by a permutation matrix amounts to permuting the equations (28.1). By the decomposition (28.4), substituting LU for PA gives LUx D P b : You can now solve this equation by solving two triangular linear systems. Deûne y D Ux , where x is the desired solution vector. First, solve the lower-triangular system Ly D P b (28.5) for the unknown vector y by a method called <forward substitution.= Having solved for y , solve the upper-triangular system 822 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations Ux D y (28.6) for the unknown x by a method called <back substitution.= Why does this pro- cess solve Ax D b? Because the permutation matrix P is invertible (see Exer- cise D.2-3 on page 1223), multiplying both sides of equation (28.4) by P 1 gives P 1 PA D P 1 LU , so that A D P 1 LU : (28.7) Hence, the vector x that satisûes Ux D y is the solution to Ax D b: Ax D P 1 LUx (by equation (28.7)) D P 1 Ly (by equation (28.6)) D P 1 P b (by equation (28.5)) D b : The next step is to show how forward and back substitution work and then attack the problem of computing the LUP decomposition itself. Forward and back substitution Forward substitution can solve the lower-triangular system (28.5) in ‚.n 2 / time, given L, P , and b. An array �Œ1 W n� provides a more compact format to represent the permutation P than an n  n matrix that is mostly 0s. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, the entry �Œi � indicates that P i;Œi Ł D 1 and P ij D 0 for j ¤ �Œi �. Thus, PA has a Œi Ł;j in row i and column j , and P b has b Œi Ł as its i th element. Since L is unit lower-triangular, the matrix equation Ly D P b is equivalent to the n equations y 1 D b Œ1Ł ; l 21 y 1 C y 2 D b Œ2Ł ; l 31 y 1 C l 32 y 2 C y 3 D b Œ3Ł ; : : : l n1 y 1 C l n2 y 2 C l n3 y 3 C    C y n D b ŒnŁ : The ûrst equation gives y 1 D b Œ1Ł directly. Knowing the value of y 1 , you can substitute it into the second equation, yielding 2 D b Œ2Ł  l 21 y 1 : Next, you can substitute both y 1 and y 2 into the third equation, obtaining y 3 D b Œ3Ł  .l 31 y 1 C l 32 y 2 / : In general, you substitute y 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y i 1 <forward= into the i th equation to solve for y i : 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 823 y i D b Œi Ł  i 1 X j D1 l ij y j : Once you’ve solved for y , you can solve for x in equation (28.6) using back substitution, which is similar to forward substitution. This time, you solve the nth equation ûrst and work backward to the ûrst equation. Like forward substitution, this process runs in ‚.n 2 / time. Since U is upper-triangular, the matrix equation Ux D y is equivalent to the n equations u 11 x 1 C u 12 x 2 C    C u 1;n2 x n2 C u 1;n1 x n1 C u 1n x n D y 1 ; u 22 x 2 C    C u 2;n2 x n2 C u 2;n1 x n1 C u 2n x n D y 2 ; : : : u n2;n2 x n2 C u n2;n1 x n1 C u n2;n x n D y n2 ; u n1;n1 x n1 C u n1;n x n D y n1 ; u n;n x n D y n : Thus, you can solve for x n ; x n1 ; : : : ; x 1 successively as follows: x n D y n =u n;n ; x n1 D .y n1  u n1;n x n /=u n1;n1 ; x n2 D .y n2  .u n2;n1 x n1 C u n2;n x n //=u n2;n2 ; : : : or, in general, i D  y i  n X j Di C1 u ij x j ! =u i i : Given P , L, U , and b, the procedure LUP-SOLVE on the next page solves for x by combining forward and back substitution. The permutation matrix P is repre- sented by the array � . The procedure ûrst solves for y using forward substitution in lines 233, and then it solves for x using backward substitution in lines 435. Since the summation within each of the for loops includes an implicit loop, the running time is ‚.n 2 /. As an example of these methods, consider the system of linear equations deûned by Ax D b, where A D ã 1 2 0 3 4 4 5 6 3 ä and b D ã 3 7 8 ä ; 824 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations LUP-SOLVE.L; U; �; b; n/ 1 let x and y be new vectors of length n 2 for i D 1 to n 3 y i D b Œi Ł  P i 1 j D1 l ij y j 4 for i D n downto 1 5 x i D ã y i  P n j Di C1 u ij x j ä =u i i 6 return x and we want to solve for the unknown x .

Computing an LU decomposition Given an LUP decomposition for a nonsingular matrix A, you can use forward and back substitution to solve the system Ax D b of linear equations. Now let’s see 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 825 how to efûciently compute an LUP decomposition for A. We start with the simpler case in which A is an n  n nonsingular matrix and P is absent (or, equivalently, P D I n , the n  n identity matrix), so that A D LU . We call the two matrices L and U an LU decomposition of A. To create an LU decomposition, we’ll use a process known as Gaussian elimi- nation. Start by subtracting multiples of the ûrst equation from the other equations in order to remove the ûrst variable from those equations. Then subtract multiples of the second equation from the third and subsequent equations so that now the ûrst and second variables are removed from them. Continue this process until the sys- tem that remains has an upper-triangular form4this is the matrix U . The matrix L comprises the row multipliers that cause variables to be eliminated. To implement this strategy, let’s start with a recursive formulation. The input is an n  n nonsingular matrix A. If n D 1, then nothing needs to be done: just choose L D I 1 and U D A. For n > 1, break A into four parts: A D Û a 11 a 12    a 1n a 21 a 22    a 2n : : : : : : : : : : : : a n1 a n2    a nn  D Ï a 11 w T v A 0 Ð ; (28.8) where v D .a 21 ; a 31 ; : : : ; a n1 / is a column .n1/-vector, w T D .a 12 ; a 13 ; : : : ; a 1n / T is a row .n  1/-vector, and A 0 is an .n  1/  .n  1/ matrix. Then, using matrix algebra (verify the equations by simply multiplying through), factor A as A D Ï a 11 w T v A 0 Ð D Ï 1 0 v=a 11 I n1 ÐÏ a 11 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a 11 Ð : (28.9) The 0s in the ûrst and second matrices of equation (28.9) are row and column .n  1/-vectors, respectively. The term vw T =a 11 is an .n  1/  .n  1/ matrix formed by taking the outer product of v and w and dividing each element of the result by a 11 . Thus it conforms in size to the matrix A 0 from which it is subtracted. The resulting .n  1/  .n  1/ matrix A 0  vw T =a 11 (28.10) is called the Schur complement of A with respect to a 11 . We claim that if A is nonsingular, then the Schur complement is nonsingular, too. Why? Suppose that the Schur complement, which is .n  1/  .n  1/, is singular. Then by Theorem D.1, it has row rank strictly less than n  1. Because the bottom n  1 entries in the ûrst column of the matrix 826 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations Ï a 11 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a 11 Ð are all 0, the bottom n  1 rows of this matrix must have row rank strictly less than n  1. The row rank of the entire matrix, therefore, is strictly less than n. Applying Exercise D.2-8 on page 1223 to equation (28.9), A has rank strictly less than n, and from Theorem D.1, we derive the contradiction that A is singular. Because the Schur complement is nonsingular, it, too, has an LU decomposition, which we can ûnd recursively. Let’s say that A 0  vw T =a 11 D L 0 U 0 ; where L 0 is unit lower-triangular and U 0 is upper-triangular. The LU decomposi- tion of A is then A D LU , with L D Ï 1 0 v=a 11 L 0 Ð and U D Ï a 11 w T 0 U 0 Ð ; as shown by D Ï 1 0 v=a 11 I n1 ÐÏ a 11 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a 11 Ð (by equation (28.9)) D Ï 1 0 v=a 11 I n1 ÐÏ a 11 w T 0 L 0 U 0 Ð D Ï a 11 w T v vw T =a 11 C L 0 U 0 Ð D Ï 1 0 v=a 11 L 0 ÐÏ a 11 w T 0 U 0 Ð D LU : Because L 0 is unit lower-triangular, so is L, and because U 0 is upper-triangular, so is U . Of course, if a 11 D 0, this method doesn’t work, because it divides by 0. It also doesn’t work if the upper leftmost entry of the Schur complement A 0  vw T =a 11 is 0, since the next step of the recursion will divide by it. The denominators in each step of LU decomposition are called pivots, and they occupy the diagonal elements of the matrix U . The permutation matrix P included in LUP decomposition pro- vides a way to avoid dividing by 0, as we’ll see below. Using permutations to avoid division by 0 (or by small numbers, which can contribute to numerical instability), is called pivoting. An important class of matrices for which LU decomposition always works cor- rectly is the class of symmetric positive-deûnite matrices. Such matrices require no pivoting to avoid dividing by 0 in the recursive strategy outlined above. We will prove this result, as well as several others, in Section 28.3. 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 827 The pseudocode in the procedure LU-DECOMPOSITION follows the recursive strategy, except that an iteration loop replaces the recursion. (This transformation is a standard optimization for a <tail-recursive= procedure4one whose last operation is a recursive call to itself. See Problem 7-5 on page 202.) The procedure initializes the matrix U with 0s below the diagonal and matrix L with 1s on its diagonal and 0s above the diagonal. Each iteration works on a square submatrix, using its upper leftmost element as the pivot to compute the v and w vectors and the Schur complement, which becomes the square submatrix worked on by the next iteration. LU-DECOMPOSITION .A; n/ 1 let L and U be new n  n matrices 2 initialize U with 0s below the diagonal 3 initialize L with 1s on the diagonal and 0s above the diagonal 4 for k D 1 to n 5 u kk D a kk 6 for i D k C 1 to n 7 l i k D a i k =a kk // a i k holds v i 8 u ki D a ki // a ki holds w i 9 for i D k C 1 to n // compute the Schur complement . . . 10 for j D k C 1 to n 11 a ij D a ij  l i k u kj // . . . and store it back into A 12 return L and U Each recursive step in the description above takes place in one iteration of the outer for loop of lines 4311. Within this loop, line 5 determines the pivot to be u kk D a kk . The for loop in lines 638 (which does not execute when k D n) uses the v and w vectors to update L and U . Line 7 determines the below-diagonal elements of L, storing v i =a kk in l i k , and line 8 computes the above-diagonal el- ements of U , storing w i in u ki . Finally, lines 9311 compute the elements of the Schur complement and store them back into the matrix A. (There is no need to divide by a kk in line 11 because that already happened when line 7 computed l i k .) Because line 11 is triply nested, LU-DECOMPOSITION runs in ‚.n 3 / time. Figure 28.1 illustrates the operation of LU-DECOMPOSITION. It shows a stan- dard optimization of the procedure that stores the signiûcant elements of L and U in place in the matrix A. Each element a ij corresponds to either l ij (if i > j ) or u ij (if i හ j ), so that the matrix A holds both L and U when the procedure terminates. To obtain the pseudocode for this optimization from the pseudocode for the LU-DECOMPOSITION procedure, just replace each reference to l or u by a. You can verify that this transformation preserves correctness. 828 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations 2 4 1 2 3 1 5 6 13 5 19 2 19 10 23 4 10 11 31 (a) 3 1 5 3 4 2 4 1 16 9 18 2 4 9 21 (b) 2 3 1 5 3 2 4 1 4 1 2 2 1 7 17 (c) 2 3 1 5 3 4 2 4 1 4 2 2 1 7 3 (d) (e)  2 3 1 5 6 13 5 19 2 19 10 23 4 10 11 31 Ú D  1 0 0 0 3 1 0 0 1 4 1 0 2 1 7 1 Ú  2 3 1 5 0 4 2 4 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 3 Ú A L U Figure 28.1 The operation of LU-D ECOMPOSITION.

(d) After the next iteration, the matrix A is factored. The element 3 in the new Schur complement becomes part of U when the recursion terminates.) (e) The factorization A D LU . Computing an LUP decomposition If the diagonal of the matrix given to LU-DECOMPOSITION contains any 0s, then the procedure will attempt to divide by 0, which would cause disaster. Even if the diagonal contains no 0s, but does have numbers with small absolute values, dividing by such numbers can cause numerical instabilities. Therefore, LUP de- composition pivots on entries with the largest absolute values that it can ûnd. In LUP decomposition, the input is an n  n nonsingular matrix A, with a goal of ûnding a permutation matrix P , a unit lower-triangular matrix L, and an upper- triangular matrix U such that PA D LU . Before partitioning the matrix A, as LU decomposition does, LUP decomposition moves a nonzero element, say a k1 , from somewhere in the ûrst column to the .1; 1/ position of the matrix. For the greatest numerical stability, LUP decomposition chooses the element in the ûrst column with the greatest absolute value as a k1 . (The ûrst column cannot contain only 0s, for then A would be singular, because its determinant would be 0, by Theorems D.4 and D.5 on page 1221.) In order to preserve the set of equations, LUP decom- position exchanges row 1 with row k, which is equivalent to multiplying A by a 28.1 Solving systems of linear equations 829 permutation matrix Q on the left (Exercise D.1-4 on page 1219). Thus, the analog to equation (28.8) expresses QA as QA D Ï a k1 w T v A 0 Ð ; where v D .a 21 ; a 31 ; : : : ; a n1 /, except that a 11 replaces a k1 ; w T D .a k2 ; a k3 ; : : : ; a kn / T ; and A 0 is an .n  1/  .n  1/ matrix. Since a k1 ¤ 0, the analog to equation (28.9) guarantees no division by 0: QA D Ï a k1 w T v A 0 Ð D Ï 1 0 v=a k1 I n1 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a k1 Ð : Just as in LU decomposition, if A is nonsingular, then the Schur complement A 0  vw T =a k1 is nonsingular, too. Therefore, you can recursively ûnd an LUP decomposition for it, with unit lower-triangular matrix L 0 , upper-triangular ma- trix U 0 , and permutation matrix P 0 , such that P 0 .A 0  vw T =a k1 / D L 0 U 0 : Deûne P D Ï 1 0 0 P 0 Ð Q ; which is a permutation matrix, since it is the product of two permutation matrices (Exercise D.1-4 on page 1219). This deûnition of P gives PA D Ï 1 0 0 P 0 Ð QA D Ï 1 0 0 P 0 ÐÏ 1 0 v=a k1 I n1 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a k1 Ð D Ï 1 0 P 0 v=a k1 P 0 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 A 0  vw T =a k1 Ð D Ï 1 0 P 0 v=a k1 I n1 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 P 0 .A 0  vw T =a k1 / Ð D Ï 1 0 P 0 v=a k1 I n1 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 L 0 U 0 Ð D Ï 1 0 P 0 v=a k1 L 0 ÐÏ a k1 w T 0 U 0 Ð D LU ; 830 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations which yields the LUP decomposition. Because L 0 is unit lower-triangular, so is L, and because U 0 is upper-triangular, so is U . Notice that in this derivation, unlike the one for LU decomposition, both the column vector v=a k1 and the Schur complement A 0  vw T =a k1 are multiplied by the permutation matrix P 0 . The procedure LUP- DECOMPOSITION gives the pseu- docode for LUP decomposition.

As an improvement over a direct implementation of the recursion, the procedure dynamically maintains the permutation matrix P as an array � , where �Œi � D j means that the i th row of P contains a 1 in col- umn j . The LUP-DECOMPOSITION procedure also implements the improvement mentioned earlier, computing L and U in place in the matrix A. Thus, when the procedure terminates, ij D ( l ij if i > j ; u ij if i හ j : Figure 28.2 illustrates how LUP-DECOMPOSITION factors a matrix. Lines 233 initialize the array � to represent the identity permutation.

If all elements in the current ûrst column are 0, lines 10311 report that the matrix is singular. To pivot, line 12 exchanges �Œk 0 � with �Œk�, and lines 13314 exchange the kth and k 0 th rows of A, thereby making the pivot element a kk . (The entire rows are swapped because in the derivation of the method above, not only is A 0  vw T =a k1 multiplied by P 0 , but so is v=a k1 .) Finally, the Schur complement is computed by lines 15318 in much the same way as it is computed by lines 6311 of LU-DECOMPOSITION, except that here the operation is written to work in place. Because of its triply nested loop structure, LUP-DECOMPOSITION has a run- ning time of ‚.n 3 /, which is the same as that of LU-DECOMPOSITION. Thus, pivoting costs at most a constant factor in time.

How about in LUP-DECOMPOSITION? 28.2 Inverting matrices Although you can use equation (28.3) to solve a system of linear equations by com- puting a matrix inverse, in practice you are better off using more numerically stable techniques, such as LUP decomposition. Sometimes, however, you really do need to compute a matrix inverse. This section shows how to use LUP decomposition to compute a matrix inverse. It also proves that matrix multiplication and computing the inverse of a matrix are equivalently hard problems, in that (subject to techni- cal conditions) an algorithm for one can solve the other in the same asymptotic running time. Thus, you can use Strassen’s algorithm (see Section 4.2) for matrix multiplication to invert a matrix. Indeed, Strassen’s original paper was motivated by the idea that a set of a linear equations could be solved more quickly than by the usual method. Computing a matrix inverse from an LUP decomposition Suppose that you have an LUP decomposition of a matrix A in the form of three matrices L, U , and P such that PA D LU . Using LUP-SOLVE, you can solve an equation of the form Ax D b in ‚.n 2 / time. Since the LUP decomposition de- pends on A but not b, you can run LUP-SOLVE on a second set of equations of the form Ax D b 0 in ‚.n 2 / additional time. In general, once you have the LUP decom- position of A, you can solve, in ‚.k n 2 / time, k versions of the equation Ax D b that differ only in the vector b. Let’s think of the equation AX D I n ; (28.11) which deûnes the matrix X , the inverse of A, as a set of n distinct equations of the form Ax D b. To be precise, let X i denote the i th column of X , and recall that the 834 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations unit vector e i is the i th column of I n . You can then solve equation (28.11) for X by using the LUP decomposition for A to solve each equation AX i D e i separately for X i . Once you have the LUP decomposition, you can compute each of the n columns X i in ‚.n 2 / time, and so you can compute X from the LUP decomposition of A in ‚.n 3 / time. Since you ûnd the LUP decomposition of A in ‚.n 3 / time, you can compute the inverse A 1 of a matrix A in ‚.n 3 / time. Matrix multiplication and matrix inversion Now let’s see how the theoretical speedups obtained for matrix multiplication trans- late to speedups for matrix inversion. In fact, we’ll prove something stronger: ma- trix inversion is equivalent to matrix multiplication, in the following sense. If M.n/ denotes the time to multiply two n  n matrices, then a nonsingular n  n matrix can be inverted in O.M.n// time. Moreover, if I.n/ denotes the time to invert a nonsingular n  n matrix, then two n  n matrices can be multiplied in O.I.n// time. We prove these results as two separate theorems. Theorem 28.1 (Multiplication is no harder than inversion) If an n  n matrix can be inverted in I.n/ time, where I.n/ D �.n 2 / and I.n/ satisûes the regularity condition I.3n/ D O.I.n//, then two n  n matrices can be multiplied in O.I.n// time. Proof Let A and B be n  n matrices. To compute their product C D AB , deûne the 3n  3n matrix D by D D ã I n A 0 0 I n B 0 0 I n ä : The inverse of D is D 1 D ã I n A AB 0 I n B 0 0 I n ä ; and thus to compute the product AB , just take the upper right n  n submatrix of D 1 . Constructing matrix D takes ‚.n 2 / time, which is O.I.n// from the assumption that I.n/ D �.n 2 /, and inverting D takes O.I.3n// D O.I.n// time, by the regularity condition on I.n/. We thus have M.n/ D O.I.n//. Note that I.n/ satisûes the regularity condition whenever I.n/ D ‚.n c lg d n/ for any constants c > 0 and d  0. 28.2 Inverting matrices 835 The proof that matrix inversion is no harder than matrix multiplication relies on some properties of symmetric positive-deûnite matrices proved in Section 28.3. Theorem 28.2 (Inversion is no harder than multiplication) Suppose that two n  n real matrices can be multiplied in M.n/ time, where M.n/ D �.n 2 / and M.n/ satisûes the following two regularity conditions: 1. M.n C k/ D O.M.n// for any k in the range 0 හ k < n, and 2. M.n=2/ හ cM.n/ for some constant c < 1=2. Then the inverse of any real nonsingular n  n matrix can be computed in O.M.n// time. Proof Let A be an n  n matrix with real-valued entries that is nonsingular. As- sume that n is an exact power of 2 (i.e., n D 2 l for some integer l ); we’ll see at the end of the proof what to do if n is not an exact power of 2. For the moment, assume that the n  n matrix A is symmetric and positive- deûnite. Partition each of A and its inverse A 1 into four n=2  n=2 submatrices: A D Ï B C T C D Ð and A 1 D Ï R T U V Ð : (28.12) Then, if we let D D  CB 1 C T (28.13) be the Schur complement of A with respect to B (we’ll see more about this form of Schur complement in Section 28.3), we have A 1 D Ï R T U V Ð D Ï B 1 C B 1 C T S 1 CB 1 B 1 C T S 1 S 1 CB 1 S 1 Ð ; (28.14) since AA 1 D I n , as you can verify by performing the matrix multiplication. Be- cause A is symmetric and positive-deûnite, Lemmas 28.4 and 28.5 in Section 28.3 imply that B and S are both symmetric and positive-deûnite. By Lemma 28.3 in Section 28.3, therefore, the inverses B 1 and S 1 exist, and by Exercise D.2-6 on page 1223, B 1 and S 1 are symmetric, so that .B 1 / T D B 1 and .S 1 / T D S 1 . Therefore, to compute the submatrices R D B 1 C B 1 C T S 1 CB 1 ; T D B 1 C T S 1 ; U D S 1 CB 1 ; and V D S 1 of A 1 , do the following, where all matrices mentioned are n=2  n=2: 836 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations 1. Form the submatrices B , C , C T , and D of A. 2. Recursively compute the inverse B 1 of B . 3. Compute the matrix product W D CB 1 , and then compute its transpose W T , which equals B 1 C T (by Exercise D.1-2 on page 1219 and .B 1 / T D B 1 ). 4. Compute the matrix product X D W C T , which equals CB 1 C T , and then compute the matrix S D D  X D D  CB 1 C T . 5. Recursively compute the inverse S 1 of S . 6. Compute the matrix product Y D S 1 W , which equals S 1 CB 1 , and then compute its transpose Y T , which equals B 1 C T S 1 (by Exercise D.1-2, .B 1 / T D B 1 , and .S 1 / T D S 1 ). 7. Compute the matrix product Z D W T Y , which equals B 1 C T S 1 CB 1 . 8. Set R D B 1 C Z. 9. Set T D Y T . 10. Set U D Y . 11. Set V D S 1 . Thus, to invert an n  n symmetric positive-deûnite matrix, invert two n=2  n=2 matrices in steps 2 and 5; perform four multiplications of n=2  n=2 matrices in steps 3, 4, 6, and 7; plus incur an additional cost of O.n 2 / for extracting submatri- ces from A, inserting submatrices into A 1 , and performing a constant number of additions, subtractions, and transposes on n=2  n=2 matrices. The running time is given by the recurrence I.n/ හ 2I.n=2/ C 4M.n=2/ C O.n 2 / D 2I.n=2/ C ‚.M.n// (28.15) D O.M.n// : The second line follows from the assumption that M.n/ D �.n 2 / and from the second regularity condition in the statement of the theorem, which implies that 4M.n=2/ < 2M.n/ . Because M.n/ D �.n 2 /, case 3 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1) applies to the recurrence (28.15), giving the O.M.n// result. It remains to prove how to obtain the same asymptotic running time for ma- trix multiplication as for matrix inversion when A is invertible but not symmetric and positive-deûnite. The basic idea is that for any nonsingular matrix A, the ma- trix A T A is symmetric (by Exercise D.1-2) and positive-deûnite (by Theorem D.6 on page 1222). The trick, then, is to reduce the problem of inverting A to the problem of inverting A T A. The reduction is based on the observation that when A is an n  n nonsingular matrix, we have 28.2 Inverting matrices 837 A 1 D .A T A/ 1 A T ; since ..A T A/ 1 A T /A D .A T A/ 1 .A T A/ D I n and a matrix inverse is unique. Therefore, to compute A 1 , ûrst multiply A T by A to obtain A T A, then invert the symmetric positive-deûnite matrix A T A using the above divide-and-conquer al- gorithm, and ûnally multiply the result by A T . Each of these three steps takes O.M.n// time, and thus any nonsingular matrix with real entries can be inverted in O.M.n// time. The above proof assumed that A is an n  n matrix, where n is an exact power of 2. If n is not an exact power of 2, then let k < n be such that n C k is an exact power of 2, and deûne the .n C k/  .n C k/ matrix A 0 as A 0 D Ï A 0 0 I k Ð : Then the inverse of A 0 is Ï A 0 0 I k Ð 1 D Ï A 1 0 0 I k Ð ; Apply the method of the proof to A 0 to compute the inverse of A 0 , and take the ûrst n rows and n columns of the result as the desired answer A 1 . The ûrst regular- ity condition on M.n/ ensures that enlarging the matrix in this way increases the running time by at most a constant factor. The proof of Theorem 28.2 suggests how to solve the equation Ax D b by using LU decomposition without pivoting, so long as A is nonsingular. Let y D A T b. Multiply both sides of the equation Ax D b by A T , yielding .A T A/x D A T b D y . This transformation doesn’t affect the solution x , since A T is invertible. Because A T A is symmetric positive-deûnite, it can be factored by computing an LU de- composition. Then, use forward and back substitution to solve for x in the equa- tion .A T A/x D y . Although this method is theoretically correct, in practice the procedure LUP-DECOMPOSITION works much better. LUP decomposition re- quires fewer arithmetic operations by a constant factor, and it has somewhat better numerical properties. Exercises 28.2-1 Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n  n matrices, and let S.n/ denote the time required to square an n  n matrix. Show that multiplying and squaring matri- ces have essentially the same difûculty: an M.n/-time matrix-multiplication al- gorithm implies an O.M.n//-time squaring algorithm, and an S.n/-time squaring algorithm implies an O.S.n//-time matrix-multiplication algorithm. 838 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations 28.2-2 Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n  n matrices. Show that an M.n/-time matrix-multiplication algorithm implies an O.M.n//-time LUP-decomposition al- gorithm. (The LUP decomposition your method produces need not be the same as the result produced by the LUP-DECOMPOSITION procedure.) 28.2-3 Let M.n/ be the time to multiply two n  n boolean matrices, and let T .n/ be the time to ûnd the transitive closure of an n  n boolean matrix. (See Section 23.2.) Show that an M.n/-time boolean matrix-multiplication algorithm implies an O.M.n/ lg n/-time transitive-closure algorithm, and a T .n/-time transitive-closure algorithm implies an O.T .n//-time boolean matrix-multiplication algorithm. 28.2-4 Does the matrix-inversion algorithm based on Theorem 28.2 work when matrix elements are drawn from the ûeld of integers modulo 2? Explain. ? 28.2-5 Generalize the matrix-inversion algorithm of Theorem 28.2 to handle matrices of complex numbers, and prove that your generalization works correctly. (Hint: In- stead of the transpose of A, use the conjugate transpose A  , which you obtain from the transpose of A by replacing every entry with its complex conjugate. In- stead of symmetric matrices, consider Hermitian matrices, which are matrices A such that A D A  .) 28.3 Symmetric positive-deûnite matrices and least-squares approximation Symmetric positive-deûnite matrices have many interesting and desirable proper- ties. An n  n matrix A is symmetric positive-deûnite if A D A T (A is symmetric) and x T Ax > 0 for all n-vectors x ¤ 0 (A is positive-deûnite). Symmetric positive- deûnite matrices are nonsingular, and an LU decomposition on them will not divide by 0. This section proves these and several other important properties of symmetric positive-deûnite matrices. We’ll also see an interesting application to curve ûtting by a least-squares approximation. The ûrst property we prove is perhaps the most basic. Lemma 28.3 Any positive-deûnite matrix is nonsingular. 28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation 839 Proof Suppose that a matrix A is singular. Then by Corollary D.3 on page 1221, there exists a nonzero vector x such that Ax D 0. Hence, x T Ax D 0, and A cannot be positive-deûnite. The proof that an LU decomposition on a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix A won’t divide by 0 is more involved. We begin by proving properties about certain submatrices of A. Deûne the kth leading submatrix of A to be the matrix A k consisting of the intersection of the ûrst k rows and ûrst k columns of A. Lemma 28.4 If A is a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix, then every leading submatrix of A is symmetric and positive-deûnite. Proof Since A is symmetric, each leading submatrix A k is also symmetric. We’ll prove that A k is positive-deûnite by contradiction. If A k is not positive-deûnite, then there exists a k-vector x k ¤ 0 such that x T k A k x k හ 0. Let A be n  n, and A D Ï A k B T B C Ð (28.16) for submatrices B (which is .n  k/  k) and C (which is .n  k/  .n  k/). Deûne the n-vector x D . x T k 0 / T , where n  k 0s follow x k . Then we have x T Ax D . x T k 0 / Ï A k B T B C ÐÏ x k 0 Ð D . x T k 0 / Ï A k x k Bx k Ð D x T k A k x k හ 0 ; which contradicts A being positive-deûnite. We now turn to some essential properties of the Schur complement. Let A be a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix, and let A k be a leading k  k submatrix of A. Partition A once again according to equation (28.16). Equation (28.10) generalizes to deûne the Schur complement S of A with respect to A k as S D C  BA 1 k B T : (28.17) (By Lemma 28.4, A k is symmetric and positive-deûnite, and therefore, A 1 k exists by Lemma 28.3, and S is well deûned.) The earlier deûnition (28.10) of the Schur complement is consistent with equation (28.17) by letting k D 1. The next lemma shows that the Schur-complement matrices of symmetric posi- tive-deûnite matrices are themselves symmetric and positive-deûnite. We used this 840 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations result in Theorem 28.2, and its corollary will help prove that LU decomposition works for symmetric positive-deûnite matrices. Lemma 28.5 (Schur complement lemma) If A is a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix and A k is a leading k  k submatrix of A, then the Schur complement S of A with respect to A k is symmetric and positive-deûnite. Proof Because A is symmetric, so is the submatrix C . By Exercise D.2-6 on page 1223, the product BA 1 k B T is symmetric. Since C and BA 1 k B T are symmet- ric, then by Exercise D.1-1 on page 1219, so is S . It remains to show that S is positive-deûnite. Consider the partition of A given in equation (28.16). For any nonzero vector x , we have x T Ax > 0 by the assumption that A is positive-deûnite. Let the subvectors y and ´ consist of the ûrst k and last n  k elements in x , respectively, and thus they are compatible with A k and C , respectively. Because A 1 k exists, we have x T Ax D . y T ´ T / Ï A k B T B C ÐÏ y ´ Ð D . y T ´ T / Ï A k y C B T ´ By C C ´ Ð D y T A k y C y T B T ´ C ´ T By C ´ T C ´ D .y C A 1 k B T ´/ T A k .y C A 1 k B T ´/ C ´ T .C  BA 1 k B T /´ ; (28.18) This last equation, which you can verify by multiplying through, amounts to <com- pleting the square= of the quadratic form. (See Exercise 28.3-2.) Since x T Ax > 0 holds for any nonzero x , pick any nonzero ´ and then choose y D A 1 k B T ´, which causes the ûrst term in equation (28.18) to vanish, leaving ´ T .C  BA 1 k B T /´ D ´ T S´ as the value of the expression. For any ´ ¤ 0, we therefore have ´ T S´ D x T Ax > 0, and thus S is positive-deûnite. Corollary 28.6 LU decomposition of a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix never causes a division by 0. Proof Let A be an n  n symmetric positive-deûnite matrix. In fact, we’ll prove a stronger result than the statement of the corollary: every pivot is strictly positive. The ûrst pivot is a 11 . Let e 1 be the length-n unit vector . 1 0 0    0 / T , so that a 11 D e T 1 Ae 1 , which is positive because e 1 is nonzero and A is positive 28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation 841 deûnite. Since the ûrst step of LU decomposition produces the Schur complement of A with respect to A 1 D .a 11 /, Lemma 28.5 implies by induction that all pivots are positive. Least-squares approximation One important application of symmetric positive-deûnite matrices arises in ûtting curves to given sets of data points. You are given a set of m data points .x 1 ; y 1 /; .x 2 ; y 2 /; : : : ; .x m ; y m / ; where you know that the y i are subject to measurement errors. You wish to deter- mine a function F .x/ such that the approximation errors ශ i D F .x i /  y i (28.19) are small for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m. The form of the function F depends on the problem at hand. Let’s assume that it has the form of a linearly weighted sum F .x/ D n X j D1 c j f j .x/ ; where the number n of summands and the speciûc basis functions f j are chosen based on knowledge of the problem at hand. A common choice is f j .x/ D x j 1 , which means that F .x/ D c 1 C c 2 x C c 3 x 2 C    C c n x n1 is a polynomial of degree n  1 in x . Thus, if you are given m data points .x 1 ; y 1 /; .x 2 ; y 2 /; : : : ; .x m ; y m /, you need to calculate n coefûcients c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c n that minimize the approximation errors ශ 1 ; ශ ; : : : ; ශ m . By choosing n D m, you can calculate each y i exactly in equation (28.19). Such a high-degree polynomial F <ûts the noise= as well as the data, however, and generally gives poor results when used to predict y for previously unseen values of x . It is usually better to choose n signiûcantly smaller than m and hope that by choosing the coefûcients c j well, you can obtain a function F that ûnds the signiûcant patterns in the data points without paying undue attention to the noise. Some theoretical principles exist for choosing n, but they are beyond the scope of this text. In any case, once you choose a value of n that is less than m, you end up with an overdetermined set of equations whose solution you wish to approximate. Let’s see how to do so. 842 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations Let A D Û f 1 .x 1 / f 2 .x 1 / : : : f n .x 1 / f 1 .x 2 / f 2 .x 2 / : : : f n .x 2 / : : : : : : : : : : : : f 1 .x m / f 2 .x m / : : : f n .x m /  denote the matrix of values of the basis functions at the given points, that is, a ij D f j .x i /.

Then, Ac D Û f 1 .x 1 / f 2 .x 1 / : : : f n .x 1 / f 1 .x 2 / f 2 .x 2 / : : : f n .x 2 / : : : : : : : : : : : : f 1 .x m / f 2 .x m / : : : f n .x m / Û c 1 c 2 : : : c n  D Û F .x 1 / F .x 2 / : : : F .x m /  is the m-vector of <predicted values= for y . Thus, ශ D Ac  y is the m-vector of approximation errors. To minimize approximation errors, let’s minimize the norm of the error vector ශ, which gives a least-squares solution, since kශk D  m X i D1 ශ 2 i ! 1=2 : Because ශk 2 D kAc  y k 2 D m X i D1  n X j D1 a ij c j  y i ! 2 ; to minimize kශk, differentiate kශk 2 with respect to each c k and then set the result to 0: d kශk 2 dc k D m X i D1 2  n X j D1 a ij c j  y i ! a i k D 0 : (28.20) The n equations (28.20) for k D 1; 2; : : : ; n are equivalent to the single matrix equation 28.3 Symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices and least-squares approximation 843 .Ac  y/ T A D 0 or, equivalently (using Exercise D.1-2 on page 1219), to A T .Ac  y/ D 0 ; which implies T Ac D A T y : (28.21) In statistics, equation (28.21) is called the normal equation. The matrix A T A is symmetric by Exercise D.1-2, and if A has full column rank, then by Theorem D.6 on page 1222, A T A is positive-deûnite as well. Hence, .A T A/ 1 exists, and the solution to equation (28.21) is c D ã .A T A/ 1 A T ä y D A C y ; (28.22) where the matrix A C D ..A T A/ 1 A T / is the pseudoinverse of the matrix A. The pseudoinverse naturally generalizes the notion of a matrix inverse to the case in which A is not square. (Compare equation (28.22) as the approximate solution to Ac D y with the solution A 1 b as the exact solution to Ax D b.) As an example of producing a least-squares ût, suppose that you have ûve data points .x 1 ; y 1 / D .1; 2/ ; .x 2 ; y 2 / D .1; 1/ ; .x 3 ; y 3 / D .2; 1/ ; .x 4 ; y 4 / D .3; 0/ ; .x 5 ; y 5 / D .5; 3/ ; shown as orange dots in Figure 28.3, and you want to ût these points with a qua- dratic polynomial F .x/ D c 1 C c 2 x C c 3 x 2 : Start with the matrix of basis-function values A D â 1 x 1 x 2 1 1 x 2 x 2 2 1 x 3 x 2 3 1 x 4 x 2 4 1 x 5 x 2 5 ã D â 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 1 3 9 1 5 25 ã ; whose pseudoinverse is 844 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 0.0 1 2 3 4 5 0 31 –2 x y F(x) = 1.2 3 0.757x + 0.214x 2 Figure 28.3 The least-squares ût of a quadratic polynomial to the set of ûve data points f.1; 2/; .1; 1/; .2; 1/; .3; 0/; .5; 3/g.

As a practical matter, you would typically solve the normal equation (28.21) by multiplying y by A T and then ûnding an LU decomposition of A T A. If A has full rank, the matrix A T A is guaranteed to be nonsingular, because it is symmetric and positive-deûnite.

Linear and quadratic terms model the annual increase, and sine and cosine terms model seasonal variations. 1 The year in which Introduction to Algorithms was ûrst published. 846 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations Exercises 28.3-1 Prove that every diagonal element of a symmetric positive-deûnite matrix is posi- tive. 28.3-2 Let A D Ï a b b c Ð be a 2  2 symmetric positive-deûnite matrix.

You are given a set f.x i ; y i / W i D 0; 1; : : : ; ng of n C 1 point-value pairs, where x 0 < x 1 <    < x n . Your goal is to ût a piecewise-cubic curve (spline) f .x/ to the points. That is, the curve f .x/ is made up of n cubic polyno- mials f i .x/ D a i C b i x C c i x 2 C d i x 3 for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, where if x falls in the range x i හ x හ x i C1 , then the value of the curve is given by f .x/ D f i .x  x i /. The points x i at which the cubic polynomials are <pasted= together are called knots. For simplicity, assume that x i D i for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n. To ensure continuity of f .x/, require that f .x i / D f i .0/ D y i ; f .x i C1 / D f i .1/ D y i C1 for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. To ensure that f .x/ is sufûciently smooth, also require the ûrst derivative to be continuous at each knot: 848 Chapter 28 Matrix Operations f 0 .x i C1 / D f 0 i .1/ D f 0 i C1 .0/ for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  2. a. Suppose that for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n, in addition to the point-value pairs f.x i ; y i /g, you are also given the ûrst derivative D i D f 0 .x i / at each knot. Express each coefûcient a i , b i , c i , and d i in terms of the values y i , y i C1 , D i , and D i C1 . (Remember that x i D i .) How quickly can you compute the 4n coefûcients from the point-value pairs and ûrst derivatives? The question remains of how to choose the ûrst derivatives of f .x/ at the knots. One method is to require the second derivatives to be continuous at the knots: f 00 .x i C1 / D f 00 i .1/ D f 00 i C1 .0/ for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n2. At the ûrst and last knots, assume that f 00 .x 0 / D f 00 0 .0/ D 0 and f 00 .x n / D f 00 n1 .1/ D 0. These assumptions make f .x/ a natural cubic spline. b.

What matrix equation must your method solve, and how quickly does your algorithm run? Chapter notes Many excellent texts describe numerical and scientiûc computation in much greater detail than we have room for here. The following are especially readable: George Notes for Chapter 28 849 and Liu [180], Golub and Van Loan [192], Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flan- nery [365, 366], and Strang [422, 423]. Golub and Van Loan [192] discuss numerical stability. They show why det.A/ is not necessarily a good indicator of the stability of a matrix A, proposing instead to use kAk 1 kA 1 k 1 , where kAk 1 D max ˚P n j D1 ja ij j W 1 හ i හ n  . They also address the question of how to compute this value without actually computing A 1 . Gaussian elimination, upon which the LU and LUP decompositions are based, was the ûrst systematic method for solving linear systems of equations. It was also one of the earliest numerical algorithms. Although it was known earlier, its dis- covery is commonly attributed to C. F. Gauss (177731855). In his famous paper [424], Strassen showed that an n  n matrix can be inverted in O.n lg 7 / time. Wino- grad [460] originally proved that matrix multiplication is no harder than matrix inversion, and the converse is due to Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5]. Another important matrix decomposition is the singular value decomposition, or SVD. The SVD factors an m  n matrix A into A D Q 1 †Q T 2 , where † is an m  n matrix with nonzero values only on the diagonal, Q 1 is m  m with mutually orthonormal columns, and Q 2 is n  n, also with mutually orthonormal columns. Two vectors are orthonormal if their inner product is 0 and each vector has a norm of 1. The books by Strang [422, 423] and Golub and Van Loan [192] contain good treatments of the SVD. Strang [423] has an excellent presentation of symmetric positive-deûnite matri- ces and of linear algebra in general. 29 Linear Programming Many problems take the form of maximizing or minimizing an objective, given limited resources and competing constraints. If you can specify the objective as a linear function of certain variables, and if you can specify the constraints on resources as equalities or inequalities on those variables, then you have a linear- programming problem. Linear programs arise in a variety of practical applica- tions. We begin by studying an application in electoral politics. A political problem Suppose that you are a politician trying to win an election. Your district has three different types of areas4urban, suburban, and rural. These areas have, respec- tively, 100,000, 200,000, and 50,000 registered voters. Although not all the reg- istered voters actually go to the polls, you decide that to govern effectively, you would like at least half the registered voters in each of the three regions to vote for you. You are honorable and would never consider supporting policies you don’t believe in. You realize, however, that certain issues may be more effective in winning votes in certain places. Your primary issues are preparing for a zombie apocalypse, equipping sharks with lasers, building highways for üying cars, and allowing dolphins to vote. According to your campaign staff’s research, you can estimate how many votes you win or lose from each population segment by spending $1,000 on advertising on each issue. This information appears in the table of Figure 29.1. In this table, each entry indicates the number of thousands of either urban, suburban, or rural voters who would be won over by spending $1,000 on advertising in support of a particular issue. Negative entries denote votes that would be lost. Your task is to ûgure out the minimum amount of money that you need to spend in order to win 50,000 urban votes, 100,000 suburban votes, and 25,000 rural votes. You could, by trial and error, devise a strategy that wins the required number of votes, but the strategy you come up with might not be the least expensive one. For example, you could devote $20,000 of advertising to preparing for a zombie Chapter 29 Linear Programming 851 policy urban suburban rural zombie apocalypse 2 5 3 sharks with lasers 8 2 5 highways for üying cars 0 0 10 dolphins voting 10 0 2 Figure 29.1 The effects of policies on voters. Each entry describes the number of thousands of urban, suburban, or rural voters who could be won over by spending $1,000 on advertising support of a policy on a particular issue. Negative entries denote votes that would be lost. apocalypse, $0 to equipping sharks with lasers, $4,000 to building highways for üying cars, and $9,000 to allowing dolphins to vote. In this case, you would win .20  2/ C .0  8/ C .4  0/ C .9  10/ D 50 thousand urban votes, .20  5/ C .0  2/ C .4  0/ C .9  0/ D 100 thousand suburban votes, and .20  3/ C .0  5/ C .4  10/ C .9  2/ D 82 thousand rural votes. You would win the exact number of votes desired in the urban and suburban areas and more than enough votes in the rural area. (In fact, according to your model, in the rural area you would receive more votes than there are voters.) In order to garner these votes, you would have paid for 20 C 0 C 4 C 9 D 33 thousand dollars of advertising. It’s natural to wonder whether this strategy is the best possible. That is, can you achieve your goals while spending less on advertising? Additional trial and error might help you to answer this question, but a better approach is to formulate (or model) this question mathematically. The ûrst step is to decide what decisions you have to make and to introduce variables that capture these decisions. Since you have four decisions, you introduce four decision variables:  x 1 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on preparing for a zombie apocalypse,  x 2 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on equipping sharks with lasers,  x 3 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on building high- ways for üying cars, and  x 4 is the number of thousands of dollars spent on advertising on allowing dol- phins to vote. You then think about constraints, which are limits, or restrictions, on the values that the decision variables can take. You can write the requirement that you win at least 50,000 urban votes as 2x 1 C 8x 2 C 0x 3 C 10x 4  50 : (29.1) 852 Chapter 29 Linear Programming Similarly, you can write the requirements that you win at least 100,000 suburban votes and 25,000 rural votes as 5x 1 C 2x 2 C 0x 3 C 0x 4  100 (29.2) and 3x 1  5x 2 C 10x 3  2x 4  25 : (29.3) Any setting of the variables x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x 4 that satisûes inequalities (29.1)3(29.3) yields a strategy that wins a sufûcient number of each type of vote. Finally, you think about your objective, which is the quantity that you wish to either minimize or maximize. In order to keep costs as small as possible, you would like to minimize the amount spent on advertising. That is, you want to minimize the expression 1 C x 2 C x 3 C x 4 : (29.4) Although negative advertising often occurs in political campaigns, there is no such thing as negative-cost advertising. Consequently, you require that x 1  0; x 2  0; x 3  0; and x 4  0 : (29.5) Combining inequalities (29.1)3(29.3) and (29.5) with the objective of minimiz- ing (29.4) produces what is known as a <linear program.= We can format this problem tabularly as minimize x 1 C x 2 C x 3 C x 4 (29.6) subject to 2x 1 C 8x 2 C 0x 3 C 10x 4  50 (29.7) 5x 1 C 2x 2 C 0x 3 C 0x 4  100 (29.8) 3x 1  5x 2 C 10x 3  2x 4  25 (29.9) x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x 4  0 : (29.10) The solution to this linear program yields your optimal strategy. The remainder of this chapter covers how to formulate linear programs and is an introduction to modeling in general. Modeling refers to the general process of converting a problem into a mathematical form amenable to solution by an algo- rithm. Section 29.1 discusses brieüy the algorithmic aspects of linear program- ming, although it does not include the details of a linear-programming algorithm. Throughout this book, we have seen ways to model problems, such as by shortest paths and connectivity in a graph. When modeling a problem as a linear program, you go through the steps used in this political example4identifying the decision variables, specifying the constraints, and formulating the objective function. In or- der to model a problem as a linear program, the constraints and objectives must be 29.1 Linear programming formulations and algorithms 853 linear. In Section 29.2, we will see several other examples of modeling via linear programs. Section 29.3 discusses duality, an important concept in linear program- ming and other optimization algorithms. 29.1 Linear programming formulations and algorithms Linear programs take a particular form, which we will examine in this section. Multiple algorithms have been developed to solve linear programs. Some run in polynomial time, some do not, but they are all too complicated to show here. In- stead, we will give an example that demonstrates some ideas behind the simplex algorithm, which is currently the most commonly deployed solution method. General linear programs In the general linear-programming problem, we wish to optimize a linear function subject to a set of linear inequalities. Given a set of real numbers a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n and a set of variables x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n , we deûne a linear function f on those variables by f .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n / D a 1 x 1 C a 2 x 2 C    C a n x n D n X j D1 a j x j : If b is a real number and f is a linear function, then the equation f .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n / D b is a linear equality and the inequalities f .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n / හ b and f .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n /  b are linear inequalities. We use the general term linear constraints to denote either linear equalities or linear inequalities. Linear programming does not allow strict inequalities. Formally, a linear-programming problem is the problem of either minimizing or maximizing a linear function subject to a ûnite set of linear con- straints. If minimizing, we call the linear program a minimization linear program, and if maximizing, we call the linear program a maximization linear program. In order to discuss linear-programming algorithms and properties, it will be helpful to use a standard notation for the input. By convention, a maximiza- tion linear program takes as input n real numbers c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c n ; m real numbers b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b m ; and mn real numbers a ij for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m and j D 1; 2; : : : ; n. 854 Chapter 29 Linear Programming The goal is to ûnd n real numbers x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n that maximize n X j D1 c j x j (29.11) subject to n X j D1 a ij x j හ b i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m (29.12) x j  0 for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n : (29.13) We call expression (29.11) the objective function and the n C m inequalities in lines (29.12) and (29.13) the constraints. The n constraints in line (29.13) are the nonnegativity constraints. It can sometimes be more convenient to express a linear program in a more compact form. If we create an m  n matrix A D .a ij /, an m-vector b D .b i /, an n-vector c D .c j /, and an n-vector x D .x j /, then we can rewrite the linear program deûned in (29.11)3(29.13) as maximize c T x (29.14) subject to Ax හ b (29.15) x  0 : (29.16) In line (29.14), c T x is the inner product of two n-vectors. In inequality (29.15), Ax is the m-vector that is the product of an m  n matrix and an n-vector, and in in- equality (29.16), x  0 means that each entry of the vector x must be nonnegative. We call this representation the standard form for a linear program, and we adopt the convention that A, b, and c always have the dimensions given above. The standard form above may not naturally correspond to real-life situations you are trying to model. For example, you might have equality constraints or variables that can take on negative values. Exercises 29.1-6 and 29.1-7 ask you to show how to convert any linear program into this standard form. We now introduce terminology to describe solutions to linear programs. We denote a particular setting of the values in a variable, say x , by putting a bar over the variable name: N x. If N x satisûes all the constraints, then it is a feasible solution, but if it fails to satisfy at least one constraint, then it is an infeasible solution. We say that a solution N x has objective value c T N x. A feasible solution N x whose objective value is maximum over all feasible solutions is an optimal solution, and we call its objective value c T N x the optimal objective value. If a linear program has no feasible solutions, we say that the linear program is infeasible, and otherwise, it is feasible. The set of points that satisfy all the constraints is the feasible region. If a linear program has some feasible solutions but does not have a ûnite optimal objective value, then the feasible region is unbounded and so is the linear program. Exercise 29.1-5 asks you to show that a linear program can have a ûnite optimal objective value even if the feasible region is unbounded. 29.1 Linear programming formulations and algorithms 855 One of the reasons for the power and popularity of linear programming is that linear programs can, in general, be solved efûciently. There are two classes of algorithms, known as ellipsoid algorithms and interior-point algorithms, that solve linear programs in polynomial time. In addition, the simplex algorithm is widely used. Although it does not run in polynomial time in the worst case, it tends to perform well in practice. We will not give a detailed algorithm for linear programming, but will discuss a few important ideas. First, we will give an example of using a geometric procedure to solve a two-variable linear program. Although this example does not immedi- ately generalize to an efûcient algorithm for larger problems, it introduces some important concepts for linear programming and for optimization in general. A two-variable linear program Let us ûrst consider the following linear program with two variables: maximize x 1 C x 2 (29.17) subject to 4x 1  x 2 හ 8 (29.18) 2x 1 C x 2 හ 10 (29.19) 5x 1  2x 2  2 (29.20) x 1 ; x 2  0 : (29.21) Figure 29.2(a) graphs the constraints in the .x 1 ; x 2 /-Cartesian coordinate system. The feasible region in the two-dimensional space (highlighted in blue in the ûg- ure) is convex. 1 Conceptually, you could evaluate the objective function x 1 C x 2 at each point in the feasible region, and then identify a point that has the maximum objective value as an optimal solution. For this example (and for most linear pro- grams), however, the feasible region contains an inûnite number of points, and so to solve this linear program, you need an efûcient way to ûnd a point that achieves the maximum objective value without explicitly evaluating the objective function at every point in the feasible region. In two dimensions, you can optimize via a graphical procedure. The set of points for which x 1 C x 2 D ´, for any ´, is a line with a slope of 1. Plotting x 1 C x 2 D 0 produces the line with slope 1 through the origin, as in Figure 29.2(b). The intersection of this line and the feasible region is the set of feasible solutions that have an objective value of 0. In this case, that intersection of the line with the feasible region is the single point .0; 0/. More generally, for any value ´, the 1 An intuitive deûnition of a convex region is that it fulûlls t he requirement that for any two points in the region, all points on a line segment between them are also in the region. 856 Chapter 29 Linear Programming x 1 + x 2 = 0 4x 1 – x 2 f 8 2x 1 + x 2 f 10 x 2 x 1 x 2 g 0 x 1 g 0 5x 1 – 2x 2 g –2 (a) x 2 x 1 (b) x 1 + x 2 = 4 x 1 + x 2 = 8 Figure 29.2 (a) The linear program given in (29.18)3(29.21). Each constraint is represented by a line and a direction. The intersection of the constraints, which is the feasible region, is highlighted in blue. (b) The red lines show, respectively, the points for which the objective value is 0, 4, and 8. The optimal solution to the linear program is x 1 D 2 and x 2 D 6 with objective value 8. intersection of the line x 1 C x 2 D ´ and the feasible region is the set of feasible solutions that have objective value ´. Figure 29.2(b) shows the lines x 1 C x 2 D 0, x 1 C x 2 D 4, and x 1 C x 2 D 8. Because the feasible region in Figure 29.2 is bounded, there must be some maximum value ´ for which the intersection of the line x 1 C x 2 D ´ and the feasible region is nonempty. Any point in the feasible region that maximizes x 1 C x 2 is an optimal solution to the linear program, which in this case is the vertex of the feasible region at x 1 D 2 and x 2 D 6, with objective value 8. It is no accident that an optimal solution to the linear program occurs at a vertex of the feasible region. The maximum value of ´ for which the line x 1 C x 2 D ´ intersects the feasible region must be on the boundary of the feasible region, and thus the intersection of this line with the boundary of the feasible region is either a single vertex or a line segment. If the intersection is a single vertex, then there is just one optimal solution, and it is that vertex. If the intersection is a line segment, every point on that line segment must have the same objective value. In particular, both endpoints of the line segment are optimal solutions. Since each endpoint of a line segment is a vertex, there is an optimal solution at a vertex in this case as well. Although you cannot easily graph linear programs with more than two variables, the same intuition holds. If you have three variables, then each constraint corre- sponds to a half-space in three-dimensional space. The intersection of these half- 29.1 Linear programming formulations and algorithms 857 spaces forms the feasible region. The set of points for which the objective function obtains a given value ´ is now a plane (assuming no degenerate conditions). If all coefûcients of the objective function are nonnegative, and if the origin is a feasible solution to the linear program, then as you move this plane away from the origin, in a direction normal to the objective function, you ûnd points of increasing objective value. (If the origin is not feasible or if some coefûcients in the objective function are negative, the intuitive picture becomes slightly more complicated.) As in two dimensions, because the feasible region is convex, the set of points that achieve the optimal objective value must include a vertex of the feasible region. Simi- larly, if you have n variables, each constraint deûnes a half-space in n-dimensional space. We call the feasible region formed by the intersection of these half-spaces a simplex. The objective function is now a hyperplane and, because of convexity, an optimal solution still occurs at a vertex of the simplex. Any algorithm for linear programming must also identify linear programs that have no solutions, as well as linear programs that have no ûnite optimal solution. The simplex algorithm takes as input a linear program and returns an optimal solution. It starts at some vertex of the simplex and performs a sequence of itera- tions. In each iteration, it moves along an edge of the simplex from a current vertex to a neighboring vertex whose objective value is no smaller than that of the current vertex (and usually is larger.) The simplex algorithm terminates when it reaches a local maximum, which is a vertex from which all neighboring vertices have a smaller objective value. Because the feasible region is convex and the objective function is linear, this local optimum is actually a global optimum. In Section 29.3, we’ll see an important concept called <duality,= which we’ll use to prove that the solution returned by the simplex algorithm is indeed optimal. The simplex algorithm, when implemented carefully, often solves general lin- ear programs quickly in practice. With some carefully contrived inputs, however, the simplex algorithm can require exponential time. The ûrst polynomial-time al- gorithm for linear programming was the ellipsoid algorithm, which runs slowly in practice. A second class of polynomial-time algorithms are known as interior- point methods. In contrast to the simplex algorithm, which moves along the exte- rior of the feasible region and maintains a feasible solution that is a vertex of the simplex at each iteration, these algorithms move through the interior of the feasible region. The intermediate solutions, while feasible, are not necessarily vertices of the simplex, but the ûnal solution is a vertex. For large inputs, interior-point algo- rithms can run as fast as, and sometimes faster than, the simplex algorithm. The chapter notes point you to more information about these algorithms. If you add to a linear program the additional requirement that all variables take on integer values, you have an integer linear program. Exercise 34.5-3 on page 1098 asks you to show that just ûnding a feasible solution to this problem is NP-hard. Since no polynomial-time algorithms are known for any NP-hard prob- 858 Chapter 29 Linear Programming lems, there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for integer linear programming. In contrast, a general linear-programming problem can be solved in polynomial time.

Show how to convert an inequality constraint P n j D1 a ij x j හ b i into an equal- ity constraint and a nonnegativity constraint. You will need to introduce an additional variable s , and use the constraint that s  0. 29.1-7 Explain how to convert a minimization linear program to an equivalent maximiza- tion linear program, and argue that your new linear program is equivalent to the original one. 29.1-8 In the political problem at the beginning of this chapter, there are feasible solutions that correspond to winning more voters than there actually are in the district. For example, you can set x 2 to 200, x 3 to 200, and x 1 D x 4 D 0. That solution is feasible, yet it seems to say that you will win 400,000 suburban voters, even though there are only 200,000 actual suburban voters. What constraints can you add to the linear program to ensure that you never seem to win more voters than there actually are? Even if you don’t add these constraints, argue that the optimal solution to this linear program can never win more voters than there actually are in the district. 860 Chapter 29 Linear Programming 29.2 Formulating problems as linear programs Linear programming has many applications. Any textbook on operations research is ûlled with examples of linear programming, and linear programming has become a standard tool taught to students in most business schools. The election scenario is one typical example. Here are two more examples:  An airline wishes to schedule its üight crews. The Federal Aviation Adminis- tration imposes several constraints, such as limiting the number of consecutive hours that each crew member can work and insisting that a particular crew work only on one model of aircraft during each month. The airline wants to schedule crews on all of its üights using as few crew members as possible.  An oil company wants to decide where to drill for oil. Siting a drill at a particu- lar location has an associated cost and, based on geological surveys, an expected payoff of some number of barrels of oil. The company has a limited budget for locating new drills and wants to maximize the amount of oil it expects to ûnd, given this budget. Linear programs also model and solve graph and combinatorial problems, such as those appearing in this book. We have already seen a special case of linear programming used to solve systems of difference constraints in Section 22.4. In this section, we’ll study how to formulate several graph and network-üow problems as linear programs. Section 35.4 uses linear programming as a tool to ûnd an approximate solution to another graph problem. Perhaps the most important aspect of linear programming is to be able to rec- ognize when you can formulate a problem as a linear program. Once you cast a problem as a polynomial-sized linear program, you can solve it in polynomial time by the ellipsoid algorithm or interior-point methods. Several linear-programming software packages can solve problems efûciently, so that once the problem is in the form of a linear program, such a package can solve it. We’ll look at several concrete examples of linear-programming problems. We start with two problems that we have already studied: the single-source shortest- paths problem from Chapter 22 and the maximum-üow problem from Chapter 24. We then describe the minimum-cost-üow problem. (Although the minimum-cost- üow problem has a polynomial-time algorithm that is not based on linear program- ming, we won’t describe the algorithm.) Finally, we describe the multicommodity- üow problem, for which the only known polynomial-time algorithm is based on linear programming. When we solved graph problems in Part VI, we used attribute notation, such as v: d and .u; v/: f . Linear programs typically use subscripted variables rather than 29.2 Formulating problems as linear programs 861 objects with attached attributes, however. Therefore, when we express variables in linear programs, we indicate vertices and edges through subscripts. For example, we denote the shortest-path weight for vertex v not by v: d but by d v , and we denote the üow from vertex u to vertex v not by .u; v/: f but by f uv . For quantities that are given as inputs to problems, such as edge weights or capacities, we continue to use notations such as w.u; v/ and c.u; v/. Shortest paths We can formulate the single-source shortest-paths problem as a linear program. We’ll focus on how to formulate the single-pair shortest-path problem, leaving the extension to the more general single-source shortest-paths problem as Exer- cise 29.2-2. In the single-pair shortest-path problem, the input is a weighted, directed graph G D .V; E/, with weight function w W E ! R mapping edges to real-valued weights, a source vertex s , and destination vertex t . The goal is to compute the value d t , which is the weight of a shortest path from s to t . To express this prob- lem as a linear program, you need to determine a set of variables and constraints that deûne when you have a shortest path from s to t . The triangle inequality (Lemma 22.10 on page 633) gives d v හ d u C w.u; v/ for each edge .u; v/ 2 E. The source vertex initially receives a value d s D 0, which never changes. Thus the following linear program expresses the shortest-path weight from s to t : maximize d t (29.22) subject to d v හ d u C w.u; v/ for each edge .u; v/ 2 E (29.23) d s D 0 : (29.24) You might be surprised that this linear program maximizes an objective function when it is supposed to compute shortest paths. Minimizing the objective function would be a mistake, because when all the edge weights are nonnegative, setting N d v D 0 for all v 2 V (recall that a bar over a variable name denotes a speciûc setting of the variable’s value) would yield an optimal solution to the linear pro- gram without solving the shortest-paths problem. Maximizing is the right thing to do because an optimal solution to the shortest-paths problem sets each N d v to min ˚ N d u C w.u; v/ W u 2 V and .u; v/ 2 E  , so that N d v is the largest value that is less than or equal to all of the values in the set ˚ N d u C w.u; v/  . Therefore, it makes sense to maximize d v for all vertices v on a shortest path from s to t subject to these constraints, and maximizing d t achieves this goal. This linear program has jV j variables d v , one for each vertex v 2 V . It also has jEj C 1 constraints: one for each edge, plus the additional constraint that the source vertex’s shortest-path weight always has the value 0. 862 Chapter 29 Linear Programming Maximum üow Next, let’s express the maximum-üow problem as a linear program. Recall that the input is a directed graph G D .V; E/ in which each edge .u; v/ 2 E has a nonnegative capacity c.u; v/  0, and two distinguished vertices: a source s and a sink t . As deûned in Section 24.1, a üow is a nonnegative real-valued function f W V  V ! R that satisûes the capacity constraint and üow conservation. A maximum üow is a üow that satisûes these constraints and maximizes the üow value, which is the total üow coming out of the source minus the total üow into the source. A üow, therefore, satisûes linear constraints, and the value of a üow is a linear function. Recalling also that we assume that c.u; v/ D 0 if .u; v/ … E and that there are no antiparallel edges, the maximum-üow problem can be expressed as a linear program: maximize X v2V f sv  X v2V f vs (29.25) subject to f uv හ c.u; v/ for each u; v 2 V (29.26) X v2V f vu D X v2V f uv for each u 2 V  fs; t g (29.27) f uv  0 for each u; v 2 V : (29.28) This linear program has jV j 2 variables, corresponding to the üow between each pair of vertices, and it has 2 jV j 2 C jV j  2 constraints. It is usually more efûcient to solve a smaller-sized linear program. The linear program in (29.25)3(29.28) has, for ease of notation, a üow and capacity of 0 for each pair of vertices u; v with .u; v/ … E. It is more efûcient to rewrite the linear program so that it has O.V C E/ constraints. Exercise 29.2-4 asks you to do so. Minimum-cost üow In this section, we have used linear programming to solve problems for which we already knew efûcient algorithms. In fact, an efûcient algorithm designed specif- ically for a problem, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm for the single-source shortest- paths problem, will often be more efûcient than linear programming, both in theory and in practice. The real power of linear programming comes from the ability to solve new prob- lems. Recall the problem faced by the politician in the beginning of this chapter. The problem of obtaining a sufûcient number of votes, while not spending too much money, is not solved by any of the algorithms that we have studied in this book, yet it can be solved by linear programming. Books abound with such real- world problems that linear programming can solve. Linear programming is also 29.2 Formulating problems as linear programs 863 s x t y (a) c = 1 a = 3 c = 5 a = 2 c = 4 a = 1 c = 2 a = 7 c = 2 a = 5 s x t y (b) 1/1 a = 3 2/5 a = 2 3/4 a = 1 1/2 a = 7 2/2 a = 5 Figure 29.3 (a) An example of a minimum-cost-üow problem. Capacities are denoted by c and costs by a. Vertex s is the source, and vertex t is the sink. The goal is to send 4 units of üow from s to t . (b) A solution to the minimum-cost üow problem in which 4 units of üow are sent from s to t . For each edge, the üow and capacity are written as üow/capacity. particularly useful for solving variants of problems for which we may not already know of an efûcient algorithm. Consider, for example, the following generalization of the maximum-üow prob- lem. Suppose that, in addition to a capacity c.u; v/ for each edge .u; v/, you are given a real-valued cost a.u; v/. As in the maximum-üow problem, assume that c.u; v/ D 0 if .u; v/ … E and that there are no antiparallel edges. If you send f uv units of üow over edge .u; v/, you incur a cost of a.u; v/  f uv . You are also given a üow demand d . You wish to send d units of üow from s to t while minimizing the total cost P .u;v/2E a.u; v/  f uv incurred by the üow. This problem is known as the minimum-cost-üow problem. Figure 29.3(a) shows an example of the minimum-cost-üow problem, with a goal of sending 4 units of üow from s to t while incurring the minimum total cost. Any particular legal üow, that is, a function f satisfying constraints (29.26)3(29.28), incurs a total cost of P .u;v/2E a.u; v/  f uv . What is the particular 4-unit üow that minimizes this cost? Figure 29.3(b) shows an optimal solution, with total cost P .u;v/2E a.u; v/  f uv D .2  2/ C .5  2/ C .3  1/ C .7  1/ C .1  3/ D 27: There are polynomial-time algorithms speciûcally designed for the minimum- cost-üow problem, but they are beyond the scope of this book. The minimum-cost- üow problem can be expressed as a linear program, however. The linear program looks similar to the one for the maximum-üow problem with the additional con- straint that the value of the üow must be exactly d units, and with the new objective function of minimizing the cost: 864 Chapter 29 Linear Programming minimize X .u;v/2E a.u; v/  f uv (29.29) subject to f uv හ c.u; v/ for each u; v 2 V X v2V f vu  X v2V f uv D 0 for each u 2 V  fs; t g X v2V f sv  X v2V f vs D d f uv  0 for each u; v 2 V : (29.30) Multicommodity üow As a ûnal example, let’s consider another üow problem. Suppose that the Lucky Puck company from Section 24.1 decides to diversify its product line and ship not only hockey pucks, but also hockey sticks and hockey helmets. Each piece of equipment is manufactured in its own factory, has its own warehouse, and must be shipped, each day, from factory to warehouse. The sticks are manufactured in Vancouver and are needed in Saskatoon, and the helmets are manufactured in Edmonton and must be shipped to Regina. The capacity of the shipping network does not change, however, and the different items, or commodities, must share the same network. This example is an instance of a multicommodity-üow problem. The input to this problem is once again a directed graph G D .V; E/ in which each edge .u; v/ 2 E has a nonnegative capacity c.u; v/  0. As in the maximum-üow problem, implic- itly assume that c.u; v/ D 0 for .u; v/ … E and that the graph has no antiparallel edges. In addition, there are k different commodities, K 1 ; K 2 ; : : : ; K k , with com- modity i speciûed by the triple K i D .s i ; t i ; d i /. Here, vertex s i is the source of commodity i , vertex t i is the sink of commodity i , and d i is the demand for com- modity i , which is the desired üow value for the commodity from s i to t i . We deûne a üow for commodity i , denoted by f i , (so that f i uv is the üow of com- modity i from vertex u to vertex v) to be a real-valued function that satisûes the üow-conservation and capacity constraints. We deûne f uv , the aggregate üow, to be the sum of the various commodity üows, so that f uv D P k i D1 f i uv . The aggre- gate üow on edge .u; v/ must be no more than the capacity of edge .u; v/. This problem has no objective function: the question is to determine whether such a üow exists. Thus the linear program for this problem has a <null= objective function: 29.2 Formulating problems as linear programs 865 minimize 0 subject to k X i D1 f i uv හ c.u; v/ for each u; v 2 V X v2V f i uv  X v2V f ivu D 0 for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; k and for each u 2 V  fs i ; t i g X v2V f i;s i ;v  X v2V f i;v;s i D d i for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; k f i uv  0 for each u; v 2 V and for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; k : The only known polynomial-time algorithm for this problem expresses it as a linear program and then solves it with a polynomial-time linear-programming algorithm. Exercises 29.2-1 Write out explicitly the linear program corresponding to ûnding the shortest path from vertex s to vertex x in Figure 22.2(a) on page 609. 29.2-2 Given a graph G, write a linear program for the single-source shortest-paths prob- lem. The solution should have the property that d v is the shortest-path weight from the source vertex s to v for each vertex v 2 V . 29.2-3 Write out explicitly the linear program corresponding to ûnding the maximum üow in Figure 24.1(a). 29.2-4 Rewrite the linear program for maximum üow (29.25)3(29.28) so that it uses only O.V C E/ constraints. 29.2-5 Write a linear program that, given a bipartite graph G D .V; E/, solves the maxi- mum-bipartite-matching problem. 29.2-6 There can be more than one way to model a particular problem as a linear program. This exercise gives an alternative formulation for the maximum-üow problem. Let P D fP 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P p g be the set of all possible directed simple paths from source s 866 Chapter 29 Linear Programming to sink t . Using decision variables x 1 ; : : : ; x p , where x i is the amount of üow on path i , formulate a linear program for the maximum-üow problem. What is an upper bound on p, the number of directed simple paths from s to t ? 29.2-7 In the minimum-cost multicommodity-üow problem, the input is a directed graph G D .V; E/ in which each edge .u; v/ 2 E has a nonnegative capacity c.u; v/  0 and a cost a.u; v/. As in the multicommodity-üow problem, there are k dif- ferent commodities, K 1 ; K 2 ; : : : ; K k , with commodity i speciûed by the triple K i D .s i ; t i ; d i /. We deûne the üow f i for commodity i and the aggregate üow f uv on edge .u; v/ as in the multicommodity-üow problem. A feasible üow is one in which the aggregate üow on each edge .u; v/ is no more than the capacity of edge .u; v/. The cost of a üow is P u;v2V a.u; v/  f uv , and the goal is to ûnd the feasible üow of minimum cost. Express this problem as a linear program. 29.3 Duality We will now introduce a powerful concept called linear-programming duality. In general, given a maximization problem, duality allows you to formulate a related minimization problem that has the same objective value. The idea of duality is actually more general than linear programming, but we restrict our attention to linear programming in this section. Duality enables us to prove that a solution is indeed optimal. We saw an exam- ple of duality in Chapter 24 with Theorem 24.6, the max-üow min-cut theorem. Suppose that, given an instance of a maximum-üow problem, you ûnd a üow f with value jf j. How do you know whether f is a maximum üow? By the max- üow min-cut theorem, if you can ûnd a cut whose value is also jf j, then you have veriûed that f is indeed a maximum üow. This relationship provides an example of duality: given a maximization problem, deûne a related minimization problem such that the two problems have the same optimal objective values. Given a linear program in standard form in which the objective is to maximize, let’s see how to formulate a dual linear program in which the objective is to min- imize and whose optimal value is identical to that of the original linear program. When referring to dual linear programs, we call the original linear program the primal. Given the primal linear program 29.3 Duality 867 maximize n X j D1 c j x j (29.31) subject to n X j D1 a ij x j හ b i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m (29.32) x j  0 for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n ; (29.33) its dual is minimize m X i D1 b i y i (29.34) subject to m X i D1 a ij y i  c j for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n (29.35) y i  0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m : (29.36) Mechanically, to form the dual, change the maximization to a minimization, exchange the roles of coefûcients on the right-hand sides and in the objective func- tion, and replace each හ by . Each of the m constraints in the primal corresponds to a variable y i in the dual. Likewise, each of the n constraints in the dual corre- sponds to a variable x j in the primal. For example, consider the following primal linear program: maximize 3x 1 C x 2 C 4x 3 (29.37) subject to x 1 C x 2 C 3x 3 හ 30 (29.38) 2x 1 C 2x 2 C 5x 3 හ 24 (29.39) 4x 1 C x 2 C 2x 3 හ 36 (29.40) x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3  0 : (29.41) Its dual is minimize 30y 1 C 24y 2 C 36y 3 (29.42) subject to y 1 C 2y 2 C 4y 3  3 (29.43) y 1 C 2y 2 C y 3  1 (29.44) 3y 1 C 5y 2 C 2y 3  4 (29.45) y 1 ; y 2 ; y 3  0 : (29.46) Although forming the dual can be considered a mechanical operation, there is an intuitive explanation. Consider the primal maximization problem (29.37)3(29.41). Each constraint gives an upper bound on the objective function. In addition, if you 868 Chapter 29 Linear Programming take one or more constraints and add together nonnegative multiples of them, you get a valid constraint. For example, you can add constraints (29.38) and (29.39) to obtain the constraint 3x 1 C 3x 2 C 8x 3 හ 54. Any feasible solution to the primal must satisfy this new constraint, but there is something else interesting about it. Comparing this new constraint to the objective function (29.37), you can see that for each variable, the corresponding coefûcient is at least as large as the coefûcient in the objective function. Thus, since the variables x 1 , x 2 and x 3 are nonnegative, we have that 3x 1 C x 2 C 4x 3 හ 3x 1 C 3x 2 C 8x 3 හ 54 ; and so the solution value to the primal is at most 54. In other words, adding these two constraints together has generated an upper bound on the objective value. In general, for any nonnegative multipliers y 1 , y 2 , and y 3 , you can generate a constraint 1 .x 1 Cx 2 C3x 3 /Cy 2 .2x 1 C2x 2 C5x 3 /Cy 3 .4x 1 Cx 2 C2x 3 / හ 30y 1 C24y 2 C36y 3 from the primal constraints or, by distributing and regrouping, .y 1 C2y 2 C4y 3 /x 1 C.y 1 C2y 2 Cy 3 /x 2 C.3y 1 C5y 2 C2y 3 /x 3 හ 30y 1 C24y 2 C36y 3 : Now, as long as this constraint has coefûcients of x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 that are at least their objective-function coefûcients, it is a valid upper bound. That is, as long as y 1 C 2y 2 C 4y 3  3 ; y 1 C 2y 2 C y 3  1 ; 3y 1 C 5y 2 C 2y 3  4 ; you have a valid upper bound of 30y 1 C24y 2 C36y 3 . The multipliers y 1 , y 2 , and y 3 must be nonnegative, because otherwise you cannot combine the inequalities. Of course, you would like the upper bound to be as small as possible, and so you want to choose y to minimize 30y 1 C 24y 2 C 36y 3 . Observe that we have just described the dual linear program as the problem of ûnding the smallest possible upper bound on the primal. We’ll formalize this idea and show in Theorem 29.4 that, if the linear program and its dual are feasible and bounded, then the optimal value of the dual linear program is always equal to the optimal value of the primal linear program. We begin by demonstrating weak duality, which states that any feasible solution to the primal linear program has a value no greater than that of any feasible solution to the dual linear program. Lemma 29.1 (Weak linear-programming duality) Let N x be any feasible solution to the primal linear program in (29.31)3(29.33), and let N y be any feasible solution to its dual linear program in (29.34)3(29.36). Then 29.3 Duality 869 n X j D1 c j N x j හ m X i D1 b i N y i : Proof We have n X j D1 c j N x j හ n X j D1  m X i D1 a ij N y i ! N x j (by inequalities (29.35)) D m X i D1  n X j D1 a ij N x j ! N y i හ m X i D1 b i N y i (by inequalities (29.32)) . Corollary 29.2 Let N x be a feasible solution to the primal linear program in (29.31)3(29.33), and let N y be a feasible solution to its dual linear program in (29.34)3(29.36). If n X j D1 c j N x j D m X i D1 b i N y i ; then N x and N y are optimal solutions to the primal and dual linear programs, respec- tively. Proof By Lemma 29.1, the objective value of a feasible solution to the primal cannot exceed that of a feasible solution to the dual. The primal linear program is a maximization problem and the dual is a minimization problem. Thus, if feasible solutions N x and N y have the same objective value, neither can be improved. We now show that, at optimality, the primal and dual objective values are indeed equal. To prove linear programming duality, we will require one lemma from linear algebra, known as Farkas’s lemma, the proof of which Problem 29-4 asks you to provide. Farkas’s lemma can take several forms, each of which is about when a set of linear equalities has a solution. In stating the lemma, we use m C 1 as a dimension because it matches our use below. Lemma 29.3 (Farkas’s lemma) Given M 2 R .mC1/n and g 2 R mC1 , exactly one of the following statements is true: 1. There exists v 2 R n such that M v හ g, 2. There exists w 2 R mC1 such that w  0; w T M D 0 (an n-vector of all zeros), and w T g < 0. 870 Chapter 29 Linear Programming Theorem 29.4 (Linear-programming duality) Given the primal linear program in (29.31)3(29.33) and its corresponding dual in (29.34)3(29.36), if both are feasible and bounded, then for optimal solutions x  and y  , we have c T x  D b T y  . Proof Let � D b T y  be the optimal value of the dual linear program given in (29.34)3(29.36). Consider an augmented set of primal constraints in which we add a constraint to (29.31)3(29.33) that the objective value is at least �. We write out this augmented primal as Ax හ b ; (29.47) c T x  � : (29.48) We can multiply (29.48) through by 1 and rewrite (29.47)3(29.48) as Ï A c T Ð x හ Ï b � Ð : (29.49) Here, Ï A c T Ð denotes an .mC1/n matrix, x is an n-vector, and Ï b � Ð denotes an .m C 1/-vector. We claim that if there is a feasible solution N x to the augmented primal, then the theorem is proved. To establish this claim, observe that N x is also a feasible solution to the original primal and that it has objective value at least �. We can then apply Lemma 29.1, which states that the objective value of the primal is at most �, to complete the proof of the theorem. It therefore remains to show that the augmented primal has a feasible solution. Suppose, for the purpose of contradiction, that the augmented primal is infeasible, which means that there is no v 2 R n such that Ï A c T Ð v හ Ï b � Ð . We can apply Farkas’s lemma, Lemma 29.3, to inequalty (29.49) with M D Ï A c T Ð and g D Ï b � Ð : Because the augmented primal is infeasible, condition 1 of Farkas’s lemma does not hold. Therefore, condition 2 must apply, so that there must exist a w 2 R mC1 such that w  0, w T M D 0, and w T g < 0. Let’s write w as w D Ï N y � Ð for some N y 2 R m and � 2 R, where N y  0 and �  0. Substituting for w, M , and g in condition 2 gives N y � Ð T Ï A c T Ð D 0 and Ï N y � Ð T Ï b � Ð < 0 : 29.3 Duality 871 Unpacking the matrix notation gives N y T A  �c T D 0 and N y T b  �� < 0 : (29.50) We now show that the requirements in (29.50) contradict the assumption that � is the optimal solution value for the dual linear program. We consider two cases. The ûrst case is when � D 0. In this case, (29.50) simpliûes to N y T A D 0 and N y T b < 0 : (29.51) We’ll now construct a dual feasible solution y 0 with an objective value smaller than b T y  . Set y 0 D y  C � N y , for any � > 0. Since y 0 T A D .y  C � N y/ T A D y T A C � N y T A D y T A (by (29.51))  c T (because y  is feasible) , y 0 is feasible. Now consider the objective value b T y 0 D b T .y  C � N y/ D b T y  C �b T N y < b T y  ; where the last inequality follows because � > 0 and, by (29.51), N y T b D b T N y < 0 (since both N y T b and b T N y are the inner product of b and N y ), and so their product is negative. Thus we have a feasible dual solution of value less than �, which contradicts � being the optimal objective value. We now consider the second case, where � > 0. In this case, we can take (29.50) and divide through by � to obtain . N y T =�/A  .�=�/c T D 0 and . N y T =�/b  .�=�/� < 0 : (29.52) Now set y 0 D N y=� in (29.52), giving y 0 T A D c T and y 0 T b < � : Thus, y 0 is a feasible dual solution with objective value strictly less than �, a contradiction. We conclude that the augmented primal has a feasible solution, and the theorem is proved. Fundamental theorem of linear programming We conclude this chapter by stating the fundamental theorem of linear program- ming, which extends Theorem 29.4 to the cases when the linear program may be either feasible or unbounded. Exercise 29.3-8 asks you to provide the proof. 872 Chapter 29 Linear Programming Theorem 29.5 (Fundamental theorem of linear programming) Any linear program, given in standard form, either 1. has an optimal solution with a ûnite objective value, 2. is infeasible, or 3. is unbounded. Exercises 29.3-1 Formulate the dual of the linear program given in lines (29.6)3(29.10) on page 852. 29.3-2 You have a linear program that is not in standard form.

Let N x be a feasible solution to the primal linear program given in (29.31)3(29.33), and let N y be a feasible solution to the dual linear program given in (29.34)3(29.36). Complementary slackness states that the following conditions are necessary and sufûcient for N x and N y to be optimal: 874 Chapter 29 Linear Programming m X i D1 a ij N y i D c j or N x j D 0 for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n and n X j D1 a ij N x j D b i or N y i D 0 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m : a.

Instead, the input, as be- fore, contains a üow network, capacity constraints c.u; v/, and edge costs a.u; v/. A üow is feasible if it satisûes the capacity constraint on every edge and üow con- servation at every vertex. The goal is to ûnd, among all feasible üows, the one of minimum cost. We call this problem the minimum-cost-circulation problem. a. Formulate the minimum-cost-circulation problem as a linear program. b. Suppose that for all edges .u; v/ 2 E, we have a.u; v/ > 0 .

Formulate the single-source shortest-path problem as a minimum-cost-circu- lation problem linear program. Chapter notes This chapter only begins to study the wide ûeld of linear programming. A num- ber of books are devoted exclusively to linear programming, including those by Chv´ atal [94], Gass [178], Karloff [246], Schrijver [398], and Vanderbei [444]. Many other books give a good coverage of linear programming, including those by Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [353] and Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin [7]. The coverage in this chapter draws on the approach taken by Chv´ atal. The simplex algorithm for linear programming was invented by G. Dantzig in 1947. Shortly after, researchers discovered how to formulate a number of prob- lems in a variety of ûelds as linear programs and solve them with the simplex algorithm. As a result, applications of linear programming üourished, along with several algorithms. Variants of the simplex algorithm remain the most popular 876 Chapter 29 Linear Programming methods for solving linear-programming problems. This history appears in a num- ber of places, including the notes in [94] and [246]. The ellipsoid algorithm was the ûrst polynomial-time algorithm for linear pro- gramming and is due to L. G. Khachian in 1979. It was based on earlier work by N. Z. Shor, D. B. Judin, and A. S. Nemirovskii. Gr¨ otschel, Lov´ asz, and Schrijver [201] describe how to use the ellipsoid algorithm to solve a variety of problems in combinatorial optimization. To date, the ellipsoid algorithm does not appear to be competitive with the simplex algorithm in practice. Karmarkar’s paper [247] includes a description of the ûrst interior-point algo- rithm. Many subsequent researchers designed interior-point algorithms. Good sur- veys appear in the article of Goldfarb and Todd [189] and the book by Ye [463]. Analysis of the simplex algorithm remains an active area of research. V. Klee and G. J. Minty constructed an example on which the simplex algorithm runs through 2 n  1 iterations. The simplex algorithm usually performs well in practice, and many researchers have tried to give theoretical justiûcation for this empirical observation. A line of research begun by K. H. Borgwardt, and carried on by many others, shows that under certain probabilistic assumptions on the input, the sim- plex algorithm converges in expected polynomial time. Spielman and Teng [421] made progress in this area, introducing the <smoothed analysis of algorithms= and applying it to the simplex algorithm. The simplex algorithm is known to run efûciently in certain special cases. Par- ticularly noteworthy is the network-simplex algorithm, which is the simplex al- gorithm, specialized to network-üow problems. For certain network problems, including the shortest-paths, maximum-üow, and minimum-cost-üow problems, variants of the network-simplex algorithm run in polynomial time. See, for exam- ple, the article by Orlin [349] and the citations therein. 30 Polynomials and the FFT The straightforward method of adding two polynomials of degree n takes ‚.n/ time, but the straightforward method of multiplying them takes ‚.n 2 / time. This chapter will show how the fast Fourier transform, or FFT, can reduce the time to multiply polynomials to ‚.n lg n/. The most common use for Fourier transforms, and hence the FFT, is in signal processing. A signal is given in the time domain: as a function mapping time to amplitude. Fourier analysis expresses the signal as a weighted sum of phase- shifted sinusoids of varying frequencies. The weights and phases associated with the frequencies characterize the signal in the frequency domain. Among the many everyday applications of FFT’s are compression techniques used to encode digital video and audio information, including MP3 ûles. Many ûne books delve into the rich area of signal processing, and the chapter notes reference a few of them. Polynomials A polynomial in the variable x over an algebraic ûeld F represents a function A.x/ as a formal sum: A.x/ D n1 X j D0 a j x j : The values a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 are the coefûcients of the polynomial. The coefûcients and x are drawn from a ûeld F , typically the set C of complex numbers. A poly- nomial A.x/ has degree k if its highest nonzero coefûcient is a k , in which case we say that degree.A/ D k. Any integer strictly greater than the degree of a polyno- mial is a degree-bound of that polynomial. Therefore, the degree of a polynomial of degree-bound n may be any integer between 0 and n  1, inclusive. A variety of operations extend to polynomials. For polynomial addition, if A.x/ and B.x/ are polynomials of degree-bound n, their sum is a polynomial C.x/, also 878 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT of degree-bound n, such that C.x/ D A.x/ C B.x/ for all x in the underlying ûeld. That is, if A.x/ D n1 X j D0 a j x j and B.x/ D n1 X j D0 b j x j ; then C.x/ D n1 X j D0 c j x j ; where c j D a j C b j for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. For example, given the polyno- mials A.x/ D 6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9 and B.x/ D 2x 3 C 4x  5, their sum is C.x/ D 4x 3 C 7x 2  6x C 4. For polynomial multiplication, if A.x/ and B.x/ are polynomials of degree- bound n, their product C.x/ is a polynomial of degree-bound 2n  1 such that C.x/ D A.x/B.x/ for all x in the underlying ûeld. You probably have multi- plied polynomials before, by multiplying each term in A.x/ by each term in B.x/ and then combining terms with equal powers. For example, you can multiply A.x/ D 6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9 and B.x/ D 2x 3 C 4x  5 as follows: 6x 3 C 7x 2  10x C 9  2x 3 C 4x  5  30x 3  35x 2 C 50x  45 (multiply A.x/ by 5) 24x 4 C 28x 3  40x 2 C 36x (multiply A.x/ by 4x )  12x 6  14x 5 C 20x 4  18x 3 (multiply A.x/ by 2x 3 )  12x 6  14x 5 C 44x 4  20x 3  75x 2 C 86x  45 Another way to express the product C.x/ is C.x/ D 2n2 X j D0 c j x j ; (30.1) where j D j X kD0 a k b j k ; (30.2) (By the deûnition of degree, a k D 0 for all k > degree.A/ and b k D 0 for all k > degree.B/.) If A is a polynomial of degree-bound n a and B is a polynomial of degree-bound n b , then C must be a polynomial of degree-bound n a C n b  1, because degree.C / D degree.A/ C degree.B/. Since a polynomial of degree- bound k is also a polynomial of degree-bound k C 1, we normally make the some- what simpler statement that the product polynomial C is a polynomial of degree- bound n a C n b . 30.1 Representing polynomials 879 Chapter outline Section 30.1 presents two ways to represent polynomials: the coefûcient represen- tation and the point-value representation. The straightforward method for multiply- ing polynomials of degree n4equations (30.1) and (30.2)4takes ‚.n 2 / time with polynomials represented in coefûcient form, but only ‚.n/ time with point-value form. Converting between the two representations, however, reduces the time to multiply polynomials to just ‚.n lg n/. To see why this approach works, you must ûrst understand complex roots of unity, which Section 30.2 covers. Section 30.2 then uses the FFT and its inverse to perform the conversions. Because the FFT is used so often in signal processing, it is often implemented as a circuit in hardware, and Section 30.3 illustrates the structure of such circuits. This chapter relies on complex numbers, and within this chapter the symbol i denotes p 1 exclusively. 30.1 Representing polynomials The coefûcient and point-value representations of polynomials are in a sense equiv- alent: a polynomial in point-value form has a unique counterpart in coefûcient form. This section introduces the two representations and shows how to combine them in order to multiply two degree-bound n polynomials in ‚.n lg n/ time. Coefûcient representation A coefûcient representation of a polynomial A.x/ D P n1 j D0 a j x j of degree- bound n is a vector of coefûcients a D .a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 /. Matrix equations in this chapter generally treat vectors as column vectors. The coefûcient representation is convenient for certain operations on polyno- mials. For example, the operation of evaluating the polynomial A.x/ at a given point x 0 consists of computing the value of A.x 0 /. To evaluate a polynomial in ‚.n/ time, use Horner’s rule: A.x 0 / D a 0 C x 0 Î a 1 C x 0  a 2 C    C x 0 ã a n2 C x 0 .a n1 / ä    Í Ï : Similarly, adding two polynomials represented by the coefûcient vectors a D .a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 / and b D .b 0 ; b 1 ; : : : ; b n1 / takes ‚.n/ time: just produce the co- efûcient vector c D .c 0 ; c 1 ; : : : ; c n1 /, where c j D a j C b j for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. Now, consider multiplying two degree-bound n polynomials A.x/ and B.x/ rep- resented in coefûcient form. The method described by equations (30.1) and (30.2) takes ‚.n 2 / time, since it multiplies each coefûcient in the vector a by each co- 880 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT efûcient in the vector b. The operation of multiplying polynomials in coefûcient form seems to be considerably more difûcult than that of evaluating a polynomial or adding two polynomials. The resulting coefûcient vector c , given by equa- tion (30.2), is also called the convolution of the input vectors a and b, denoted c D a ˝ b. Since multiplying polynomials and computing convolutions are funda- mental computational problems of considerable practical importance, this chapter concentrates on efûcient algorithms for them. Point-value representation A point-value representation of a polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n is a set of n point-value pairs f.x 0 ; y 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 /; : : : ; .x n1 ; y n1 /g such that all of the x k are distinct and y k D A.x k / (30.3) for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. A polynomial has many different point-value representa- tions, since any set of n distinct points x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x n1 can serve as a basis for the representation. Computing a point-value representation for a polynomial given in coefûcient form is in principle straightforward, since all you have to do is select n distinct points x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x n1 and then evaluate A.x k / for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. With Horner’s method, evaluating a polynomial at n points takes ‚.n 2 / time. We’ll see later that if you choose the points x k cleverly, you can accelerate this computation to run in ‚.n lg n/ time. The inverse of evaluation4determining the coefûcient form of a polynomial from a point-value representation4is interpolation. The following theorem shows that interpolation is well deûned when the desired interpolating polynomial must have a degree-bound equal to the given number of point-value pairs. Theorem 30.1 (Uniqueness of an interpolating polynomial) For any set f.x 0 ; y 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 /; : : : ; .x n1 ; y n1 /g of n point-value pairs such that all the x k values are distinct, there is a unique polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n such that y k D A.x k / for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. Proof The proof relies on the existence of the inverse of a certain matrix. Equa- tion (30.3) is equivalent to the matrix equation 30.1 Representing polynomials 881 ˙ 1 x 0 x 2 0    x n1 0 1 x 1 x 2 1    x n1 1 : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 1 x n1 x 2 n1    x n1 n1 ˙ a 0 a 1 : : : a n1  D ˙ y 0 y 1 : : : y n1  : (30.4) The matrix on the left is denoted V .x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x n1 / and is known as a Vander- monde matrix. By Problem D-1 on page 1223, this matrix has determinant Y 0හj <kහn1 .x k  x j / ; and therefore, by Theorem D.5 on page 1221, it is invertible (that is, nonsingular) if the x k are distinct. To solve for the coefûcients a j uniquely given the point-value representation, use the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix: a D V .x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x n1 / 1 y : The proof of Theorem 30.1 describes an algorithm for interpolation based on solving the set (30.4) of linear equations. Section 28.1 shows how to solve these equations in O.n 3 / time. A faster algorithm for n-point interpolation is based on Lagrange’s formula: A.x/ D n1 X kD0 y k Y j ¤k .x  x j / Y j ¤k .x k  x j / : (30.5) You might want to verify that the right-hand side of equation (30.5) is a polynomial of degree-bound n that satisûes A.x k / D y k for all k. Exercise 30.1-5 asks you how to compute the coefûcients of A using Lagrange’s formula in ‚.n 2 / time. Thus, n-point evaluation and interpolation are well-deûned inverse operations that transform between the coefûcient representation of a polynomial and a point- value representation. 1 The algorithms described above for these problems take ‚.n 2 / time. The point-value representation is quite convenient for many operations on poly- nomials. For addition, if C.x/ D A.x/ C B.x/, then C.x k / D A.x k / C B.x k / for any point x k . More precisely, given point-value representations for A, f.x 0 ; y 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 /; : : : ; .x n1 ; y n1 /g ; 1 Interpolation is a notoriously tricky problem from the point of view of numerical stability. Although the approaches described here are mathematically correct, small differences in the inputs or round-off errors during computation can cause large differences in the result. 882 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT and for B , f.x 0 ; y 0 0 /; .x 1 ; y 0 1 /; : : : ; .x n1 ; y 0 n1 /g ; where A and B are evaluated at the same n points, then a point-value representation for C is f.x 0 ; y 0 C y 0 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 C y 0 1 /; : : : ; .x n1 ; y n1 C y 0 n1 /g : Thus the time to add two polynomials of degree-bound n in point-value form is ‚.n/. Similarly, the point-value representation is convenient for multiplying polyno- mials. If C.x/ D A.x/B.x/, then C.x k / D A.x k /B.x k / for any point x k , and to obtain a point-value representation for C , just pointwise multiply a point-value representation for A by a point-value representation for B . Polynomial multipli- cation differs from polynomial addition in one key aspect, however: degree.C / D degree.A/ C degree.B/, so that if A and B have degree-bound n, then C has degree-bound 2n. A standard point-value representation for A and B consists of n point-value pairs for each polynomial. Multiplying these together gives n point- value pairs, but 2n pairs are necessary to interpolate a unique polynomial C of degree-bound 2n. (See Exercise 30.1-4.) Instead, begin with <extended= point- value representations for A and for B consisting of 2n point-value pairs each. Given an extended point-value representation for A, f.x 0 ; y 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 /; : : : ; .x 2n1 ; y 2n1 /g ; and a corresponding extended point-value representation for B , f.x 0 ; y 0 0 /; .x 1 ; y 0 1 /; : : : ; .x 2n1 ; y 0 2n1 /g ; then a point-value representation for C is f.x 0 ; y 0 y 0 0 /; .x 1 ; y 1 y 0 1 /; : : : ; .x 2n1 ; y 2n1 y 0 2n1 /g : Given two input polynomials in extended point-value form, multiplying them to obtain the point-value form of the result takes just ‚.n/ time, much less than the ‚.n 2 / time required to multiply polynomials in coefûcient form. Finally, let’s consider how to evaluate a polynomial given in point-value form at a new point. For this problem, the simplest approach known is to ûrst convert the polynomial to coefûcient form and then evaluate it at the new point. Fast multiplication of polynomials in coefûcient form Can the linear-time multiplication method for polynomials in point-value form expedite polynomial multiplication in coefûcient form? The answer hinges on 30.1 Representing polynomials 883 a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 b 0 ; b 1 ; : : : ; b n1 c 0 ; c ; : : : ; c 2n2 Ordinary multiplication Time ‚.n 2 / Evaluation Time ‚.n lg n/ Time ‚.n lg n/ Interpolation Pointwise multiplication Time ‚.n/ A.! 0 2n /; B.! 0 2n / A.! 1 2n /; B.! 1 2n / A.! 2n1 2n /; B.! 2n1 2n / : : : : : : C.! 0 2n / C.! 1 2n / C.! 2n1 2n / Coefûcient Point-value representations representations Figure 30.1 A graphical outline of an efûcient polynomial-multiplication process. Representations on the top are in coefûcient form, and those on the bottom are in point-value form. The arrows from left to right correspond to the multiplication operation. The ! 2n terms are complex .2n/th roots of unity. whether it is possible convert a polynomial quickly from coefûcient form to point- value form (evaluate) and vice versa (interpolate). Any points can serve as evaluation points, but certain evaluation points allow conversion between representations in only ‚.n lg n/ time. As we’ll see in Sec- tion 30.2, if <complex roots of unity= are the evaluation points, then the dis- crete Fourier transform (or DFT) evaluates and the inverse DFT interpolates. Sec- tion 30.2 shows how the FFT accomplishes the DFT and inverse DFT operations in ‚.n lg n/ time. Figure 30.1 shows this strategy graphically. One minor detail concerns degree- bounds. The product of two polynomials of degree-bound n is a polynomial of degree-bound 2n. Before evaluating the input polynomials A and B , therefore, ûrst double their degree-bounds to 2n by adding n high-order coefûcients of 0. Because the vectors have 2n elements, use <complex .2n/th roots of unity,= which are denoted by the ! 2n terms in Figure 30.1. The following procedure takes advantage of the FFT to multiply two polyno- mials A.x/ and B.x/ of degree-bound n in ‚.n lg n/-time, where the input and output representations are in coefûcient form. The procedure assumes that n is an exact power of 2, so if it isn’t, just add high-order zero coefûcients. 1. Double degree-bound: Create coefûcient representations of A.x/ and B.x/ as degree-bound 2n polynomials by adding n high-order zero coefûcients to each. 884 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT 2. Evaluate: Compute point-value representations of A.x/ and B.x/ of length 2n by applying the FFT of order 2n on each polynomial. These representations contain the values of the two polynomials at the .2n/th roots of unity. 3. Pointwise multiply: Compute a point-value representation for the polynomial C.x/ D A.x/B.x/ by multiplying these values together pointwise. This repre- sentation contains the value of C.x/ at each .2n/th root of unity. 4. Interpolate: Create the coefûcient representation of the polynomial C.x/ by applying the FFT on 2n point-value pairs to compute the inverse DFT. Steps (1) and (3) take ‚.n/ time, and steps (2) and (4) take ‚.n lg n/ time. Thus, once we show how to use the FFT, we will have proven the following. Theorem 30.2 Two polynomials of degree-bound n with both the input and output representations in coefûcient form can be multiplied in ‚.n lg n/ time. Exercises 30.1-1 Multiply the polynomials A.x/ D 7x 3  x 2 C x  10 and B.x/ D 8x 3  6x C 3 using equations (30.1) and (30.2). 30.1-2 Another way to evaluate a polynomial A.x/ of degree-bound n at a given point x 0 is to divide A.x/ by the polynomial .x  x 0 /, obtaining a quotient polynomial q.x/ of degree-bound n  1 and a remainder r , such that A.x/ D q.x/.x  x 0 / C r : Then we have A.x 0 / D r . Show how to compute the remainder r and the coefû- cients of q.x/ from x 0 and the coefûcients of A in ‚.n/ time. 30.1-3 Given a polynomial A.x/ D P n1 j D0 a j x j , deûne A rev .x/ D P n1 j D0 a n1j x j . Show how to derive a point-value representation for A rev .x/ from a point-value represen- tation for A.x/, assuming that none of the points is 0. 30.1-4 Prove that n distinct point-value pairs are necessary to uniquely specify a polyno- mial of degree-bound n, that is, if fewer than n distinct point-value pairs are given, they fail to specify a unique polynomial of degree-bound n. (Hint: Using Theo- rem 30.1, what can you say about a set of n  1 point-value pairs to which you add one more arbitrarily chosen point-value pair?) 30.2 The DFT and FFT 885 30.1-5 Show how to use equation (30.5) to interpolate in ‚.n 2 / time. (Hint: First compute the coefûcient representation of the polynomial Q j .x  x j / and then divide by .x  x k / as necessary for the numerator of each term (see Exercise 30.1-2). You can compute each of the n denominators in O.n/ time.) 30.1-6 Explain what is wrong with the <obvious= approach to polynomial division using a point-value representation: dividing the corresponding y values. Discuss sepa- rately the case in which the division comes out exactly and the case in which it doesn’t. 30.1-7 Consider two sets A and B , each having n integers in the range from 0 to 10n. The Cartesian sum of A and B is deûned by C D fx C y W x 2 A and y 2 B g : The integers in C lie in the range from 0 to 20n. Show how, in O.n lg n/ time, to ûnd the elements of C and the number of times each element of C is realized as a sum of elements in A and B . (Hint: Represent A and B as polynomials of degree at most 10n.) 30.2 The DFT and FFT In Section 30.1, we claimed that by computing the DFT and its inverse by using the FFT, it is possible to evaluate and interpolate a degree n polynomial at the complex roots of unity in ‚.n lg n/ time. This section deûnes complex roots of unity, studies their properties, deûnes the DFT, and then shows how the FFT computes the DFT and its inverse in ‚.n lg n/ time. Complex roots of unity A complex nth root of unity is a complex number ! such that ! n D 1 : There are exactly n complex nth roots of unity: e 2 i k=n for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. To interpret this formula, use the deûnition of the exponential of a complex number: e i u D cos.u/ C i sin.u/ : Figure 30.2 shows that the n complex roots of unity are equally spaced around the circle of unit radius centered at the origin of the complex plane. The value 886 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT 1 1 i i ! 0 8 D ! 8 8 ! 1 8 ! 2 8 ! 3 8 ! 4 8 ! 5 8 ! 6 8 ! 7 8 Figure 30.2 The values of ! 0 8 ; ! 1 8 ; : : : ; ! 7 8 in the complex plane, where ! 8 D e 2 i=8 is the prin- cipal 8th root of unity. ! n D e 2 i=n (30.6) is the principal nth root of unity. 2 All other complex nth roots of unity are powers of ! n . The n complex nth roots of unity, ! 0 n ; ! 1 n ; : : : ; ! n1 n ; form a group under multiplication (see Section 31.3). This group has the same structure as the additive group .Z n ; C/ modulo n, since ! n n D ! 0 n D 1 implies that ! j n ! k n D ! j Ck n D ! .j Ck/ mod n n . Similarly, ! 1 n D ! n1 n . The following lemmas furnish some essential properties of the complex nth roots of unity. Lemma 30.3 (Cancellation lemma) For any integers n > 0, k  0, and d > 0, ! d k d n D ! k n : (30.7) Proof The lemma follows directly from equation (30.6), since ! d k d n D ã e 2 i=d n ä d k D ã e 2 i=n ä k D ! k n : 2 Many other authors deûne ! n differently: ! n D e 2 i=n . This alternative deûnition tends to be used for signal-processing applications. The underlying mathematics is substantially the same with either deûnition of ! n . 30.2 The DFT and FFT 887 Corollary 30.4 For any even integer n > 0, ! n=2 n D ! 2 D 1 : Proof The proof is left as Exercise 30.2-1. Lemma 30.5 (Halving lemma) If n > 0 is even, then the squares of the n complex nth roots of unity are the n=2 complex .n=2/th roots of unity. Proof By the cancellation lemma, .! k n / 2 D ! k n=2 for any nonnegative integer k. Squaring all of the complex nth roots of unity produces each .n=2/th root of unity exactly twice, since .! kCn=2 n / 2 D ! 2kCn n D ! 2k n ! n n D ! 2k n D .! k n / 2 : Thus ! k n and ! kCn=2 n have the same square. We could also have used Corollary 30.4 to prove this property, since ! n=2 n D 1 implies ! kCn=2 n D ! k n ! n=2 n D ! k n , and thus .! kCn=2 n / 2 D .! k n / 2 D .! k n / 2 . As we’ll see, the halving lemma is essential to the divide-and-conquer approach for converting between coefûcient and point-value representations of polynomials, since it guarantees that the recursive subproblems are only half as large. Lemma 30.6 (Summation lemma) For any integer n  1 and nonzero integer k not divisible by n, n1 X j D0 ã ! k n ä j D 0 : Proof Equation (A.6) on page 1142 applies to complex values as well as to reals, giving 888 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT n1 X j D0 ã ! k n ä j D .! k n / n  1 ! k n  1 D .! n n / k  1 ! k n  1 D .1/ k  1 ! k n  1 D 0 : To see that the denominator is not 0, note that ! k n D 1 only when k is divisible by n, which the lemma statement prohibits. The DFT Recall the goal of evaluating a polynomial A.x/ D n1 X j D0 a j x j of degree-bound n at ! 0 n ; ! 1 n ; ! 2 n ; : : : ; ! n1 n (that is, at the n complex nth roots of unity). 3 The polynomial A is given in coefûcient form: a D .a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 /. Let us deûne the results y k , for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, by y k D A.! k n / D n1 X j D0 a j ! kj n : (30.8) The vector y D .y 0 ; y 1 ; : : : ; y n1 / is the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the coefûcient vector a D .a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 /. We also write y D DFT n .a/. The FFT The fast Fourier transform (FFT) takes advantage of the special properties of the complex roots of unity to compute DFT n .a/ in ‚.n lg n/ time, as opposed to the ‚.n 2 / time of the straightforward method. Assume throughout that n is an exact power of 2. Although strategies for dealing with sizes that are not exact powers of 2 are known, they are beyond the scope of this book. 3 The length n is actually what Section 30.1 referred to as 2n, since the degree-bound of the given polynomials doubles prior to evaluation. In the context of polynomial multiplication, therefore, we are actually working with complex .2n/th roots of unity. 30.2 The DFT and FFT 889 The FFT method employs a divide-and-conquer strategy, using the even-indexed and odd-indexed coefûcients of A.x/ separately to deûne the two new polynomials A even .x/ and A odd .x/ of degree-bound n=2: A even .x/ D a 0 C a 2 x C a 4 x 2 C    C a n2 x n=21 ; A odd .x/ D a 1 C a 3 x C a 5 x 2 C    C a n1 x n=21 : Note that A even contains all the even-indexed coefûcients of A (the binary repre- sentation of the index ends in 0) and A odd contains all the odd-indexed coefûcients (the binary representation of the index ends in 1). It follows that A.x/ D A even .x 2 / C xA odd .x 2 / ; (30.9) so that the problem of evaluating A.x/ at ! 0 n ; ! 1 n ; : : : ; ! n1 n reduces to 1. evaluating the degree-bound n=2 polynomials A even .x/ and A odd .x/ at the points .! 0 n / 2 ; .! 1 n / 2 ; : : : ; .! n1 n / 2 ; (30.10) and then 2. combining the results according to equation (30.9). By the halving lemma, the list of values (30.10) consists not of n distinct values but only of the n=2 complex .n=2/th roots of unity, with each root occurring exactly twice. Therefore, the FFT recursively evaluates the polynomials A even and A odd of degree-bound n=2 at the n=2 complex .n=2/th roots of unity. These subproblems have exactly the same form as the original problem, but are half the size, dividing an n-element DFT n computation into two n=2-element DFT n=2 computations. This decomposition is the basis for the FFT procedure on the next page, which computes the DFT of an n-element vector a D .a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 /, where n is an exact power of 2. The FFT procedure works as follows. Lines 132 represent the base case of the recursion. The DFT of 1 element is the element itself, since in this case y 0 D a 0 ! 0 1 D a 0  1 D a 0 : Lines 536 deûne the coefûcient vectors for the polynomials A even and A odd . Lines 3, 4, and 12 guarantee that ! is updated properly so that whenever lines 10311 are executed, ! D ! k n .

For y n=2 ; y n=2C1 ; : : : ; y n1 , letting k D 0; 1; : : : ; n=2  1, line 11 yields 4 The downside of iteratively updating ! is that round-off errors can accumulate, especially for larger input sizes. Several techniques to limit the magnitude of FFT round-off errors have been proposed, but are beyond the scope of this book. If several FFTs are going to be run on inputs of the same size, then it might be worthwhile to directly precompute a table of all n=2 values of ! k n . 30.2 The DFT and FFT 891 kC.n=2/ D y even k  ! k n y odd k D y even k C ! kC.n=2/ n y odd k (since ! kC.n=2/ n D ! k n ) D A even .! 2k n / C ! kC.n=2/ n A odd .! 2k n / D A even .! 2kCn n / C ! kC.n=2/ n A odd .! 2kCn n / (since ! 2kCn n D ! 2k n ) D A.! kC.n=2/ n / (by equation (30.9)) . Thus the vector y returned by FFT is indeed the DFT of the input vector a. Lines 10 and 11 multiply each value y odd k by ! k n , for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n=2  1. Line 10 adds this product to y even k , and line 11 subtracts it. Because each factor ! k n appears in both its positive and negative forms, we call the factors ! k n twiddle factors. To determine the running time of the procedure FFT, note that exclusive of the recursive calls, each invocation takes ‚.n/ time, where n is the length of the input vector. The recurrence for the running time is therefore T .n/ D 2T .n=2/ C ‚.n/ D ‚.n lg n/ ; by case 2 of the master theorem (Theorem 4.1). Thus the FFT can evaluate a polynomial of degree-bound n at the complex nth roots of unity in ‚.n lg n/ time. Interpolation at the complex roots of unity The polynomial multiplication scheme entails converting from coefûcient form to point-value form by evaluating the polynomial at the complex roots of unity, point- wise multiplying, and ûnally converting from point-value form back to coefûcient form by interpolating. We’ve just seen how to evaluate, so now we’ll see how to interpolate the complex roots of unity by a polynomial. To interpolate, we’ll write the DFT as a matrix equation and then look at the form of the matrix inverse. From equation (30.4), we can write the DFT as the matrix product y D V n a, where V n is a Vandermonde matrix containing the appropriate powers of ! n : ä y 0 y 1 y 2 y 3 : : : y n1 å D ä 1 1 1 1    1 1 ! n ! 2 n ! 3 n    ! n1 n 1 ! 2 n ! 4 n ! 6 n    ! 2.n1/ n 1 ! 3 n ! 6 n ! 9 n    ! 3.n1/ n : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 1 ! n1 n ! 2.n1/ n ! 3.n1/ n    ! .n1/.n1/ n åä a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 : : : a n1 å : The .k; j / entry of V n is ! kj n , for j; k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. The exponents of the entries of V n form a multiplication table for factors 0 to n  1. 892 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT For the inverse operation, which we write as a D DFT 1 n .y/, multiply y by the matrix V 1 n , the inverse of V n . Theorem 30.7 For j; k D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, the .j; k/ entry of V 1 n is ! jk n =n. Proof We show that V 1 n V n D I n , the n  n identity matrix. Consider the .k; k 0 / entry of V 1 n V n : ŒV 1 n V n � kk 0 D n1 X j D0 .! jk n =n/.! jk 0 n / D n1 X j D0 ! j.k 0 k/ n =n : This summation equals 1 if k 0 D k, and it is 0 otherwise by the summation lemma (Lemma 30.6). Note that in order for the summation lemma to apply, k 0  k must not be divisible by n. Indeed, it is not, since .n  1/ හ k 0  k හ n  1. With the inverse matrix V 1 n deûned, DFT 1 n .y/ is given by a j D n1 X kD0 y k ! jk n D 1 n n1 X kD0 y k ! kj n (30.11) for j D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1. By comparing equations (30.8) and (30.11), you can see that if you modify the FFT algorithm to switch the roles of a and y , replace ! n by ! 1 n , and divide each element of the result by n, you get the inverse DFT (see Exercise 30.2-4). Thus, DFT 1 n is computable in ‚.n lg n/ time as well. Thus, the FFT and the inverse FFT provide a way to transform a polynomial of degree-bound n back and forth between its coefûcient representation and a point- value representation in only ‚.n lg n/ time. In the context of polynomial multi- plication, we have shown the following about the convolution a ˝ b of vectors a and b: Theorem 30.8 (Convolution theorem) For any two vectors a and b of length n, where n is an exact power of 2, a ˝ b D DFT 1 2n .DFT 2n .a/  DFT 2n .b// ; where the vectors a and b are padded with 0s to length 2n and  denotes the com- ponentwise product of two 2n-element vectors. 30.2 The DFT and FFT 893 Exercises 30.2-1 Prove Corollary 30.4. 30.2-2 Compute the DFT of the vector .0; 1; 2; 3/. 30.2-3 Do Exercise 30.1-1 by using the ‚.n lg n/-time scheme. 30.2-4 Write pseudocode to compute DFT 1 n in ‚.n lg n/ time. 30.2-5 Describe the generalization of the FFT procedure to the case in which n is an exact power of 3. Give a recurrence for the running time, and solve the recurrence. ? 30.2-6 Instead of performing an n-element FFT over the ûeld of complex numbers (where n is an exact power of 2), let’s use the ring Z m of integers modulo m, where m D 2 t n=2 C 1 and t is an arbitrary positive integer. We can use ! D 2 t instead of ! n as a principal nth root of unity, modulo m. Prove that the DFT and the inverse DFT are well deûned in this system. 30.2-7 Given a list of values ´ 0 ; ´ 1 ; : : : ; ´ n1 (possibly with repetitions), show how to ûnd the coefûcients of a polynomial P .x/ of degree-bound n C 1 that has zeros only at ´ 0 ; ´ 1 ; : : : ; ´ n1 (possibly with repetitions).

The FFT’s divide-and- conquer structure enables the circuit to have a parallel structure so that the depth of the circuit4the maximum number of computational elements between any output and any input that can reach it4is ‚.lg n/. Moreover, the structure of the FFT circuit has several interesting mathematical properties, which we won’t go into here. Butterüy operations Notice that the for loop of lines 9312 of the FFT procedure computes the value ! k n y odd k twice per iteration: once in line 10 and once in line 11. A good optimizing compiler produces code that evaluates this common subexpression just once, stor- ing its value into a temporary variable, so that lines 10311 are treated like the three lines t D ! y odd k y k D y even k C t y kC.n=2/ D y even k  t This operation, multiplying the twiddle factor ! D ! k n by y odd k , storing the product into the temporary variable t , and adding and subtracting t from y even k , is known as a butterüy operation. Figure 30.3 shows it as a circuit, and you can see how it vaguely resembles the shape of a butterüy. (Although less colorfully, it could have been called a <bowtie= operation.) + – • (a) (b) y even k y even k y odd k y odd k ! k n ! k n y even k C ! k n y odd k y even k C ! k n y odd k y even k  ! k n y odd k y even k  ! k n y odd k Figure 30.3 A circuit for a butterüy operation.

Inputs enter from the left, and outputs exit from the right. The input values ûrst go through two FFT n=2 circuits, and then n=2 butterüy circuits combine the results. Only the top and bottom wires entering a butterüy interact with it: wires that pass through the middle of a butterüy do not affect that butterüy, nor are their values changed by that butterüy. Recursive circuit structure The FFT procedure follows the divide-and-conquer strategy that we ûrst saw in Section 2.3.1: Divide the n-element input vector into its n=2 even-indexed and n=2 odd-indexed elements. Conquer by recursively computing the DFTs of the two subproblems, each of size n=2. Combine by performing n=2 butterüy operations. These butterüy operations work with twiddle factors ! 0 n ; ! 1 n ; : : : ; ! n=21 n . The circuit schema in Figure 30.4 follows the conquer and combine steps of this pattern for an FFT circuit with n inputs and n outputs, denoted by FFT n . Each line is a wire that carries a value. Inputs enter from the left, one per wire, and outputs exit from the right. The conquer step runs the inputs through two FFT n=2 circuits, which are also constructed recursively. The values produced by the two FFT n=2 circuits feed into n=2 butterüy circuits, with twiddle factors ! 0 n ; ! 1 n ; : : : ; ! n=2 n  1, 896 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT (a 0 ,a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,a 4 ,a 5 ,a 6 ,a 7 ) (a 0 ,a 2 ,a 4 ,a 6 ) (a 0 ,a 4 ) (a 2 ,a 6 ) (a 0 ) (a 4 ) (a 2 ) (a 6 ) (a 1 ,a 3 ,a 5 ,a 7 ) (a 1 ,a 5 ) (a 1 ) (a 5 ) (a 3 ,a 7 ) (a 3 ) (a 7 ) Figure 30.5 The tree of input vectors to the recursive calls of the FFT procedure. The initial invocation is for n D 8. to combine the results. The base case of the recursion occurs when n D 1, where the sole output value equals the sole input value. An FFT 1 circuit, therefore, does nothing, and so the smallest nontrivial FFT circuit is FFT 2 , a single butterüy oper- ation whose twiddle factor is ! 0 2 D 1. Permuting the inputs How does the divide step enter into the circuit design? Let’s examine how input vectors to the various recursive calls of the FFT procedure relate to the original input vector, so that the circuit can emulate the divide step at the start for all levels of recursion. Figure 30.5 arranges the input vectors to the recursive calls in an invocation of FFT in a tree structure, where the initial call is for n D 8. The tree has one node for each call of the procedure, labeled by the elements of the initial call as they appear in the corresponding input vector. Each FFT invocation makes two recursive calls, unless it has received a 1-element vector. The ûrst call appears in the left child, and the second call appears in the right child. Looking at the tree, observe that if you arrange the elements of the initial vector a into the order in which they appear in the leaves, you can trace the execution of the FFT procedure, but bottom up instead of top down. First, take the elements in pairs, compute the DFT of each pair using one butterüy operation, and replace the pair with its DFT. The vector then holds n=2 two-element DFTs. Next, take these n=2 DFTs in pairs and compute the DFT of the four vector elements they come from by executing two butterüy operations, replacing two two-element DFTs with one four-element DFT. The vector then holds n=4 four-element DFTs. Continue in this manner until the vector holds two .n=2/-element DFTs, which n=2 butterüy operations combine into the ûnal n-element DFT. In other words, you can start with the elements of the initial vector a, but rearranged as in the leaves of Figure 30.5, and then feed them directly into a circuit that follows the schema in Figure 30.4. 30.3 FFT circuits 897 Let’s think about the permutation that rearranges the input vector. The order in which the leaves appear in Figure 30.5 is a bit-reversal permutation. That is, letting rev.k/ be the lg n-bit integer formed by reversing the bits of the bi- nary representation of k, then vector element a k moves to position rev.k/. In Figure 30.5, for example, the leaves appear in the order 0; 4; 2; 6; 1; 5; 3; 7. This sequence in binary is 000; 100; 010; 110; 001; 101; 011; 111, and you can obtain it by reversing the bits of each number in the sequence 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 6; 7 or, in bi- nary, 000; 001; 010; 011; 100; 101; 110; 111. To see in general that the input vector should be rearranged by a bit-reversal permutation, note that at the top level of the tree, indices whose low-order bit is 0 go into the left subtree and indices whose low-order bit is 1 go into the right subtree. Stripping off the low-order bit at each level, continue this process down the tree, until you get the order given by the bit-reversal permutation at the leaves. The full FFT circuit Figure 30.6 depicts the entire circuit for n D 8. The circuit begins with a bit- reversal permutation of the inputs, followed by lg n stages, each stage consisting of n=2 butterüies executed in parallel. Assuming that each butterüy circuit has constant depth, the full circuit has depth ‚.lg n/. The butterüy operations at each level of recursion in the FFT procedure are independent, and so the circuit per- forms them in parallel. The ûgure shows wires running from left to right, carrying values through the lg n stages. For s D 1; 2; : : : ; lg n, stage s consists of n=2 s groups of butterüies, with 2 s1 butterüies per group. The twiddle factors in stage s are ! 0 m ; ! 1 m ; : : : ; ! m=21 m , where m D 2 s .

It has lg n stages, and each stage comprises n=2 butterüies that can operate in parallel. As in Figure 30.4, only the top and bottom wires entering a butterüy interact with it. For example, the top butterüy in stage 2 has inputs and outputs only on wires 0 and 2 (the wires with outputs y 0 and y 2 , respectively). This circuit has depth ‚.lg n/ and performs ‚.n lg n/ butterüy operations altogether. 30.3-4 Write pseudocode for the procedure BIT-REVERSE-PERMUTATION .a; n/, which performs the bit-reversal permutation on a vector a of length n in-place.

In addition, suppose that exactly one adder has failed, but you don’t know which one. Describe how you can identify the failed adder by supplying inputs to the overall FFT circuit and observing the outputs. How efûcient is your method?

For some problems, the answer is known to contain only integers, and a variant of the FFT based on modular arithmetic can guarantee that the answer is calculated exactly. An example of such a problem is that of multiplying two polynomials with integer coefûcients. Exercise 30.2-6 gives one approach, using a modulus of length �.n/ bits to handle a DFT on n points. This problem explores another approach that uses a modulus of the more reasonable length O.lg n/, but it requires that you understand the material of Chapter 31. Let n be an exact power of 2. a. You wish to search for the smallest k such that p D k n C 1 is prime. Give a simple heuristic argument why you might expect k to be approximately ln n. (The value of k might be much larger or smaller, but you can reasonably expect to examine O.lg n/ candidate values of k on average.) How does the expected length of p compare to the length of n?

Assume that the algorithm is given p and w. 902 Chapter 30 Polynomials and the FFT d. Compute the DFT modulo p D 17 of the vector .0; 5; 3; 7; 7; 2; 1; 6/. (Hint: Verify and use the fact that g D 3 is a generator of Z  17 .) Chapter notes Van Loan’s book [442] provides an outstanding treatment of the fast Fourier trans- form. Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery [365, 366] offer a good descrip- tion of the fast Fourier transform and its applications. For an excellent introduction to signal processing, a popular FFT application area, see the texts by Oppenheim and Schafer [347] and Oppenheim and Willsky [348]. The Oppenheim and Schafer book also shows how to handle cases in which n is not an exact power of 2. Fourier analysis is not limited to 1-dimensional data. It is widely used in image processing to analyze data in two or more dimensions. The books by Gonzalez and Woods [194] and Pratt [363] discuss multidimensional Fourier transforms and their use in image processing, and books by Tolimieri, An, and Lu [439] and Van Loan [442] discuss the mathematics of multidimensional fast Fourier transforms. Cooley and Tukey [101] are widely credited with devising the FFT in the 1960s. The FFT had in fact been discovered many times previously, but its importance was not fully realized before the advent of modern digital computers. Although Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery attribute the origins of the method to Runge and K¨ onig in 1924, an article by Heideman, Johnson, and Burrus [211] traces the history of the FFT as far back as C. F. Gauss in 1805. Frigo and Johnson [161] developed a fast and üexible implementation of the FFT, called FFTW (<fastest Fourier transform in the West=). FFTW is designed for situations requiring multiple DFT computations on the same problem size. Before actually computing the DFTs, FFTW executes a <planner,= which, by a series of trial runs, determines how best to decompose the FFT computation for the given problem size on the host machine. FFTW adapts to use the hardware cache ef- ûciently, and once subproblems are small enough, FFTW solves them with opti- mized, straight-line code. Moreover, FFTW has the advantage of taking ‚.n lg n/ time for any problem size n, even when n is a large prime. Although the standard Fourier transform assumes that the input represents points that are uniformly spaced in the time domain, other techniques can approximate the FFT on <nonequispaced= data. The article by Ware [449] provides an overview. 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms Number theory was once viewed as a beautiful but largely useless subject in pure mathematics. Today number-theoretic algorithms are used widely, due in large part to the invention of cryptographic schemes based on large prime numbers. These schemes are feasible because we can ûnd large primes quickly , and they are secure because we do not know how to factor the product of large primes (or solve related problems, such as computing discrete logarithms) efûciently. This chapter presents some of the number theory and related algorithms that underlie such applications. We start in Section 31.1 by introducing basic concepts of number theory, such as divisibility, modular equivalence, and unique prime factorization. Section 31.2 studies one of the world’s oldest algorithms: Euclid’s algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers, and Section 31.3 reviews concepts of modular arithmetic. Section 31.4 then explores the set of multiples of a given number a, modulo n, and shows how to ûnd all solutions to the equation ax D b .mod n/ by using Euclid’s algorithm. The Chinese remainder theorem is presented in Section 31.5. Section 31.6 considers powers of a given number a, modulo n, and presents a repeated-squaring algorithm for efûciently computing a b mod n, given a, b, and n. This operation is at the heart of efûcient primality testing and of much modern cryptography, such as the RSA public-key cryptosystem described in Section 31.7. We wrap up in Section 31.8, which examines a randomized primality test. This test ûnds large primes efûciently, an essential step in creating keys for the RSA cryptosystem. Size of inputs and cost of arithmetic computations Because we’ll be working with large integers, we need to adjust how to think about the size of an input and about the cost of elementary arithmetic operations. In this chapter, a <large input= typically means an input containing <large in- tegers= rather than an input containing <many integers= (as for sorting). Thus, the size of an input depends on the number of bits required to represent that in- put, not just the number of integers in the input. An algorithm with integer in- 904 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms puts a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k is a polynomial-time algorithm if it runs in time polynomial in lg a 1 ; lg a 2 ; : : : ; lg a k , that is, polynomial in the lengths of its binary-encoded inputs. Most of this book considers the elementary arithmetic operations (multiplica- tions, divisions, or computing remainders) as primitive operations that take one unit of time. Counting the number of such arithmetic operations that an algorithm per- forms provides a basis for making a reasonable estimate of the algorithm’s actual running time on a computer. Elementary operations can be time-consuming, how- ever, when their inputs are large. It thus becomes appropriate to measure how many bit operations a number-theoretic algorithm requires. In this model, multiplying two ˇ-bit integers by the ordinary method uses ‚.ˇ 2 / bit operations. Similarly, di- viding a ˇ-bit integer by a shorter integer or taking the remainder of a ˇ-bit integer when divided by a shorter integer requires ‚.ˇ 2 / time by simple algorithms. (See Exercise 31.1-12.) Faster methods are known. For example, a simple divide-and- conquer method for multiplying two ˇ-bit integers has a running time of ‚.ˇ lg 3 /, and O.ˇ lg ˇ lg lg ˇ/ time is possible. For practical purposes, however, the ‚.ˇ 2 / algorithm is often best, and we use this bound as a basis for our analyses. In this chapter, we’ll usually analyze algorithms in terms of both the number of arithmetic operations and the number of bit operations they require. 31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions This section provides a brief review of notions from elementary number theory concerning the set Z D f: : : ; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; : : : g of integers and the set N D f0; 1; 2; : : :g of natural numbers. Divisibility and divisors The notion of one integer being divisible by another is key to the theory of numbers. The notation d j a (read <d divides a=) means that a D kd for some integer k. Every integer divides 0. If a > 0 and d j a, then jd j හ jaj. If d j a, then we also say that a is a multiple of d . If d does not divide a, we write d − a. If d j a and d  0, then d is a divisor of a. Since d j a if and only if d j a, without loss of generality, we deûne the divisors of a to be nonnegative, with the understanding that the negative of any divisor of a also divides a. A divisor of a nonzero integer a is at least 1 but not greater than jaj. For example, the divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Every positive integer a is divisible by the trivial divisors 1 and a. The nontrivial divisors of a are the factors of a. For example, the factors of 20 are 2, 4, 5, and 10. 31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions 905 Prime and composite numbers An integer a > 1 whose only divisors are the trivial divisors 1 and a is a prime number or, more simply, a prime. Primes have many special properties and play a critical role in number theory. The ûrst 20 primes, in order, are 2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; 41; 43; 47; 53; 59; 61; 67; 71 : Exercise 31.1-2 asks you to prove that there are inûnitely many primes. An integer a > 1 that is not prime is a composite number or, more simply, a composite. For example, 39 is composite because 3 j 39. We call the integer 1 a unit, and it is neither prime nor composite. Similarly, the integer 0 and all negative integers are neither prime nor composite. The division theorem, remainders, and modular equivalence Given an integer n, we can partition the integers into those that are multiples of n and those that are not multiples of n. Much number theory is based upon reûning this partition by classifying the integers that are not multiples of n according to their remainders when divided by n. The following theorem provides the basis for this reûnement. We omit the proof (but see, for example, Niven and Zuckerman [345]). Theorem 31.1 (Division theorem) For any integer a and any positive integer n, there exist unique integers q and r such that 0 හ r < n and a D q n C r . The value q D ba=nc is the quotient of the division. The value r D a mod n is the remainder (or residue) of the division, so that n j a if and only if a mod n D 0. The integers partition into n equivalence classes according to their remainders modulo n. The equivalence class modulo n containing an integer a is Œa� n D fa C k n W k 2 Zg : For example, Œ3� 7 D f: : : ; 11; 4; 3; 10; 17; : : : g, and Œ4� 7 and Œ10� 7 also denote this set. With the notation deûned on page 64, writing a 2 Œb� n is the same as writing a D b .mod n/. The set of all such equivalence classes is Z n D fŒa� n W 0 හ a හ n  1g : (31.1) When you see the deûnition Z n D f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g ; (31.2) you should read it as equivalent to equation (31.1) with the understanding that 0 represents Œ0� n , 1 represents Œ1� n , and so on. Each class is represented by its 906 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms smallest nonnegative element. You should keep the underlying equivalence classes in mind, however. For example, if we refer to 1 as a member of Z n , we are really referring to Œn  1� n , since 1 D n  1 .mod n/. Common divisors and greatest common divisors If d is a divisor of a and d is also a divisor of b, then d is a common divisor of a and b. For example, the divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30, and so the common divisors of 24 and 30 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Any pair of integers has a common divisor of 1. An important property of common divisors is that if d j a and d j b, then d j .a C b/ and d j .a  b/ : (31.3) More generally, for any integers x and y , if d j a and d j b, then d j .ax C by/ : (31.4) Also, if a j b, then either jaj හ jbj or b D 0, which implies that if a j b and b j a, then a D Ûb : (31.5) The greatest common divisor of two integers a and b which are not both 0, de- noted by gcd.a; b/, is the largest of the common divisors of a and b. For example, gcd.24; 30/ D 6, gcd.5; 7/ D 1, and gcd.0; 9/ D 9. If a and b are both nonzero, then gcd.a; b/ is an integer between 1 and min fjaj; jbjg. We deûne gcd.0; 0/ to be 0, so that standard properties of the gcd function (such as equation (31.9) be- low) hold universally. Exercise 31.1-9 asks you to prove the following elementary properties of the gcd function: gcd.a; b/ D gcd.b; a/ ; (31.6) gcd.a; b/ D gcd.a; b/ ; (31.7) gcd.a; b/ D gcd.jaj; jbj/ ; (31.8) gcd.a; 0/ D jaj ; (31.9) gcd.a; ka/ D jaj for any k 2 Z : (31.10) The following theorem provides an alternative and useful way to characterize gcd.a; b/. Theorem 31.2 If a and b are any integers, not both zero, then gcd.a; b/ is the smallest positive element of the set fax C by W x; y 2 Zg of linear combinations of a and b. 31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions 907 Proof Let s be the smallest positive such linear combination of a and b, and let s D ax C by for some x; y 2 Z. Let q D ba=s c. Equation (3.11) on page 64 then implies mod s D a  qs D a  q.ax C by/ D a .1  qx/ C b .qy/ ; so that a mod s is a linear combination of a and b as well. Because s is the small- est positive such linear combination and 0 හ a mod s < s (inequality (3.12) on page 64), a mod s cannot be positive. Hence, a mod s D 0. Therefore, we have that s j a and, by analogous reasoning, s j b. Thus, s is a common divisor of a and b, so that gcd.a; b/  s . By deûnition, gcd.a; b/ divides both a and b, and s is deûned as a linear combination of a and b. Equation (31.4) therefore implies that gcd.a; b/ j s . But gcd.a; b/ j s and s > 0 imply that gcd.a; b/ හ s . Com- bining gcd.a; b/  s and gcd.a; b/ හ s yields gcd.a; b/ D s . We conclude that s , the smallest positive linear combination of a and b, is also their greatest common divisor. Theorem 31.2 engenders three useful corollaries. Corollary 31.3 For any integers a and b, if d j a and d j b, then d j gcd.a; b/. Proof This corollary follows from equation (31.4) and Theorem 31.2, because gcd.a; b/ is a linear combination of a and b, Corollary 31.4 For all integers a and b and any nonnegative integer n, we have gcd.an; bn/ D n gcd.a; b/ : Proof If n D 0, the corollary is trivial. If n > 0, then gcd.an; bn/ is the smallest positive element of the set fanx C bny W x; y 2 Zg, which in turn is n times the smallest positive element of the set fax C by W x; y 2 Zg. Corollary 31.5 For all positive integers n, a, and b, if n j ab and gcd.a; n/ D 1, then n j b. Proof Exercise 31.1-5 asks you to provide the proof. 908 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms Relatively prime integers Two integers a and b are relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1, that is, if gcd.a; b/ D 1. For example, 8 and 15 are relatively prime, since the divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The following theorem states that if two integers are each relatively prime to an integer p, then their product is relatively prime to p. Theorem 31.6 For any integers a, b, and p, we have gcd.ab; p/ D 1 if and only if gcd.a; p/ D 1 and gcd.b; p/ D 1 both hold. Proof If gcd.a; p/ D 1 and gcd.b; p/ D 1, then it follows from Theorem 31.2 that there exist integers x , y , x 0 , and y 0 such that ax C py D 1 ; bx 0 C py 0 D 1 : Multiplying these equations and rearranging gives ab.xx 0 / C p.ybx 0 C y 0 ax C pyy 0 / D 1 : Since 1 is thus a positive linear combination of ab and p, it is the smallest positive linear combination. Applying Theorem 31.2 implies gcd.ab; p/ D 1, completing the proof in this direction. Conversely, if gcd.ab; p/ D 1, then Theorem 31.2 implies that there exist inte- gers x and y such that abx C py D 1 : Writing abx as a.bx/ and applying Theorem 31.2 again proves that gcd.a; p/ D 1. Proving that gcd.b; p/ D 1 is similar. Integers n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n k are pairwise relatively prime if gcd.n i ; n j / D 1 for 1 හ i < j හ k. Unique prime factorization An elementary but important fact about divisibility by primes is the following. Theorem 31.7 For all primes p and all integers a and b, if p j ab, then p j a or p j b (or both). Proof Assume for the purpose of contradiction that p j ab, but that p − a and p − b. Because p > 1 and ab D kp for some k 2 Z, equation (31.10) gives 31.1 Elementary number-theoretic notions 909 that gcd.ab; p/ D p. We also have that gcd.a; p/ D 1 and gcd.b; p/ D 1, since the only divisors of p are 1 and p, and we assumed that p divides neither a nor b. Theorem 31.6 then implies that gcd.ab; p/ D 1, contradicting gcd.ab; p/ D p. This contradiction completes the proof. A consequence of Theorem 31.7 is that any composite integer can be uniquely factored into a product of primes. Exercise 31.1-11 asks you to provide a proof. Theorem 31.8 (Unique prime factorization) There is exactly one way to write any composite integer a as a product of the form a D p e 1 1 p e 2 2    p e r r ; where the p i are prime, p 1 < p 2 <    < p r , and the e i are positive integers. As an example, the unique prime factorization of the number 6000 is 2 4  3 1  5 3 . Exercises 31.1-1 Prove that if a > b > 0 and c D a C b, then c mod a D b. 31.1-2 Prove that there are inûnitely many primes.

Conclude that for all integers a and b and all primes p, .a C b/ p D a p C b p .mod p/ : 31.1-7 Prove that if a and b are any positive integers such that a j b, then 910 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms .x mod b/ mod a D x mod a for any x . Prove, under the same assumptions, that x D y .mod b/ implies x D y .mod a/ for any integers x and y . 31.1-8 For any integer k > 0, an integer n is a kth power if there exists an integer a such that a k D n. Furthermore, n > 1 is a nontrivial power if it is a kth power for some integer k > 1.

That is, prove that for all integers a, b, and c , we have gcd.a; gcd.b; c// D gcd.gcd.a; b/; c/ : ? 31.1-11 Prove Theorem 31.8. 31.1-12 Give efûcient algorithms for the operations of dividing a ˇ-bit integer by a shorter integer and of taking the remainder of a ˇ-bit integer when divided by a shorter integer. Your algorithms should run in ‚.ˇ 2 / time. 31.1-13 Give an efûcient algorithm to convert a given ˇ-bit (binary) integer to a decimal representation. Argue that if multiplication or division of integers whose length is at most ˇ takes M.ˇ/ time, where M.ˇ/ D �.ˇ/, then you can convert bi- nary to decimal in O.M.ˇ/ lg ˇ/ time. (Hint: Use a divide-and-conquer approach, obtaining the top and bottom halves of the result with separate recursions.) 31.1-14 Professor Marshall sets up n lightbulbs in a row.

For i D 1; 2; 3; : : : ; n, the professor presses bulb i; 2i; 3i; : : :. After the last press, which lightbulbs are on? Prove your answer. 31.2 Greatest common divisor 911 31.2 Greatest common divisor In this section, we describe Euclid’s algorithm for efûciently computing the great- est common divisor of two integers. When we analyze the running time, we’ll see a surprising connection with the Fibonacci numbers, which yield a worst-case input for Euclid’s algorithm. We restrict ourselves in this section to nonnegative integers. This restriction is justiûed by equation (31.8), which states that gcd.a; b/ D gcd.jaj; jbj/. In principle, for positive integers a and b, their prime factorizations sufûce to compute gcd.a; b/. Indeed, if a D p e 1 1 p e 2 2    p e r r ; (31.11) b D p f 1 1 p f 2 2    p f r r ; (31.12) with 0 exponents being used to make the set of primes p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p r the same for both a and b, then, as Exercise 31.2-1 asks you to show, gcd.a; b/ D p minfe 1 ;f 1 g 1 p minfe 2 ;f 2 g 2    p minfe r ;f r g r : (31.13) The best algorithms to date for factoring do not run in polynomial time. Thus, this approach to computing greatest common divisors seems unlikely to yield an efûcient algorithm. Euclid’s algorithm for computing greatest common divisors relies on the follow- ing theorem. Theorem 31.9 (GCD recursion theorem) For any nonnegative integer a and any positive integer b, gcd.a; b/ D gcd.b; a mod b/ : Proof We will show that gcd.a; b/ and gcd.b; a mod b/ divide each other. Since they are both nonnegative, equation (31.5) then implies that they must be equal. We ûrst show that gcd.a; b/ j gcd.b; a mod b/. If we let d D gcd.a; b/, then d j a and d j b. By equation (3.11) on page 64, a mod b D a  qb, where q D ba=bc. Since a mod b is thus a linear combination of a and b, equation (31.4) implies that d j .a mod b/. Therefore, since d j b and d j .a mod b/, Corol- lary 31.3 implies that d j gcd.b; a mod b/, that is, gcd.a; b/ j gcd.b; a mod b/ : (31.14) Showing that gcd.b; a mod b/ j gcd.a; b/ is almost the same. If we now let d D gcd.b; a mod b/, then d j b and d j .a mod b/. Since a D qb C .a mod b/, 912 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms where q D ba=bc, we have that a is a linear combination of b and .a mod b/. By equation (31.4), we conclude that d j a. Since d j b and d j a, we have that d j gcd.a; b/ by Corollary 31.3, so that gcd.b; a mod b/ j gcd.a; b/ : (31.15) Using equation (31.5) to combine equations (31.14) and (31.15) completes the proof. Euclid’s algorithm Euclid’s Elements (circa 300 B. C. E.) describes the following gcd algorithm, al- though its origin might be even earlier. The recursive procedure E UCLID imple- ments Euclid’s algorithm, based directly on Theorem 31.9. The inputs a and b are arbitrary nonnegative integers. EUCLID.a; b/ 1 if b == 0 2 return a 3 else return EUCLID.b; a mod b/ For example, here is how the procedure computes gcd.30; 21/: EUCLID.30; 21/ D EUCLID.21; 9/ D EUCLID.9; 3/ D EUCLID.3; 0/ D 3 : This computation calls EUCLID recursively three times. The correctness of EUCLID follows from Theorem 31.9 and the property that if the algorithm returns a in line 2, then b D 0, so that by equation (31.9), gcd.a; b/ D gcd.a; 0/ D a. The algorithm cannot recurse indeûnitely, since the second argument strictly decreases in each recursive call and is always nonnega- tive. Therefore, EUCLID always terminates with the correct answer. The running time of Euclid’s algorithm Let’s analyze the worst-case running time of EUCLID as a function of the size of a and b. The overall running time of EUCLID is proportional to the number of recursive calls it makes. The analysis assumes that a > b  0, that is, the ûrst argument is greater than the second argument. Why? If b D a > 0, then a mod b D 0 and the procedure terminates after one recursive call. If b > a  0, 31.2 Greatest common divisor 913 then the procedure makes just one more recursive call than when a > b, because in this case EUCLID.a; b/ immediately makes the recursive call E UCLID.b; a/, and now the ûrst argument is greater than the second. Our analysis relies on the Fibonacci numbers F k , deûned by the recurrence equa- tion (3.31) on page 69. Lemma 31.10 If a > b  1 and the call EUCLID.a; b/ performs k  1 recursive calls, then a  F kC2 and b  F kC1 . Proof The proof proceeds by induction on k. For the base case of the induction, let k D 1. Then, b  1 D F 2 , and since a > b, we must have a  2 D F 3 . Since b > .a mod b/, in each recursive call the ûrst argument is strictly larger than the second. The assumption that a > b therefore holds for each recursive call. Assuming inductively that the lemma holds if the procedure makes k  1 recur- sive calls, we shall prove that the lemma holds for k recursive calls. Since k > 0, we have b > 0, and EUCLID.a; b/ calls EUCLID.b; a mod b/ recursively, which in turn makes k  1 recursive calls. The inductive hypothesis then implies that b  F kC1 (thus proving part of the lemma), and a mod b  F k . We have b C .a mod b/ D b C .a  b ba=bc/ (by equation (3.11)) හ a ; since a > b > 0 implies ba=bc  1. Thus, a  b C .a mod b/  F kC1 C F k D F kC2 : The following theorem is an immediate corollary of this lemma. Theorem 31.11 (Lam´ e’s theorem) For any integer k  1, if a > b  1 and b < F kC1 , then the call EUCLID.a; b/ makes fewer than k recursive calls. To show that the upper bound of Theorem 31.11 is the best possible, we’ll show that the call EUCLID.F kC1 ; F k / makes exactly k  1 recursive calls when k  2. We use induction on k. For the base case, k D 2, and the call EUCLID.F 3 ; F 2 / makes exactly one recursive call, to EUCLID.1; 0/. (We have to start at k D 2, because when k D 1 we do not have F 2 > F 1 .) For the inductive step, as- sume that EUCLID.F k ; F k1 / makes exactly k  2 recursive calls. For k > 2, we have F k > F k1 > 0 and F kC1 D F k C F k1 , and so by Exercise 31.1-1, we 914 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms have F kC1 mod F k D F k1 . Because EUCLID.a; b/ calls EUCLID.b; a mod b/ when b > 0, the call EUCLID.F kC1 ; F k / recurses one time more than the call EUCLID.F k ; F k1 /, or exactly k  1 times, which meets the upper bound given by Theorem 31.11. Since F k is approximately � k = p 5, where � is the golden ratio .1 C p 5/=2 deûned by equation (3.32) on page 69, the number of recursive calls in EUCLID is O.lg b/. (See Exercise 31.2-5 for a tighter bound.) Therefore, a call of EUCLID on two ˇ-bit numbers performs O.ˇ/ arithmetic operations and O.ˇ 3 / bit opera- tions (assuming that multiplication and division of ˇ-bit numbers take O.ˇ 2 / bit operations). Problem 31-2 asks you to prove an O.ˇ 2 / bound on the number of bit operations. The extended form of Euclid’s algorithm By rewriting Euclid’s algorithm, we can gain additional useful information. Specif- ically, let’s extend the algorithm to compute the integer coefûcients x and y such that D gcd.a; b/ D ax C by ; (31.16) where either or both of x and y may be zero or negative. These coefûcients will prove useful later for computing modular multiplicative inverses. The procedure EXTENDED-EUCLID takes as input a pair of nonnegative integers and returns a triple of the form .d; x; y/ that satisûes equation (31.16). As an example, Fig- ure 31.1 traces out the call EXTENDED-EUCLID .99; 78/. EXTENDED-EUCLID .a; b/ 1 if b == 0 2 return .a; 1; 0/ 3 else .d 0 ; x 0 ; y 0 / D EXTENDED-EUCLID .b; a mod b/ 4 .d; x; y/ D .d 0 ; y 0 ; x 0  ba=bc y 0 / 5 return .d; x; y/ The EXTENDED-EUCLID procedure is a variation of the EUCLID procedure. Line 1 is equivalent to the test <b == 0= in line 1 of EUCLID. If b D 0, then EXTENDED-EUCLID returns not only d D a in line 2, but also the coefûcients x D 1 and y D 0, so that a D ax C by . If b ¤ 0, EXTENDED-EUCLID ûrst computes .d 0 ; x 0 ; y 0 / such that d 0 D gcd.b; a mod b/ and d 0 D bx 0 C .a mod b/y 0 : (31.17) As in the EUCLID procedure, we have d D gcd.a; b/ D d 0 D gcd.b; a mod b/. To obtain x and y such that d D ax C by , let’s rewrite equation (31.17), setting 31.2 Greatest common divisor 915 a b ba=bc d x y 99 78 1 3 11 14 78 21 3 3 3 11 21 15 1 3 2 3 15 6 2 3 1 2 6 3 2 3 0 1 3 0 4 3 1 0 Figure 31.1 How EXTENDED-EUCLID computes gcd.99; 78/. Each line shows one level of the recursion: the values of the inputs a and b, the computed value ba=bc, and the values d , x, and y returned. The triple .d; x; y/ returned becomes the triple .d 0 ; x 0 ; y 0 / used at the next higher level of recursion. The call E XTENDED-EUCLID.99; 78/ returns .3; 11; 14/, so that gcd.99; 78/ D 3 D 99  .11/ C 78  14. d D d 0 and using equation (3.11): d D bx 0 C .a  b ba=bc/y 0 D ay 0 C b.x 0  ba=bc y 0 / : Thus, choosing x D y 0 and y D x 0  ba=bc y 0 satisûes the equation d D ax C by , thereby proving the correctness of EXTENDED-EUCLID. Since the number of recursive calls made in EUCLID is equal to the number of recursive calls made in EXTENDED-EUCLID, the running times of EUCLID and EXTENDED-EUCLID are the same, to within a constant factor. That is, for a > b > 0, the number of recursive calls is O.lg b/. Exercises 31.2-1 Prove that equations (31.11) and (31.12) imply equation (31.13). 31.2-2 Compute the values .d; x; y/ that the call EXTENDED-EUCLID .899; 493/ returns. 31.2-3 Prove that for all integers a, k, and n, gcd.a; n/ D gcd.a C k n; n/ : (31.18) Use equation (31.18) to show that a D 1 .mod n/ implies gcd.a; n/ D 1. 31.2-4 Rewrite EUCLID in an iterative form that uses only a constant amount of memory (that is, stores only a constant number of integer values). 916 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms 31.2-5 If a > b  0, show that the call EUCLID.a; b/ makes at most 1 C log  b recursive calls. Improve this bound to 1 C log  .b= gcd.a; b//. 31.2-6 What does EXTENDED-EUCLID .F kC1 ; F k / return?

This informal model sufûces if you stick to the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A more formal model for modular arithmetic, which follows, is best described within the framework of group theory. 31.3 Modular arithmetic 917 Finite groups A group .S; Ü/ is a set S together with a binary operation Ü deûned on S for which the following properties hold: 1. Closure: For all a; b 2 S , we have a Ü b 2 S . 2. Identity: There exists an element e 2 S , called the identity of the group, such that e Ü a D a Ü e D a for all a 2 S . 3. Associativity: For all a; b; c 2 S , we have .a Ü b/ Ü c D a Ü .b Ü c/. 4. Inverses: For each a 2 S , there exists a unique element b 2 S , called the inverse of a, such that a Ü b D b Ü a D e. As an example, consider the familiar group .Z; C/ of the integers Z under the operation of addition: 0 is the identity, and the inverse of a is a. An abelian group .S; Ü/ satisûes the commutative law a Ü b D b Ü a for all a; b 2 S . The size of group .S; Ü/ is jS j, and if jS j < 1, then .S; Ü/ is a ûnite group. The groups deûned by modular addition and multiplication We can form two ûnite abelian groups by using addition and multiplication mod- ulo n, where n is a positive integer. These groups are based on the equivalence classes of the integers modulo n, deûned in Section 31.1. To deûne a group on Z n , we need suitable binary operations, which we obtain by redeûning the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication. We can deûne addition and multiplication operations for Z n , because the equivalence class of two integers uniquely determines the equivalence class of their sum or product. That is, if a D a 0 .mod n/ and b D b 0 .mod n/, then a C b D a 0 C b 0 .mod n/ ; ab D a 0 b 0 .mod n/ : Thus, we deûne addition and multiplication modulo n, denoted C n and  n , by Œa� n C n Œb� n D Œa C b� n ; (31.19) Œa� n  n Œb� n D Œab� n : (We can deûne subtraction similarly on Z n by Œa� n  n Œb� n D Œa  b� n , but di- vision is more complicated, as we’ll see.) These facts justify the common and convenient practice of using the smallest nonnegative element of each equivalence class as its representative when performing computations in Z n . We add, subtract, and multiply as usual on the representatives, but we replace each result x by the representative of its class, that is, by x mod n. 918 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 (a) 1 2 4 7 8 11 13 14 1 2 7 8 11 13 14 1 2 4 7 8 11 13 14 2 4 8 14 1 7 11 13 4 8 1 13 2 14 7 11 7 14 13 4 11 2 1 8 8 1 2 11 4 13 14 7 11 7 14 2 13 1 8 4 13 11 7 1 14 8 4 2 14 13 11 8 7 4 2 1 (b) + 6 · 15 Figure 31.2 Two ûnite groups. Equivalence classes are denoted by their representative elements. (a) The group .Z 6 ; C 6 /. (b) The group .Z  15 ;  15 /. Using this deûnition of addition modulo n, we deûne the additive group modulo n as .Z n ; C n /. The size of the additive group modulo n is jZ n j D n. Figure 31.2(a) gives the operation table for the group .Z 6 ; C 6 /. Theorem 31.12 The system .Z n ; C n / is a ûnite abelian group. Proof Equation (31.19) shows that .Z n ; C n / is closed. Associativity and com- mutativity of C n follow from the associativity and commutativity of C: .Œa� n C n Œb� n / C n Œc� n D Œa C b� n C n Œc� n D Œ.a C b/ C c� n D Œa C .b C c/� n D Œa� n C n Œb C c� n D Œa� n C n .Œb� n C n Œc� n / ; Œa� n C n Œb� n D Œa C b� n D Œb C a� n D Œb� n C n Œa� n : The identity element of .Z n ; C n / is 0 (that is, Œ0� n ). The (additive) inverse of an element a (that is, of Œa� n ) is the element a (that is, Œa� n or Œn  a� n ), since Œa� n C n Œa� n D Œa  a� n D Œ0� n . 31.3 Modular arithmetic 919 Using the deûnition of multiplication modulo n, we deûne the multiplicative group modulo n as .Z  n ;  n /. The elements of this group are the set Z  n of elements in Z n that are relatively prime to n, so that each one has a unique inverse, modulo n: Z  n D fŒa� n 2 Z n W gcd.a; n/ D 1g : To see that Z  n is well deûned, note that for 0 හ a < n, we have a D .a C k n/ .mod n/ for all integers k. By Exercise 31.2-3, therefore, gcd.a; n/ D 1 implies gcd.a C k n; n/ D 1 for all integers k. Since Œa� n D fa C k n W k 2 Zg, the set Z  n is well deûned. An example of such a group is Z  15 D f1; 2; 4; 7; 8; 11; 13; 14g ; where the group operation is multiplication modulo 15. (We have denoted an ele- ment Œa� 15 as a, and thus, for example, we denote Œ7� 15 as 7.) Figure 31.2(b) shows the group .Z  15 ;  15 /. For example, 8  11 D 13 . mod 15/, working in Z  15 . The identity for this group is 1. Theorem 31.13 The system .Z  n ;  n / is a ûnite abelian group. Proof Theorem 31.6 implies that .Z  n ;  n / is closed. Associativity and commu- tativity can be proved for  n as they were for C n in the proof of Theorem 31.12. The identity element is Œ1� n . To show the existence of inverses, let a be an element of Z  n and let .d; x; y/ be returned by EXTENDED-EUCLID .a; n/. Then we have d D 1, since a 2 Z  n , and ax C ny D 1 ; (31.20) or equivalently, ax D 1 .mod n/ : Thus Œx� n is a multiplicative inverse of Œa� n , modulo n. Furthermore, we claim that Œx� n 2 Z  n . To see why, equation (31.20) demonstrates that the smallest pos- itive linear combination of x and n must be 1. Therefore, Theorem 31.2 implies that gcd.x; n/ D 1. We defer the proof that inverses are uniquely deûned until Corollary 31.26 in Section 31.4. As an example of computing multiplicative inverses, suppose that a D 5 and n D 11. Then EXTENDED-EUCLID .a; n/ returns .d; x; y/ D .1; 2; 1/, so that 1 D 5  .2/ C 11  1. Thus, Œ2� 11 (i.e., Œ9� 11 ) is the multiplicative inverse of Œ5� 11 . When working with the groups .Z n ; C n / and .Z  n ;  n / in the remainder of this chapter, we follow the convenient practice of denoting equivalence classes by their representative elements and denoting the operations C n and  n by the usual 920 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms arithmetic notations C and  (or juxtaposition, so that ab D a  b) respectively. Furthermore, equivalences modulo n may also be interpreted as equations in Z n . For example, the following two statements are equivalent: ax D b .mod n/ and Œa� n  n Œx� n D Œb� n : As a further convenience, we sometimes refer to a group .S; Ü/ merely as S when the operation Ü is understood from context. We may thus refer to the groups .Z n ; C n / and .Z  n ;  n / as just Z n and Z  n , respectively. We denote the (multiplicative) inverse of an element a by .a 1 mod n/. Division in Z  n is deûned by the equation a=b D ab 1 .mod n/. For example, in Z  15 we have that 7 1 D 13 . mod 15/, since 7  13 D 91 D 1 .mod 15/, so that 2=7 D 2  13 D 11 . mod 15/. The size of Z  n is denoted �.n/. This function, known as Euler’s phi function, satisûes the equation �.n/ D n Y p prime such that p j n Î 1  1 p Ï ; (31.21) so that p runs over all the primes dividing n (including n itself, if n is prime). We won’t prove this formula here. Intuitively, begin with a list of the n remainders f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g and then, for each prime p that divides n, cross out every multiple of p in the list. For example, since the prime divisors of 45 are 3 and 5, �.45/ D 45 Î 1  1 3 Ï Î 1  1 5 Ï D 45 Î 2 3 Ï Î 4 5 Ï D 24 : If p is prime, then Z  p D f1; 2; : : : ; p  1g, and �.p/ D p Î 1  1 p Ï D p  1 : (31.22) If n is composite, then �.n/ < n  1, although it can be shown that �.n/ > n e  ln ln n C 3= ln ln n (31.23) 31.3 Modular arithmetic 921 for n  3, where � D 0:5772156649 : : : is Euler’s constant. A somewhat simpler (but looser) lower bound for n > 5 is �.n/ > n 6 ln ln n : (31.24) The lower bound (31.23) is essentially the best possible, since lim inf n!1 �.n/ n= ln ln n D e  : (31.25) Subgroups If .S; Ü/ is a group, S 0 ෂ S , and .S 0 ; Ü/ is also a group, then .S 0 ; Ü/ is a sub- group of .S; Ü/. For example, the even integers form a subgroup of the integers under the operation of addition. The following theorem, whose proof we leave as Exercise 31.3-3, provides a useful tool for recognizing subgroups. Theorem 31.14 (A nonempty closed subset of a ûnite group is a subgroup) If .S; Ü/ is a ûnite group and S 0 is any nonempty subset of S such that a Ü b 2 S 0 for all a; b 2 S 0 , then .S 0 ; Ü/ is a subgroup of .S; Ü/. For example, the set f0; 2; 4; 6g forms a subgroup of Z 8 , since it is nonempty and closed under the operation C (that is, it is closed under C 8 ). The following theorem, whose proof is omitted, provides an extremely useful constraint on the size of a subgroup. Theorem 31.15 (Lagrange’s theorem) If .S; Ü/ is a ûnite group and .S 0 ; Ü/ is a subgroup of .S; Ü/, then jS 0 j is a divisor of jS j. A subgroup S 0 of a group S is a proper subgroup if S 0 ¤ S . We’ll use the following corollary in the analysis in Section 31.8 of the Miller-Rabin primality test procedure. Corollary 31.16 If S 0 is a proper subgroup of a ûnite group S , then jS 0 j හ jS j=2. Subgroups generated by an element Theorem 31.14 affords us a straightforward way to produce a subgroup of a ûnite group .S; Ü/: choose an element a and take all elements that can be generated from a using the group operation. Speciûcally, deûne a .k/ for k  1 by 922 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms a .k/ D k M i D1 a D a Ü a Ü    Ü a › k : For example, taking a D 2 in the group Z 6 yields the sequence a .1/ ; a .2/ ; a .3/ ; : : : D 2; 4; 0; 2; 4; 0; 2; 4; 0; : : : : We have a .k/ D ka mod n in the group Z n , and a .k/ D a k mod n in the group Z  n . We deûne the subgroup generated by a, denoted hai or .hai; Ü/, by hai D ˚ a .k/ W k  1  : We say that a generates the subgroup hai or that a is a generator of hai. Since S is ûnite, hai is a ûnite subset of S , possibly including all of S . Since the associativity of Ü implies a .i / Ü a .j / D a .i Cj / ; hai is closed and therefore, by Theorem 31.14, hai is a subgroup of S . For example, in Z 6 , we have h0i D f0g ; h1i D f0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5g ; h2i D f0; 2; 4g : Similarly, in Z  7 , we have h1i D f1g ; h2i D f1; 2; 4g ; h3i D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g : The order of a (in the group S ), denoted ord.a/, is deûned as the smallest posi- tive integer t such that a .t / D e. (Recall that e 2 S is the group identity.) Theorem 31.17 For any ûnite group .S; Ü/ and any a 2 S , the order of a is equal to the size of the subgroup it generates, or ord.a/ D jhaij. Proof Let t D ord.a/. Since a .t / D e and a .t Ck/ D a .t / Ü a .k/ D a .k/ for k  1, if i > t , then a .i / D a .j / for some j < i . Therefore, as we generate elements by a, we see no new elements after a .t / . Thus, hai D ˚ a .1/ ; a .2/ ; : : : ; a .t /  , and so jhaij හ t . To show that jhaij  t , we show that each element of the se- quence a .1/ ; a .2/ ; : : : ; a .t / is distinct. Suppose for the purpose of contradiction that a .i / D a .j / for some i and j satisfying 1 හ i < j හ t . Then, a .i Ck/ D a .j Ck/ for 31.3 Modular arithmetic 923 k  0. But this equation implies that a .i C.t j // D a .j C.t j // D e, a contradiction, since i C .t  j / < t but t is the least positive value such that a .t / D e. There- fore, each element of the sequence a .1/ ; a .2/ ; : : : ; a .t / is distinct, and jhaij  t . We conclude that ord.a/ D jhaij. Corollary 31.18 The sequence a .1/ ; a .2/ ; : : : is periodic with period t D ord.a/, that is, a .i / D a .j / if and only if i D j .mod t/. Consistent with the above corollary, we deûne a .0/ as e and a .i / as a .i mod t / , where t D ord.a/, for all integers i . Corollary 31.19 If .S; Ü/ is a ûnite group with identity e, then for all a 2 S , a .jS j/ D e : Proof Lagrange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) implies that ord.a/ j jS j, and so jS j D 0 .mod t/, where t D ord.a/. Therefore, a .jS j/ D a .0/ D e. Exercises 31.3-1 Draw the group operation tables for the groups .Z 4 ; C 4 / and .Z  5 ;  5 /.

Z  n deûned by f a .x/ D ax mod n is a permutation of Z  n . 924 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms 31.4 Solving modular linear equations We now consider the problem of ûnding solutions to the equation ax D b .mod n/ ; (31.26) where a > 0 and n > 0. This problem has several applications. For example, we’ll use it in Section 31.7 as part of the procedure to ûnd keys in the RSA public-key cryptosystem. We assume that a, b, and n are given, and we wish to ûnd all values of x , modulo n, that satisfy equation (31.26). The equation may have zero, one, or more than one such solution. Let hai denote the subgroup of Z n generated by a. Since hai D fa .x/ W x > 0g D fax mod n W x > 0g, equation (31.26) has a solution if and only if Œb� 2 hai. Lagrange’s theorem (Theorem 31.15) tells us that jhaij must be a divisor of n. The following theorem gives us a precise characterization of hai. Theorem 31.20 For any positive integers a and n, if d D gcd.a; n/, then we have hai D hd i D f0; d; 2d; : : : ; ..n=d /  1/d g in Z n , and thus jhaij D n=d : Proof We begin by showing that d 2 hai. Recall that EXTENDED-EUCLID .a; n/ returns a triple .d; x; y/ such that ax C ny D d . Thus, ax D d .mod n/, so that d 2 hai. In other words, d is a multiple of a in Z n . Since d 2 hai, it follows that every multiple of d belongs to hai, because any multiple of a multiple of a is itself a multiple of a. Thus, hai contains every element in f0; d; 2d; : : : ; ..n=d /  1/d g. That is, hd i ෂ hai. We now show that hai ෂ hd i. If m 2 hai, then m D ax mod n for some integer x , and so m D ax C ny for some integer y . Because d D gcd.a; n/, we know that d j a and d j n, and so d j m by equation (31.4). Therefore, m 2 hd i. Combining these results, we have that hai D hd i. To see that jhaij D n=d , observe that there are exactly n=d multiples of d between 0 and n  1, inclusive. Corollary 31.21 The equation ax D b .mod n/ is solvable for the unknown x if and only if d j b, where d D gcd.a; n/. 31.4 Solving modular linear equations 925 Proof The equation ax D b .mod n/ is solvable if and only if Œb� 2 hai, which is the same as saying .b mod n/ 2 f0; d; 2d; : : : ; ..n=d /  1/d g ; by Theorem 31.20. If 0 හ b < n, then b 2 hai if and only if d j b, since the members of hai are precisely the multiples of d . If b < 0 or b  n, the corollary then follows from the observation that d j b if and only if d j .b mod n/, since b and b mod n differ by a multiple of n, which is itself a multiple of d . Corollary 31.22 The equation ax D b .mod n/ either has d distinct solutions modulo n, where d D gcd.a; n/, or it has no solutions. Proof If ax D b .mod n/ has a solution, then b 2 hai. By Theorem 31.17, ord.a/ D jhaij, and so Corollary 31.18 and Theorem 31.20 imply that the sequence ai mod n, for i D 0; 1; : : :, is periodic with period jhaij D n=d . If b 2 hai, then b appears exactly d times in the sequence ai mod n, for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n  1, since the length-.n=d / block of values hai repeats exactly d times as i increases from 0 to n 1. The indices x of the d positions for which ax mod n D b are the solutions of the equation ax D b .mod n/. Theorem 31.23 Let d D gcd.a; n/, and suppose that d D ax 0 C ny 0 for some integers x 0 and y 0 (for example, as computed by E XTENDED-EUCLID). If d j b, then the equation ax D b .mod n/ has as one of its solutions the value x 0 , where x 0 D x 0 .b=d / mod n : Proof We have ax 0 D ax 0 .b=d / . mod n/ D d.b=d / . mod n/ (because ax 0 D d .mod n/) D b .mod n/ ; and thus x 0 is a solution to ax D b .mod n/. Theorem 31.24 Suppose that the equation ax D b .mod n/ is solvable (that is, d j b, where d D gcd.a; n/) and that x 0 is any solution to this equation. Then, this equa- tion has exactly d distinct solutions, modulo n, given by x i D x 0 C i.n=d / for i D 0; 1; : : : ; d  1. 926 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms Proof Because n=d > 0 and 0 හ i.n=d / < n for i D 0; 1; : : : ; d  1, the values x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x d 1 are all distinct, modulo n. Since x 0 is a solution of ax D b .mod n/, we have ax 0 mod n D b .mod n/. Thus, for i D 0; 1; : : : ; d  1, we have ax i mod n D a.x 0 C i n=d / mod n D .ax 0 C ai n=d / mod n D ax 0 mod n (because d j a implies that ai n=d is a multiple of n) D b .mod n/ ; and hence ax i D b .mod n/, making x i a solution, too. By Corollary 31.22, the equation ax D b .mod n/ has exactly d solutions, so that x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x d 1 must be all of them. We have now developed the mathematics needed to solve the equation ax D b .mod n/. The procedure MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATION-SOLVER prints all so- lutions to this equation. The inputs a and n are arbitrary positive integers, and b is an arbitrary integer. MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATION-SOLVER .a; b; n/ 1 .d; x 0 ; y 0 / D EXTENDED-EUCLID .a; n/ 2 if d j b 3 x 0 D x 0 .b=d / mod n 4 for i D 0 to d  1 5 print .x 0 C i.n=d // mod n 6 else print <no solutions= As an example of the operation of MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATION-SOLVER, consider the equation 14x D 30 . mod 100/ (and thus a D 14, b D 30, and n D 100). Calling EXTENDED-EUCLID in line 1 gives .d; x 0 ; y 0 / D .2; 7; 1/. Since 2 j 30, lines 335 execute. Line 3 computes x 0 D .7/.15/ mod 100 D 95. The for loop of lines 435 prints the two solutions, 95 and 45. The procedure MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATION-SOLVER works as follows. The call to EXTENDED-EUCLID in line 1 returns a triple .d; x 0 ; y 0 / such that d D gcd.a; n/ and d D ax 0 C ny 0 . Therefore, x 0 is a solution to the equation ax 0 D d .mod n/. If d does not divide b, then the equation ax D b .mod n/ has no solution, by Corollary 31.21. Line 2 checks to see whether d j b, and if not, line 6 reports that there are no solutions. Otherwise, line 3 computes a so- lution x 0 to ax D b .mod n/, as Theorem 31.23 suggests. Given one solution, Theorem 31.24 states that adding multiples of .n=d /, modulo n, yields the other 31.4 Solving modular linear equations 927 d  1 solutions. The for loop of lines 435 prints out all d solutions, beginning with x 0 and spaced n=d apart, modulo n. MODULAR-LINEAR-EQUATION-SOLVER performs O.lg n C gcd.a; n// arith- metic operations, since EXTENDED-EUCLID performs O.lg n/ arithmetic opera- tions, and each iteration of the for loop of lines 435 performs a constant number of arithmetic operations. The following corollaries of Theorem 31.24 give specializations of particular interest. Corollary 31.25 For any n > 1, if gcd.a; n/ D 1, then the equation ax D b .mod n/ has a unique solution, modulo n. If b D 1, a common case of considerable interest, the x that solves the equation is a multiplicative inverse of a, modulo n. Corollary 31.26 For any n > 1, if gcd.a; n/ D 1, then the equation ax D 1 .mod n/ has a unique solution, modulo n. Otherwise, it has no solution. Thanks to Corollary 31.26, the notation a 1 mod n refers to the multiplicative inverse of a, modulo n, when a and n are relatively prime. If gcd.a; n/ D 1, then the unique solution to the equation ax D 1 .mod n/ is the integer x returned by EXTENDED-EUCLID, since the equation gcd.a; n/ D 1 D ax C ny implies ax D 1 .mod n/. Thus, EXTENDED-EUCLID can compute a 1 mod n efûciently. Exercises 31.4-1 Find all solutions to the equation 35x D 10 . mod 50/. 31.4-2 Prove that the equation ax D ay . mod n/ implies x D y .mod n/ whenever gcd.a; n/ D 1. Show that the condition gcd.a; n/ D 1 is necessary by supplying a counterexample with gcd.a; n/ > 1. 928 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms 31.4-3 Consider the following change to line 3 of the procedure MODULAR-LINEAR- EQUATION-SOLVER: 3 x 0 D x 0 .b=d / mod .n=d / With this change, will the procedure still work?

Prove by induction on t that if p is prime, then a polynomial f .x/ of degree t can have at most t distinct zeros modulo p. 31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem Around 100 C. E., the Chinese mathematician Sun-Ts˘ u solved the problem of ûnd- ing those integers x that leave remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 re- spectively. One such solution is x D 23, and all solutions are of the form 23 C105k for arbitrary integers k. The <Chinese remainder theorem= provides a correspon- dence between a system of equations modulo a set of pairwise relatively prime moduli (for example, 3, 5, and 7) and an equation modulo their product (for exam- ple, 105). The Chinese remainder theorem has two major applications. Let the inte- ger n be factored as n D n 1 n 2    n k , where the factors n i are pairwise relatively prime. First, the Chinese remainder theorem is a descriptive <structure theorem= that describes the structure of Z n as identical to that of the Cartesian product Z n 1  Z n 2      Z n k with componentwise addition and multiplication modulo n i in the i th component. Second, this description helps in designing efûcient algo- rithms, since working in each of the systems Z n i can be more efûcient (in terms of bit operations) than working modulo n. Theorem 31.27 (Chinese remainder theorem) Let n D n 1 n 2    n k , where the n i are pairwise relatively prime. Consider the correspondence $ .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k / ; (31.27) where a 2 Z n , a i 2 Z n i , and 31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem 929 i D a mod n i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Then, mapping (31.27) is a one-to-one mapping (bijection) between Z n and the Cartesian product Z n 1  Z n 2      Z n k . Operations per- formed on the elements of Z n can be equivalently performed on the corresponding k-tuples by performing the operations independently in each coordinate position in the appropriate system. That is, if $ .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k / ; b $ .b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b k / ; then .a C b/ mod n $ ..a 1 C b 1 / mod n 1 ; : : : ; .a k C b k / mod n k / ; (31.28) .a  b/ mod n $ ..a 1  b 1 / mod n 1 ; : : : ; .a k  b k / mod n k / ; (31.29) .ab/ mod n $ .a 1 b 1 mod n 1 ; : : : ; a k b k mod n k / : (31.30) Proof Let’s see how to translate between the two representations. Going from a to .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k / requires only k <mod= operations. The reverse4computing a from inputs .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a k /4is only slightly more complicated. We begin by deûning m i D n=n i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Thus, m i is the product of all of the n j ’s other than n i : m i D n 1 n 2    n i 1 n i C1    n k . We next deûne c i D m i .m 1 i mod n i / (31.31) for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. Equation (31.31) is well deûned: since m i and n i are rela- tively prime (by Theorem 31.6), Corollary 31.26 guarantees that m 1 i mod n i ex- ists. Here is how to compute a as a function of the a i and c i : a D .a 1 c 1 C a 2 c 2 C    C a k c k / .mod n/ : (31.32) We now show that equation (31.32) ensures that a D a i .mod n i / for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. If j ¤ i , then m j D 0 .mod n i /, which implies that c j D m j D 0 .mod n i /. Note also that c i D 1 .mod n i /, from equation (31.31). We thus have the appealing and useful correspondence i $ .0; 0; : : : ; 0; 1; 0; : : : ; 0/ ; a vector that has 0s everywhere except in the i th coordinate, where it has a 1. The c i thus form a <basis= for the representation, in a certain sense. For each i , therefore, we have D a i c i .mod n i / D a i m i .m 1 i mod n i / .mod n i / D a i .mod n i / ; 930 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms which is what we wished to show: our method of computing a from the a i ’s pro- duces a result a that satisûes the constraints a D a i .mod n i / for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. The correspondence is one-to-one, since we can transform in both directions. Finally, equations (31.28)3(31.30) follow directly from Exercise 31.1-7, since x mod n i D .x mod n/ mod n i for any x and i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. We’ll use the following corollaries later in this chapter.

Because 13 1 D 2 .mod 5/ and 5 1 D 8 .mod 13/, you compute c 1 D 13  .2 mod 5/ D 26 ; c 2 D 5  .8 mod 13/ D 40 ; and D 2  26 C 3  40 . mod 65/ D 52 C 120 .mod 65/ D 42 .mod 65/ : 31.5 The Chinese remainder theorem 931 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0 0 40 15 55 30 5 45 20 60 35 10 50 25 1 26 1 41 16 56 31 6 46 21 61 36 11 51 2 52 27 2 42 17 57 32 7 47 22 62 37 12 3 13 53 28 3 43 18 58 33 8 48 23 63 38 4 39 14 54 29 4 44 19 59 34 9 49 24 64 Figure 31.3 An illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem for n 1 D 5 and n 2 D 13. For this example, c 1 D 26 and c 2 D 40. In row i , column j is shown the value of a, modulo 65, such that a mod 5 D i and a mod 13 D j . Note that row 0, column 0 contains a 0. Similarly, row 4, column 12 contains a 64 (equivalent to 1). Since c 1 D 26, moving down a row increases a by 26. Similarly, c 2 D 40 means that moving right by a column increases a by 40. Increasing a by 1 corresponds to moving diagonally downward and to the right, wrapping around from the bottom to the top and from the right to the left. See Figure 31.3 for an illustration of the Chinese remainder theorem, modulo 65. Thus, you can work modulo n by working modulo n directly or by working in the transformed representation using separate modulo n i computations, as convenient. The computations are entirely equivalent.

Indexing from 0, the 0th value in this sequence is a 0 mod n D 1, and the i th value is a i mod n.

For example, h2i D f1; 2; 4g in Z  7 , and ord 7 .2/ D 3. Using the deûnition of the Euler phi function �.n/ as the size of Z  n (see Section 31.3), we now translate Corollary 31.19 into the notation of Z  n to obtain Euler’s theorem and specialize it to Z  p , where p is prime, to obtain Fermat’s theorem. Theorem 31.30 (Euler’s theorem) For any integer n > 1, a .n/ D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z  n : Theorem 31.31 (Fermat’s theorem) If p is prime, then a p1 D 1 .mod p/ for all a 2 Z  p : Proof By equation (31.22), �.p/ D p  1 if p is prime. Fermat’s theorem applies to every element in Z p except 0, since 0 … Z  p . For all a 2 Z p , however, we have a p D a .mod p/ if p is prime. If ord n .g/ D jZ  n j, then every element in Z  n is a power of g, modulo n, and g is a primitive root or a generator of Z  n . For example, 3 is a primitive root, modulo 7, but 2 is not a primitive root, modulo 7. If Z  n possesses a primitive root, the group Z  n is cyclic. We omit the proof of the following theorem, which is proven by Niven and Zuckerman [345]. 31.6 Powers of an element 933 Theorem 31.32 The values of n > 1 for which Z  n is cyclic are 2, 4, p e , and 2p e , for all primes p > 2 and all positive integers e. If g is a primitive root of Z  n and a is any element of Z  n , then there exists a ´ such that g ´ D a .mod n/. This ´ is a discrete logarithm or an index of a, modulo n, to the base g. We denote this value as ind n;g .a/. Theorem 31.33 (Discrete logarithm theorem) If g is a primitive root of Z  n , then the equation g x D g y .mod n/ holds if and only if the equation x D y .mod �.n// holds. Proof Suppose ûrst that x D y .mod �.n//. Then, we have x D y C k�.n/ for some integer k, and thus g x D g yCk.n/ .mod n/ D g y  .g .n/ / k .mod n/ D g y  1 k .mod n/ (by Euler’s theorem) D g y .mod n/ : Conversely, suppose that g x D g y .mod n/. Because the sequence of powers of g generates every element of hgi and jhgij D �.n/, Corollary 31.18 implies that the sequence of powers of g is periodic with period �.n/. Therefore, if g x D g y .mod n/, we must have x D y .mod �.n//. Let’s now turn our attention to the square roots of 1, modulo a prime power. The following properties will be useful to justify the primality-testing algorithm in Section 31.8. Theorem 31.34 If p is an odd prime and e  1, then the equation x 2 D 1 .mod p e / (31.33) has only two solutions, namely x D 1 and x D 1. Proof By Exercise 31.6-2, equation (31.33) is equivalent to p e j .x  1/.x C 1/ : Since p > 2, we can have p j .x  1/ or p j .x C 1/, but not both. (Otherwise, by property (31.3), p would also divide their difference .x C 1/  .x  1/ D 2.) If p − .x  1/, then gcd.p e ; x  1/ D 1, and by Corollary 31.5, we would have p e j .x C 1/. That is, x D 1 .mod p e /. Symmetrically, if p − .x C 1/, 934 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms then gcd.p e ; x C 1/ D 1, and Corollary 31.5 implies that p e j .x  1/, so that x D 1 .mod p e /. Therefore, either x D 1 .mod p e / or x D 1 .mod p e /. A number x is a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, if it satisûes the equation x 2 D 1 .mod n/ but x is equivalent to neither of the two <trivial= square roots: 1 or 1, modulo n. For example, 6 is a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo 35. We’ll use the following corollary to Theorem 31.34 in Section 31.8 to prove the Miller-Rabin primality-testing procedure correct. Corollary 31.35 If there exists a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, then n is composite. Proof By the contrapositive of Theorem 31.34, if there exists a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, then n cannot be an odd prime or a power of an odd prime. Nor can n be 2, because if x 2 D 1 .mod 2/, then x D 1 .mod 2/, and therefore, all square roots of 1, modulo 2, are trivial. Thus, n cannot be prime. Finally, we must have n > 1 for a nontrivial square root of 1 to exist. Therefore, n must be composite. Raising to powers with repeated squaring A frequently occurring operation in number-theoretic computations is raising one number to a power modulo another number, also known as modular exponentia- tion. More precisely, we would like an efûcient way to compute a b mod n, where a and b are nonnegative integers and n is a positive integer. Modular exponenti- ation is an essential operation in many primality-testing routines and in the RSA public-key cryptosystem. The method of repeated squaring solves this problem efûciently. Repeated squaring is based on the following formula to compute a b for nonneg- ative integers a and b: a b D Ĩ 1 if b D 0 ; .a b=2 / 2 if b > 0 and b is even ; a  a b1 if b > 0 and b is odd : (31.34) The last case, where b is odd, reduces to the one of the ûrst two cases, since if b is odd, then b  1 is even. The recursive procedure MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION on the next page computes a b mod n using equation (31.34), but performing all computations modulo n. The term <repeated squaring= comes from squaring the intermediate result d D a b=2 in line 5. Figure 31.4 shows the values of the param- eter b, the local variable d , and the value returned at each level of the recursion for the call MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION .7; 560; 561/, which returns the result 1. 31.6 Powers of an element 935 b 560 280 140 70 35 34 17 16 8 4 2 1 0 d 67 166 298 241 355 160 103 526 157 49 7 1 – returned value 1 67 166 298 241 355 160 103 526 157 49 7 1 Figure 31.4 The values of the parameter b, the local variable d , and the value returned for recursive calls of MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION with parameter values a D 7, b D 560, and n D 561.

Assume that b > 0 and that the most signiûcant bit of b is a 1. Each 0 generates one recursive call (in line 4), and each 1 generates two recursive calls (one in line 6 followed by one in line 4 because if b is odd, then b  1 is even). If the inputs a, b, and n are ˇ-bit numbers, then there are between ˇ and 2ˇ  1 recursive calls altogether, the total number of arithmetic operations required is O.ˇ/, and the total number of bit operations required is O.ˇ 3 /.

A public-key cryptosystem also en- ables a party to append an unforgeable <digital signature= to the end of an electronic message. Such a signature is the electronic version of a handwritten signature on a paper document. It can be easily checked by anyone, forged by no one, yet loses its validity if any bit of the message is altered. It therefore provides authentica- tion of both the identity of the signer and the contents of the signed message. It is the perfect tool for electronically signed business contracts, electronic checks, electronic purchase orders, and other electronic communications that parties wish to authenticate. The RSA public-key cryptosystem relies on the dramatic difference between the ease of ûnding large prime numbers and the difûculty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Section 31.8 describes an efûcient procedure for ûnding large prime numbers. Public-key cryptosystems In a public-key cryptosystem, each participant has both a public key and a secret key. Each key is a piece of information. For example, in the RSA cryptosystem, each key consists of a pair of integers. The participants <Alice= and <Bob= are traditionally used in cryptography examples. We denote the public keys for Alice and Bob as P A and P B , respectively, and likewise the secret keys are S A for Alice and S B for Bob. Each participant creates his or her own public and secret keys. Secret keys are kept secret, but public keys can be revealed to anyone or even published. In fact, it is often convenient to assume that everyone’s public key is available in a pub- lic directory, so that any participant can easily obtain the public key of any other participant. 31.7 The RSA public-key cryptosystem 937 decrypt communication channel encrypt Bob Alice eavesdropper M M P A S A C C D P A .M / Figure 31.5 Encryption in a public key system. Bob encrypts the message M using Alice’s public key P A and transmits the resulting ciphertext C D P A .M / over a communication channel to Al- ice. An eavesdropper who captures the transmitted ciphertext gains no information about M . Alice receives C and decrypts it using her secret key to obtain the original message M D S A .C /. The public and secret keys specify functions that can be applied to any message. Let D denote the set of permissible messages. For example, D might be the set of all ûnite-length bit sequences. The simplest, and original, formulation of public- key cryptography requires one-to-one functions from D to itself, based on the public and secret keys. We denote the function based on Alice’s public key P A by P A ./ and the function based on her secret key S A by S A ./. The functions P A ./ and S A ./ are thus permutations of D . We assume that the functions P A ./ and S A ./ are efûciently computable given the corresponding keys P A and S A . The public and secret keys for any participant are a <matched pair= in that they specify functions that are inverses of each other. That is, M D S A .P A .M // ; (31.35) M D P A .S A .M // (31.36) for any message M 2 D . Transforming M with the two keys P A and S A succes- sively, in either order, yields back the original message M . A public-key cryptosystem requires that Alice, and only Alice, be able to com- pute the function S A ./ in any practical amount of time. This assumption is crucial to keeping encrypted messages sent to Alice private and to knowing that Alice’s digital signatures are authentic. Alice must keep her key S A secret. If she does not, whoever else has access to S A can decrypt messages intended only for Alice and can also forge her digital signature. The assumption that only Alice can reasonably compute S A ./ must hold even though everyone knows P A and can compute P A ./, the inverse function to S A ./, efûciently. These requirements appear formidable, but we’ll see how to satisfy them. In a public-key cryptosystem, encryption works as shown in Figure 31.5. Sup- pose that Bob wishes to send Alice a message M encrypted so that it looks like 938 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms sign communication channel verify =? accept Bob Alice M 0 M 0 P A S A � .M 0 ; � / � D S A .M 0 / Figure 31.6 Digital signatures in a public-key system. Alice signs the message M 0 by appending her digital signature � D S A .M 0 / to it. She transmits the message/signature pair .M 0 ; �/ to Bob, who veriûes it by checking the equation M 0 D P A .�/. If the equation holds, he accepts .M 0 ; �/ as a message that Alice has signed. unintelligible gibberish to an eavesdropper. The scenario for sending the message goes as follows. Bob obtains Alice’s public key P A , perhaps from a public directory or perhaps directly from Alice.  Bob computes the ciphertext C D P A .M / corresponding to the message M and sends C to Alice.  When Alice receives the ciphertext C , she applies her secret key S A to retrieve the original message: S A .C / D S A .P A .M // D M . Because S A ./ and P A ./ are inverse functions, Alice can compute M from C . Be- cause only Alice is able to compute S A ./, only Alice can compute M from C . Because Bob encrypts M using P A ./, only Alice can understand the transmitted message. Digital signatures can be implemented within this formulation of a public-key cryptosystem. (There are other ways to construct digital signatures, but we won’t go into them here.) Suppose now that Alice wishes to send Bob a digitally signed response M 0 . Figure 31.6 shows how the digital-signature scenario proceeds.  Alice computes her digital signature � for the message M 0 using her secret key S A and the equation � D S A .M 0 /.  Alice sends the message/signature pair .M 0 ; � / to Bob.  When Bob receives .M 0 ; � /, he can verify that it originated from Alice by using Alice’s public key to verify the equation M 0 D P A .� /. (Presumably, M 0 con- tains Alice’s name, so that Bob knows whose public key to use.) If the equation holds, then Bob concludes that the message M 0 was actually signed by Alice. If 31.7 The RSA public-key cryptosystem 939 the equation fails to hold, Bob concludes either that the information he received was corrupted by transmission errors or that the pair .M 0 ; � / is an attempted forgery. Because a digital signature provides both authentication of the signer’s identity and authentication of the contents of the signed message, it is analogous to a handwrit- ten signature at the end of a written document. A digital signature must be veriûable by anyone who has access to the signer’s public key. A signed message can be veriûed by one party and then passed on to other parties who can also verify the signature. For example, the message might be an electronic check from Alice to Bob. After Bob veriûes Alice’s signature on the check, he can give the check to his bank, who can then also verify the signature and effect the appropriate funds transfer. A signed message may or may not be encrypted. The message can be <in the clear= and not protected from disclosure. By composing the above protocols for encryption and for signatures, Alice can create a message to Bob that is both signed and encrypted. Alice ûrst appends her digital signature to the message and then encrypts the resulting message/signature pair with Bob’s public key. Bob decrypts the received message with his secret key to obtain both the original message and its digital signature. Bob can then verify the signature using Alice’s public key. The corresponding combined process using paper-based systems would be to sign the paper document and then seal the document inside a paper envelope that is opened only by the intended recipient. The RSA cryptosystem In the RSA public-key cryptosystem, a participant creates a public key and a secret key with the following procedure: 1. Select at random two large prime numbers p and q such that p ¤ q. The primes p and q might be, say, 1024 bits each. 2. Compute n D pq. 3. Select a small odd integer e that is relatively prime to �.n/, which, by equa- tion (31.21), equals .p  1/.q  1/. 4. Compute d as the multiplicative inverse of e, modulo �.n/. (Corollary 31.26 guarantees that d exists and is uniquely deûned. You can use the technique of Section 31.4 to compute d , given e and �.n/.) 5. Publish the pair P D .e; n/ as the participant’s RSA public key. 6. Keep secret the pair S D .d; n/ as the participant’s RSA secret key. 940 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms For this scheme, the domain D is the set Z n . To transform a message M asso- ciated with a public key P D .e; n/, compute P .M / D M e mod n : (31.37) To transform a ciphertext C associated with a secret key S D .d; n/, compute S.C / D C d mod n : (31.38) These equations apply to both encryption and signatures. To create a signature, the signer’s secret key is applied to the message to be signed, rather than to a ciphertext. To verify a signature, the public key of the signer is applied to the signature rather than to a message to be encrypted. To implement the public-key and secret-key operations (31.37) and (31.38), you can use the procedure MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION described in Section 31.6. To analyze the running time of these operations, assume that the public key .e; n/ and secret key .d; n/ satisfy lg e D O.1/, lg d හ ˇ, and lg n හ ˇ. Then, applying a public key requires O.1/ modular multiplications and uses O.ˇ 2 / bit operations. Applying a secret key requires O.ˇ/ modular multiplications, using O.ˇ 3 / bit operations. Theorem 31.36 (Correctness of RSA) The RSA equations (31.37) and (31.38) deûne inverse transformations of Z n satis- fying equations (31.35) and (31.36). Proof From equations (31.37) and (31.38), we have that for any M 2 Z n , P .S.M // D S.P .M // D M ed .mod n/ : Since e and d are multiplicative inverses modulo �.n/ D .p  1/.q  1/, ed D 1 C k.p  1/.q  1/ for some integer k. But then, if M ¤ 0 .mod p/, we have M ed D M.M p1 / k.q1/ .mod p/ D M..M mod p/ p1 / k.q1/ .mod p/ D M.1/ k.q1/ .mod p/ (by Theorem 31.31) D M .mod p/ : Also, M ed D M .mod p/ if M D 0 .mod p/. Thus, M ed D M .mod p/ for all M . Similarly, 31.7 The RSA public-key cryptosystem 941 M ed D M .mod q/ for all M . Thus, by Corollary 31.29 to the Chinese remainder theorem, M ed D M .mod n/ for all M . The security of the RSA cryptosystem rests in large part on the difûculty of fac- toring large integers. If an adversary can factor the modulus n in a public key, then the adversary can derive the secret key from the public key, using the knowledge of the factors p and q in the same way that the creator of the public key used them. Therefore, if factoring large integers is easy, then breaking the RSA cryptosystem is easy. The converse statement, that if factoring large integers is hard, then break- ing RSA is hard, is unproven. After two decades of research, however, no easier method has been found to break the RSA public-key cryptosystem than to factor the modulus n. And factoring large integers is surprisingly difûcult. By randomly selecting and multiplying together two 1024-bit primes, you can create a public key that cannot be <broken= in any feasible amount of time with current technology. In the absence of a fundamental breakthrough in the design of number-theoretic al- gorithms, and when implemented with care following recommended standards, the RSA cryptosystem is capable of providing a high degree of security in applications. In order to achieve security with the RSA cryptosystem, however, you should use integers that are quite long4more than 1000 bits4to resist possible advances in the art of factoring. In 2021, RSA moduli are commonly in the range of 2048 to 4096 bits. To create moduli of such sizes, you must ûnd large primes efûciently. Section 31.8 addresses this problem. For efûciency, RSA is often used in a <hybrid= or <key-management= mode with fast cryptosystems that are not public-key cryptosystems. With such a symmetric- key system, the encryption and decryption keys are identical. If Alice wishes to send a long message M to Bob privately, she selects a random key K for the fast symmetric-key cryptosystem and encrypts M using K, obtaining ciphertext C , where C is as long as M , but K is quite short. Then she encrypts K using Bob’s public RSA key. Since K is short, computing P B .K/ is fast (much faster than computing P B .M /). She then transmits .C; P B .K// to Bob, who decrypts P B .K/ to obtain K and then uses K to decrypt C , obtaining M . A similar hybrid approach creates digital signatures efûciently. This approach combines RSA with a public collision-resistant hash function h4a function that is easy to compute but for which it is computationally infeasible to ûnd two mes- sages M and M 0 such that h.M / D h.M 0 /. The value h.M / is a short (say, 256-bit) <ûngerprint= of the message M . If Alice wishes to sign a message M , she ûrst applies h to M to obtain the ûngerprint h.M /, which she then encrypts with her secret key. She sends .M; S A .h.M /// to Bob as her signed version of M . 942 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms Bob can verify the signature by computing h.M / and verifying that P A applied to S A .h.M // as received equals h.M /. Because no one can create two messages with the same ûngerprint, it is computationally infeasible to alter a signed message and preserve the validity of the signature. One way to distribute public keys uses certiûcates. For example, assume that there is a <trusted authority= T whose public key is known by everyone. Alice can obtain from T a signed message (her certiûcate) stating that <Alice’s public key is P A .= This certiûcate is <self-authenticating= since everyone knows P T . Alice can include her certiûcate with her signed messages, so that the recipient has Alice’s public key immediately available in order to verify her signature. Because her key was signed by T , the recipient knows that Alice’s key is really Alice’s. Exercises 31.7-1 Consider an RSA key set with p D 11, q D 29, n D 319, and e D 3. What value of d should be used in the secret key? What is the encryption of the message M D 100? 31.7-2 Prove that if Alice’s public exponent e is 3 and an adversary obtains Alice’s secret exponent d , where 0 < d < �.n/, then the adversary can factor Alice’s modulus n in time polynomial in the number of bits in n. (Although you are not asked to prove it, you might be interested to know that this result remains true even if the condition e D 3 is removed. See Miller [327].) ? 31.7-3 Prove that RSA is multiplicative in the sense that A .M 1 /P A .M 2 / D P A .M 1 M 2 / .mod n/ : Use this fact to prove that if an adversary had a procedure that could efûciently decrypt 1% of messages from Z n encrypted with P A , then the adversary could employ a probabilistic algorithm to decrypt every message encrypted with P A with high probability. ? 31.8 Primality testing This section shows how to ûnd large primes. We begin with a discussion of the density of primes, proceed to examine a plausible, but incomplete, approach to 31.8 Primality testing 943 primality testing, and then present an effective randomized primality test due to Miller and Rabin. The density of prime numbers Many applications, such as cryptography, call for ûnding large <random= primes. Fortunately, large primes are not too rare, so that it is feasible to test random inte- gers of the appropriate size until you ûnd one that is prime. The prime distribution function �.n/ speciûes the number of primes that are less than or equal to n. For example, �.10/ D 4, since there are 4 prime numbers less than or equal to 10, namely, 2, 3, 5, and 7. The prime number theorem gives a useful approximation to �.n/. Theorem 31.37 (Prime number theorem) lim n!1 �.n/ n= ln n D 1 : The approximation n= ln n gives reasonably accurate estimates of �.n/ even for small n. For example, it is off by less than 6% at n D 10 9 , where �.n/ D 50,847,534 and n= ln n  48,254,942. (To a number theorist, 10 9 is a small num- ber.) The process of randomly selecting an integer n and determining whether it is prime is really just a Bernoulli trial (see Section C.4). By the prime number the- orem, the probability of a success4that is, the probability that n is prime4is ap- proximately 1= ln n. The geometric distribution says how many trials must occur to obtain a success, and by equation (C.36) on page 1197, the expected number of trials is approximately ln n. Thus, in order to ûnd a prime that has the same length as n by testing integers chosen randomly near n, the expected number ex- amined would be approximately ln n. For example, the expectation is that ûnding a 1024-bit prime would require testing approximately ln 2 1024  710 randomly cho- sen 1024-bit numbers for primality. (Of course, to cut this ûgure in half, choose only odd integers.) The remainder of this section shows how to determine whether a large odd in- teger n is prime. For notational convenience, we assume that n has the prime factorization D p e 1 1 p e 2 2    p e r r ; where r  1, p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p r are the prime factors of n, and e 1 ; e 2 ; : : : ; e r are posi- tive integers. The integer n is prime if and only if r D 1 and e 1 D 1. One simple approach to the problem of testing for primality is trial division: try dividing n by each integer 2; 3; 5; 7; 9; : : : ; b p nc, skipping even integers greater 944 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms than 2. We can conclude that n is prime if and only if none of the trial divisors divides n. Assuming that each trial division takes constant time, the worst-case running time is ‚. p n/, which is exponential in the length of n. (Recall that if n is encoded in binary using ˇ bits, then ˇ D dlg.n C 1/e, and so p n D ‚.2 ˇ=2 /.) Thus, trial division works well only if n is very small or happens to have a small prime factor. When it works, trial division has the advantage that it not only deter- mines whether n is prime or composite, it also determines one of n’s prime factors if n is composite. This section focuses on ûnding out whether a given number n is prime. If n is composite, we won’t worry about ûnding its prime factorization. Computing the prime factorization of a number is computationally expensive. You might be surprised that it turns out to be much easier to ascertain whether a given number is prime than it is to determine the prime factorization of the number if it is not prime. Pseudoprimality testing We’ll start with a method for primality testing that <almost works= and, in fact, is good enough for many practical applications. Later on, we’ll reûne this method to remove the small defect. Let Z C n denote the nonzero elements of Z n : Z C n D f1; 2; : : : ; n  1g : If n is prime, then Z C n D Z  n . We say that n is a base-a pseudoprime if n is composite and a n1 D 1 .mod n/ : (31.39) Fermat’s theorem (Theorem 31.31 on page 932) implies that if n is prime, then n satisûes equation (31.39) for every a in Z C n . Thus, if there is any a 2 Z C n such that n does not satisfy equation (31.39), then n is certainly composite. Surprisingly, the converse almost holds, so that this criterion forms an almost perfect test for primality. Instead of trying every value of a 2 Z C n , test to see whether n satisûes equation (31.39) for just a D 2. If not, then declare n to be composite by returning COMPOSITE. Otherwise, return PRIME, guessing that n is prime (when, in fact, all we know is that n is either prime or a base-2 pseudoprime). The procedure PSEUDOPRIME on the next page pretends in this manner to check whether n is prime. It uses the procedure MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION from Section 31.6. It assumes that the input n is an odd integer greater than 2. This pro- cedure can make errors, but only of one type. That is, if it says that n is composite, then it is always correct. If it says that n is prime, however, then it makes an error only if n is a base-2 pseudoprime. How often does PSEUDOPRIME err? Surprisingly rarely. There are only 22 val- ues of n less than 10,000 for which it errs, the ûrst four of which are 341, 561, 645, 31.8 Primality testing 945 PSEUDOPRIME .n/ 1 if MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION .2; n  1; n/ ¤ 1 .mod n/ 2 return COMPOSITE // deûnitely 3 else return PRIME // we hope! and 1105. We won’t prove it, but the probability that this program makes an error on a randomly chosen ˇ-bit number goes to 0 as ˇ approaches 1. Using more precise estimates due to Pomerance [361] of the number of base-2 pseudoprimes of a given size, a randomly chosen 512-bit number that is called prime by PSEU- DOPRIME has less than one chance in 10 20 of being a base-2 pseudoprime, and a randomly chosen 1024-bit number that is called prime has less than one chance in 10 41 of being a base-2 pseudoprime. Thus, if you are merely trying to ûnd a large prime for some application, for all practical purposes you almost never go wrong by choosing large numbers at random until one of them causes P SEUDOPRIME to return PRIME. But when the numbers being tested for primality are not randomly chosen, you might need a better approach for testing primality. As we’ll see, a lit- tle more cleverness, and some randomization, will yield a primality-testing method that works well on all inputs. Since PSEUDOPRIME checks equation (31.39) for only a D 2, you might think that you could eliminate all the errors by simply checking equation (31.39) for a second base number, say a D 3. Better yet, you could check equation (31.39) for even more values of a. Unfortunately, even checking for several values of a does not eliminate all errors, because there exist composite integers n, known as Carmichael numbers, that satisfy equation (31.39) for all a 2 Z  n . (The equation does fail when gcd.a; n/ > 14that is, when a … Z  n 4but demonstrating that n is composite by ûnding such an a can be difûcult if n has only large prime factors.) The ûrst three Carmichael numbers are 561, 1105, and 1729. Carmichael numbers are extremely rare. For example, only 255 of them are less than 100,000,000. Exercise 31.8-2 helps explain why they are so rare. Let’s see how to improve the primality test so that Carmichael numbers won’t fool it. The Miller-Rabin randomized primality test The Miller-Rabin primality test overcomes the problems of the simple procedure PSEUDOPRIME with two modiûcations:  It tries several randomly chosen base values a instead of just one base value.  While computing each modular exponentiation, it looks for a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, during the ûnal set of squarings. If it ûnds one, it stops 946 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms and returns COMPOSITE. Corollary 31.35 from Section 31.6 justiûes detecting composites in this manner. The pseudocode for the Miller-Rabin primality test appears in the procedures MILLER-RABIN and WITNESS. The input n > 2 to MILLER-RABIN is the odd number to be tested for primality, and s is the number of randomly chosen base values from Z C n to be tried. The code uses the random-number generator R ANDOM described on page 129: R ANDOM.2; n  2/ returns a randomly chosen integer a satisfying 2 හ a හ n  2. (This range of values avoids having a D Û1 .mod n/.) The call of the auxiliary procedure WITNESS .a; n/ returns TRUE if and only if a is a <witness= to the compositeness of n4that is, if it is possible using a to prove (in a manner that we will see) that n is composite. The test WITNESS .a; n/ is an extension of, but more effective than, the test in equation (31.39) that formed the basis for PSEUDOPRIME, using a D 2. Let’s ûrst understand how WITNESS works, and then we’ll see how the Miller- Rabin primality test uses it. Let n  1 D 2 t u where t  1 and u is odd. That is, the binary representation of n  1 is the binary representation of the odd integer u followed by exactly t zeros. Therefore, a n1 D .a u / 2 t .mod n/, so that one way to compute a n1 mod n is to ûrst compute a u mod n and then square the result t times successively. MILLER-RABIN .n; s/ // n > 2 is odd 1 for j D 1 to s 2 a D RANDOM.2; n  2/ 3 if WITNESS .a; n/ 4 return COMPOSITE // deûnitely 5 return PRIME // almost surely WITNESS .a; n/ 1 let t and u be such that t  1, u is odd, and n  1 D 2 t u 2 x 0 D MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION .a; u; n/ 3 for i D 1 to t 4 x i D x 2 i 1 mod n 5 if x i == 1 and x i 1 ¤ 1 and x i 1 ¤ n  1 6 return TRUE // found a nontrivial square root of 1 7 if x t ¤ 1 8 return TRUE // composite, as in PSEUDOPRIME 9 return FALSE 31.8 Primality testing 947 This pseudocode for WITNESS computes a n1 mod n by ûrst computing the value x 0 D a u mod n in line 2 and then repeatedly squaring the result t times in the for loop of lines 336. By induction on i , the sequence x 0 , x 1 , . . . , x t of values computed satisûes the equation x i D a 2 i u .mod n/ for i D 0; 1; : : : ; t , so that in particular x t D a n1 .mod n/. After line 4 performs a squaring step, however, the loop will terminate early if lines 536 detect that a nontrivial square root of 1 has just been discovered. (We’ll explain these tests shortly.) If so, the procedure stops and returns TRUE. Lines 738 return TRUE if the value computed for x t D a n1 .mod n/ is not equal to 1, just as the PSEUDOPRIME procedure returns COMPOSITE in this case. Line 9 returns FALSE if lines 6 or 8 have not returned TRUE. The following lemma proves the correctness of WITNESS . Lemma 31.38 If WITNESS .a; n/ returns TRUE, then a proof that n is composite can be constructed using a as a witness. Proof If WITNESS returns TRUE from line 8, it’s because line 7 determined that x t D a n1 mod n ¤ 1. If n is prime, however, Fermat’s theorem (Theorem 31.31) says that a n1 D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z  n . Since Z C n D Z  n if n is prime, Fermat’s theorem also says that a n1 D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z C n . Therefore, n cannot be prime, and the equation a n1 mod n ¤ 1 proves this fact. If WITNESS returns TRUE from line 6, then it has discovered that x i 1 is a non- trivial square root of 1, modulo n, since we have that x i 1 ¤ Û1 .mod n/ yet x i D x 2 i 1 D 1 .mod n/. Corollary 31.35 on page 934 states that only if n is com- posite can there exist a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n, so that demonstrating that x i 1 is a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n proves that n is composite. Thus, if the call WITNESS .a; n/ returns TRUE, then n is surely composite, and the witness a, along with the reason that the procedure returns TRUE (did it return from line 6 or from line 8?), provides a proof that n is composite. Let’s explore an alternative view of the behavior of WITNESS as a function of the sequence X D hx 0 ; x 1 ; : : : ; x t i. We’ll ûnd this view useful later on, when we analyze the error rate of the Miller-Rabin primality test. Note that if x i D 1 for some 0 හ i < t , WITNESS might not compute the rest of the sequence. If it were to do so, however, each value x i C1 ; x i C2 ; : : : ; x t would be 1, so we can consider these positions in the sequence X as being all 1s. There are four cases: 1. X D h: : : ; d i, where d ¤ 1: the sequence X does not end in 1. Return TRUE in line 8, since a is a witness to the compositeness of n (by Fermat’s Theorem). 948 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms 2. X D h1; 1; : : : ; 1i: the sequence X is all 1s. Return FALSE, since a is not a witness to the compositeness of n. 3. X D h: : : ; 1; 1; : : : ; 1i: the sequence X ends in 1, and the last non-1 is equal to 1. Return FALSE, since a is not a witness to the compositeness of n. 4. X D h: : : ; d; 1; : : : ; 1i, where d ¤ Û1: the sequence X ends in 1, but the last non-1 is not 1. Return TRUE in line 6: a is a witness to the compositeness of n, since d is a nontrivial square root of 1. Now, let’s examine the Miller-Rabin primality test based on how it uses the WITNESS procedure. As before, assume that n is an odd integer greater than 2. The procedure MILLER-RABIN is a probabilistic search for a proof that n is composite. The main loop (beginning on line 1) picks up to s random values of a from Z C n , except for 1 and n  1 (line 2). If it picks a value of a that is a witness to the compositeness of n, then MILLER-RABIN returns COMPOSITE on line 4. Such a result is always correct, by the correctness of W ITNESS. If MILLER-RABIN ûnds no witness in s trials, then the procedure assumes that it found no witness because no witnesses exist, and therefore it assumes that n is prime. We’ll see that this result is likely to be correct if s is large enough, but there is still a tiny chance that the procedure could be unlucky in its choice of s random values of a, so that even though the procedure failed to ûnd a witness, at least one witness exists. To illustrate the operation of MILLER-RABIN, let n be the Carmichael num- ber 561, so that n  1 D 560 D 2 4  35, t D 4, and u D 35. If the procedure chooses a D 7 as a base, the column for b D 35 in Figure 31.4 (Section 31.6) shows that WITNESS computes x 0 D a 35 D 241 . mod 561/. Because of how the MODULAR-EXPONENTIATION procedure operates recursively on its param- eter b, the ûrst four columns in Figure 31.4 represent the factor 2 4 of 5604the rightmost four zeros in the binary representation of 5604reading these four zeros from right to left in the binary representation. Thus WITNESS computes the se- quence X D h241; 298; 166; 67; 1 i. Then, in the last squaring step, WITNESS discovers that a 280 is a nontrivial square root of 1 since a 280 D 67 . mod n/ and .a 280 / 2 D a 560 D 1 .mod n/. Therefore, a D 7 is a witness to the compositeness of n, WITNESS .7; n/ returns TRUE, and MILLER-RABIN returns COMPOSITE. If n is a ˇ-bit number, MILLER-RABIN requires O.sˇ/ arithmetic operations and O.sˇ 3 / bit operations, since it requires asymptotically no more work than s modular exponentiations. Error rate of the Miller-Rabin primality test If MILLER-RABIN returns PRIME, then there is a very slim chance that it has made an error. Unlike PSEUDOPRIME, however, the chance of error does not depend on n: there are no bad inputs for this procedure. Rather, it depends on the size of s 31.8 Primality testing 949 and the <luck of the draw= in choosing base values a. Moreover, since each test is more stringent than a simple check of equation (31.39), we can expect on general principles that the error rate should be small for randomly chosen integers n. The following theorem presents a more precise argument. Theorem 31.39 If n is an odd composite number, then the number of witnesses to the composite- ness of n is at least .n  1/=2. Proof The proof shows that the number of nonwitnesses is at most .n  1/=2, which implies the theorem. We start by claiming that any nonwitness must be a member of Z  n . Why? Consider any nonwitness a. It must satisfy a n1 D 1 .mod n/ or, equivalently, a  a n2 D 1 .mod n/. Thus the equation ax D 1 .mod n/ has a solution, namely a n2 . By Corollary 31.21 on page 924, gcd.a; n/ j 1, which in turn implies that gcd.a; n/ D 1. Therefore, a is a member of Z  n , and all nonwitnesses belong to Z  n . To complete the proof, we show that not only are all nonwitnesses contained in Z  n , they are all contained in a proper subgroup B of Z  n (recall that B is a proper subgroup of Z  n when B is subgroup of Z  n but B is not equal to Z  n ). By Corollary 31.16 on page 921, we then have jB j හ jZ  n j=2. Since jZ  n j හ n  1, we obtain jB j හ .n  1/=2. Therefore, if all nonwitnesses are contained in a proper subgroup of Z  n , then the number of nonwitnesses is at most .n  1/=2, so that the number of witnesses must be at least .n  1/=2. To ûnd a proper subgroup B of Z  n containing all of the nonwitnesses, we con- sider two cases. Case 1: There exists an x 2 Z  n such that x n1 ¤ 1 .mod n/ : In other words, n is not a Carmichael number. Since, as noted earlier, Carmichael numbers are extremely rare, case 1 is the more typical case (e.g., when n has been chosen randomly and is being tested for primality). Let B D fb 2 Z  n W b n1 D 1 .mod n/g. The set B must be nonempty, since 1 2 B . The set B is closed under multiplication modulo n, and so B is a subgroup of Z  n by Theorem 31.14. Every nonwitness belongs to B , since a nonwitness a satisûes a n1 D 1 .mod n/. Since x 2 Z  n  B , we have that B is a proper subgroup of Z  n . Case 2: For all x 2 Z  n , x n1 D 1 .mod n/ : (31.40) 950 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms In other words, n is a Carmichael number. This case is extremely rare in prac- tice. Unlike a pseudoprimality test, however, the Miller-Rabin test can efûciently determine that Carmichael numbers are composite, as we’re about to see. In this case, n cannot be a prime power. To see why, suppose to the contrary that n D p e , where p is a prime and e > 1. We derive a contradiction as follows. Since we assume that n is odd, p must also be odd. Theorem 31.32 on page 933 implies that Z  n is a cyclic group: it contains a generator g such that ord n .g/ D jZ  n j D �.n/ D p e .1  1=p/ D .p  1/p e1 . (The formula for �.n/ comes from equation (31.21) on page 920.) By equation (31.40), we have g n1 D 1 .mod n/. Then the discrete logarithm theorem (Theorem 31.33 on page 933, taking y D 0) implies that n  1 D 0 .mod �.n//, or .p  1/p e1 j p e  1 : This statement is a contradiction for e > 1, since .p  1/p e1 is divisible by the prime p, but p e  1 is not. Thus n is not a prime power. Since the odd composite number n is not a prime power, we decompose it into a product n 1 n 2 , where n 1 and n 2 are odd numbers greater than 1 that are relatively prime to each other. (There may be several ways to decompose n, and it does not matter which one we choose. For example, if n D p e 1 1 p e 2 2    p e r r , then we can choose n 1 D p e 1 1 and n 2 D p e 2 2 p e 3 3    p e r r .) Recall that t and u are such that n  1 D 2 t u, where t  1 and u is odd, and that for an input a, the procedure WITNESS computes the sequence X D ha u ; a 2u ; a 2 2 u ; : : : ; a 2 t u i where all computations are performed modulo n. Let us call a pair .v; j / of integers acceptable if v 2 Z  n , j 2 f0; 1; : : : ; t g, and v 2 j u D 1 .mod n/ : Acceptable pairs certainly exist, since u is odd. Choose v D n  1 and j D 0, and let u D 2k C 1, so that v 2 j u D .n  1/ u D .n  1/ 2kC1 . Taking this number modulo n gives .n  1/ 2kC1 D .n  1/ 2k  .n  1/ D .1/ 2k  1 D 1 .mod n/. Thus, .n  1; 0/ is an acceptable pair. Now pick the largest possible j such that there exists an acceptable pair .v; j /, and ûx v so that .v; j / is an acceptable pair. Let D fx 2 Z  n W x 2 j u D Û1 .mod n/g : Since B is closed under multiplication modulo n, it is a subgroup of Z  n . By The- orem 31.15 on page 921, therefore, jB j divides jZ  n j. Every nonwitness must be a member of B , since the sequence X produced by a nonwitness must either be all 1s or else contain a 1 no later than the j th position, by the maximality of j . 31.8 Primality testing 951 (If .a; j 0 / is acceptable, where a is a nonwitness, we must have j 0 හ j by how we chose j .) We now use the existence of v to demonstrate that there exists a w 2 Z  n  B , and hence that B is a proper subgroup of Z  n . Since v 2 j u D 1 .mod n/, we also have v 2 j u D 1 .mod n 1 / by Corollary 31.29 to the Chinese remainder theorem. By Corollary 31.28, there exists a w simultaneously satisfying the equations w D v .mod n 1 / ; w D 1 .mod n 2 / : Therefore, 2 j u D 1 .mod n 1 / ; w 2 j u D 1 .mod n 2 / : Corollary 31.29 gives that w 2 j u ¤ 1 .mod n 1 / implies w 2 j u ¤ 1 .mod n/ and also that w 2 j u ¤ 1 .mod n 2 / implies w 2 j u ¤ 1 .mod n/. Hence, we conclude that w 2 j u ¤ Û1 .mod n/, and so w … B . It remains to show that w 2 Z  n . We start by working separately mod- ulo n 1 and modulo n 2 . Working modulo n 1 , since v 2 Z  n , we have that gcd.v; n/ D 1. Also, we have gcd.v; n 1 / D 1, since if v does not have any common divisors with n, then it certainly does not have any common divisors with n 1 . Since w D v .mod n 1 /, we see that gcd.w; n 1 / D 1. Working mod- ulo n 2 , we have w D 1 .mod n 2 / implies gcd.w; n 2 / D 1 by Exercise 31.2-3. Since gcd.w; n 1 / D 1 and gcd.w; n 2 / D 1, Theorem 31.6 on page 908 yields gcd.w; n 1 n 2 / D gcd.w; n/ D 1. That is, w 2 Z  n . Therefore, we have w 2 Z  n  B , and we can conclude in case 2 that B , which includes all nonwitnesses, is a proper subgroup of Z  n and therefore has size at most .n  1/=2. In either case, the number of witnesses to the compositeness of n is at least .n  1/=2. Theorem 31.40 For any odd integer n > 2 and positive integer s , the probability that MILLER- RABIN.n; s/ errs is at most 2 s . Proof By Theorem 31.39, if n is composite, then each execution of the for loop of lines 134 of MILLER-RABIN has a probability of at least 1=2 of discovering a witness to the compositeness of n. MILLER-RABIN makes an error only if it is so unlucky as to miss discovering a witness to the compositeness of n on each of the s iterations of the main loop. The probability of such a sequence of misses is at most 2 s . 952 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms If n is prime, MILLER-RABIN always reports PRIME, and if n is composite, the chance that MILLER-RABIN reports PRIME is at most 2 s . When applying MILLER-RABIN to a large randomly chosen integer n, however, we need to consider as well the prior probability that n is prime, in order to cor- rectly interpret MILLER-RABIN’s result. Suppose that we ûx a bit length ˇ and choose at random an integer n of length ˇ bits to be tested for primality, so that ˇ  lg n  1:443 ln n. Let A denote the event that n is prime. By the prime number theorem (Theorem 31.37), the probability that n is prime is approximately Pr fAg  1= ln n  1:443=ˇ : Now let B denote the event that MILLER-RABIN returns PRIME. We have that Pr ˚ B j A  D 0 (or equivalently, that Pr fB j Ag D 1) and Pr ˚ B j A  හ 2 s (or equivalently, that Pr ˚ B j A  > 1  2 s ). But what is Pr fA j B g, the probability that n is prime, given that MILLER- RABIN has returned PRIME? By the alternate form of Bayes’s theorem (equa- tion (C.20) on page 1189) and approximating Pr ˚ B j A  by 2 s , we have Pr fA j B g D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag C Pr ˚ A  Pr ˚ B j A   .1= ln n/  1 .1= ln n/  1 C .1  1= ln n/  2 s  1 1 C 2 s .ln n  1/ : This probability does not exceed 1=2 until s exceeds lg.ln n  1/. Intuitively, that many initial trials are needed just for the conûdence derived from failing to ûnd a witness to the compositeness of n to overcome the prior bias in favor of n being composite. For a number with ˇ D 1024 bits, this initial testing requires about lg.ln n  1/  lg.ˇ=1:443/  9 trials. In any case, choosing s D 50 should sufûce for almost any imaginable application. In fact, the situation is much better. If you are trying to ûnd large primes by applying MILLER-RABIN to large randomly chosen odd integers, then choosing a small value of s (say 3) is unlikely to lead to erroneous results, though we won’t prove it here. The reason is that for a randomly chosen odd composite integer n, the expected number of nonwitnesses to the compositeness of n is likely to be considerably smaller than .n  1/=2. Problems for Chapter 31 953 If the integer n is not chosen randomly, however, the best that can be proven is that the number of nonwitnesses is at most .n  1/=4, using an improved version of Theorem 31.39. Furthermore, there do exist integers n for which the number of nonwitnesses is .n  1/=4. Exercises 31.8-1 Prove that if an odd integer n > 1 is not a prime or a prime power, then there exists a nontrivial square root of 1, modulo n. ? 31.8-2 It is possible to strengthen Euler’s theorem (Theorem 31.30) slightly to the form a .n/ D 1 .mod n/ for all a 2 Z  n ; where n D p e 1 1    p e r r and �.n/ is deûned by �.n/ D lcm.�.p e 1 1 /; : : : ; �.p e r r // : Prove that �.n/ j �.n/.

Problems 31-1 Binary gcd algorithm Most computers can perform the operations of subtraction, testing the parity (odd or even) of a binary integer, and halving more quickly than computing remainders.

How many arithmetic operations does your algorithm require on aver- age? Chapter notes Knuth [260] contains a good discussion of algorithms for ûnding the greatest com- mon divisor, as well as other basic number-theoretic algorithms. Dixon [121] gives an overview of factorization and primality testing. Bach [33], Riesel [378], and Bach and Shallit [34] provide overviews of the basics of computational number theory; Shoup [411] provides a more recent survey. The conference proceedings edited by Pomerance [362] contains several excellent survey articles. Knuth [260] discusses the origin of Euclid’s algorithm. It appears in Book 7, Propositions 1 and 2, of the Greek mathematician Euclid’s Elements, which was written around 300 B. C. E. Euclid’s description may have been derived from an algorithm due to Eudoxus around 375 B. C. E. Euclid’s algorithm may hold the honor of being the oldest nontrivial algorithm, rivaled only by an algorithm for multiplication known to the ancient Egyptians. Shallit [407] chronicles the history of the analysis of Euclid’s algorithm. Knuth attributes a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem (Theo- rem 31.27) to the Chinese mathematician Sun-Ts˘ u, who lived sometime between 200 B. C. E. and 200 C. E.4the date is quite uncertain. The same special case was given by the Greek mathematician Nichomachus around 100 C. E. It was general- ized by Qin Jiushao in 1247. The Chinese remainder theorem was ûnally stated and proved in its full generality by L. Euler in 1734. The randomized primality-testing algorithm presented here is due to Miller [327] and Rabin [373] and is the fastest randomized primality-testing algorithm known, 956 Chapter 31 Number-Theoretic Algorithms to within constant factors. The proof of Theorem 31.40 is a slight adaptation of one suggested by Bach [32]. A proof of a stronger result for MILLER-RABIN was given by Monier [332, 333]. For many years primality-testing was the classic example of a problem where randomization appeared to be necessary to obtain an efûcient (polynomial-time) algorithm. In 2002, however, Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena [4] surprised everyone with their deterministic polynomial-time primality- testing algorithm. Until then, the fastest deterministic primality testing algorithm known, due to Cohen and Lenstra [97], ran in .lg n/ O.lg lg lg n/ time on input n, which is just slightly superpolynomial. Nonetheless, for practical purposes, randomized primality-testing algorithms remain more efûcient and are generally preferred. Beauchemin, Brassard, Cr´ epeau, Goutier, and Pomerance [40] nicely discuss the problem of ûnding large <random= primes. The concept of a public-key cryptosystem is due to Difûe and Hellman [115]. The RSA cryptosystem was proposed in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman [380]. Since then, the ûeld of cryptography has blossomed. Our understanding of the RSA cryptosystem has deepened, and modern implementations use signiûcant reûnements of the basic techniques presented here. In addition, many new tech- niques have been developed for proving cryptosystems to be secure. For example, Goldwasser and Micali [190] show that randomization can be an effective tool in the design of secure public-key encryption schemes. For signature schemes, Gold- wasser, Micali, and Rivest [191] present a digital-signature scheme for which every conceivable type of forgery is provably as difûcult as factoring. Katz and Lindell [253] provide an overview of modern cryptography. The best algorithms for factoring large numbers have a running time that grows roughly exponentially with the cube root of the length of the number n to be fac- tored. The general number-ûeld sieve factoring algorithm (as developed by Buh- ler, Lenstra, and Pomerance [77] as an extension of the ideas in the number-ûeld sieve factoring algorithm by Pollard [360] and Lenstra et al. [295] and reûned by Coppersmith [102] and others) is perhaps the most efûcient such algorithm in gen- eral for large inputs. Although it is difûcult to give a rigorous analysis of this algorithm, under reasonable assumptions we can derive a running-time estimate of L.1=3; n/ 1:902Co.1/ , where L.˛; n/ D e .ln n/ ˛ .ln ln n/ 1˛ . The elliptic-curve method due to Lenstra [296] may be more effective for some inputs than the number-ûeld sieve method, since it can ûnd a small prime fac- tor p quite quickly. With this method, the time to ûnd p is estimated to be L.1=2; p/ p 2Co.1/ . 32 String Matching Text-editing programs frequently need to ûnd all occurrences of a pattern in the text. Typically, the text is a document being edited, and the pattern searched for is a particular word supplied by the user. Efûcient algorithms for this problem 4called <string matching=4can greatly aid the responsiveness of the text-editing program. Among their many other applications, string-matching algorithms search for particular patterns in DNA sequences. Internet search engines also use them to ûnd web pages relevant to queries. The string-matching problem can be stated formally as follows. The text is given as an array T Œ1 W n� of length n, and the pattern is an array P Œ1 W m� of length m හ n. The elements of P and T are characters drawn from an alphabet †, which is a ûnite set of characters. For example, † could be the set f0; 1g, or it could be the set fa; b; : : : ; zg. The character arrays P and T are often called strings of characters. As Figure 32.1 shows, pattern P occurs with shift s in text T (or, equivalently, that pattern P occurs beginning at position s C 1 in text T ) if 0 හ s හ n  m and T Œs C 1 W s C m� D P Œ1 W m�, that is, if T Œs C j � D P Œj �, for 1 හ j හ m. If P occurs with shift s in T , then s is a valid shift, and otherwise, s is an invalid shift. The string-matching problem is the problem of ûnding all valid shifts with which a given pattern P occurs in a given text T . a b c a b a a b c a b a c a b a a pattern P text T s = 3 Figure 32.1 An example of the string-matching problem to ûnd all occurrences of the pattern P D abaa in the text T D abcabaabcabac. The pattern occurs only once in the text, at shift s D 3, which is a valid shift. A vertical line connects each character of the pattern to its matching character in the text, and all matched characters are shaded blue. 958 Chapter 32 String Matching Except for the naive brute-force algorithm in Section 32.1, each string-matching algorithm in this chapter performs some preprocessing based on the pattern and then ûnds all valid shifts. We call this latter phase <matching.= Here are the pre- processing and matching times for each of the string-matching algorithms in this chapter. The total running time of each algorithm is the sum of the preprocessing and matching times: Algorithm Preprocessing time Matching time Naive 0 O..n  m C 1/m/ Rabin-Karp ‚.m/ O..n  m C 1/m/ Finite automaton O.m j†j/ ‚.n/ Knuth-Morris-Pratt ‚.m/ ‚.n/ Sufûx array 1 O.n lg n/ O.m lg n C km/ Section 32.2 presents an interesting string-matching algorithm, due to Rabin and Karp. Although the ‚..n  m C 1/m/ worst-case running time of this algorithm is no better than that of the naive method, it works much better on average and in practice. It also generalizes nicely to other pattern-matching problems. Sec- tion 32.3 then describes a string-matching algorithm that begins by constructing a ûnite automaton speciûcally designed to search for occurrences of the given pat- tern P in a text. This algorithm takes O.m j†j/ preprocessing time, but only ‚.n/ matching time. Section 32.4 presents the similar, but much cleverer, Knuth-Morris- Pratt (or KMP) algorithm, which has the same ‚.n/ matching time, but it reduces the preprocessing time to only ‚.m/. A completely different approach appears in Section 32.5, which examines sufûx arrays and the longest common preûx array. You can use these arrays not only to ûnd a pattern in a text, but also to answer other questions, such as what is the longest repeated substring in the text and what is the longest common substring between two texts. The algorithm to form the sufûx array in Section 32.5 takes O.n lg n/ time and, given the sufûx array, the section shows how to compute the longest common preûx array in O.n/ time. Notation and terminology We denote by †  (read <sigma-star=) the set of all ûnite-length strings formed using characters from the alphabet †. This chapter considers only ûnite-length 1 For sufûx arrays, the preprocessing time of O.n lg n/ comes from the algorithm presented in Sec- tion 32.5. It can be reduced to ‚.n/ by using the algorithm in Problem 32-2. The factor k in the matching time denotes the number of occurrences of the pattern in the text.

The concatenation of two strings x and y , denoted xy , has length jx j C jy j and consists of the characters from x followed by the characters from y . A string w is a preûx of a string x , denoted w g x , if x D wy for some string y 2 †  . Note that if w g x , then jwj හ jx j. Similarly, a string w is a sufûx of a string x , denoted w h x , if x D yw for some y 2 †  . As with a preûx, w h x implies jwj හ jx j. For example, ab g abcca and cca h abcca. A string w is a proper preûx of x if w g x and jwj < jx j, and likewise for a proper sufûx. The empty string \" is both a sufûx and a preûx of every string. For any strings x and y and any character a, we have x h y if and only if xa h ya. The g and h relations are transitive. The following lemma will be useful later. Lemma 32.1 (Overlapping-sufûx lemma) Suppose that x , y , and ´ are strings such that x h ´ and y h ´. If jx j හ jy j, then x h y . If jx j  jy j, then y h x . If jx j D jy j, then x D y . Proof See Figure 32.2 for a graphical proof. For convenience, denote the k-character preûx P Œ1 W k� of the pattern P Œ1 W m� by P Œ W k�. Thus, we can write P Œ W 0� D \" and P Œ W m� D P D P Œ1 W m�. Similarly, denote the k-character preûx of the text T by T Œ W k�. Using this notation, we 960 Chapter 32 String Matching can state the string-matching problem as that of ûnding all shifts s in the range 0 හ s හ n  m such that P h T Œ W s C m�. Our pseudocode allows two equal-length strings to be compared for equality as a primitive operation. If the strings are compared from left to right and the comparison stops when a mismatch is discovered, we assume that the time taken by such a test is a linear function of the number of matching characters discovered. To be precise, the test <x == y = is assumed to take ‚.t/ time, where t is the length of the longest string ´ such that ´ g x and ´ g y . 32.1 The naive string-matching algorithm The NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER procedure ûnds all valid shifts using a loop that checks the condition P Œ1 W m� D T Œs C 1 W s C m� for each of the n  m C 1 possible values of s . NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER .T; P; n; m/ 1 for s D 0 to n  m 2 if P Œ1 W m� == T Œs C 1 W s C m� 3 print <Pattern occurs with shift= s Figure 32.3 portrays the naive string-matching procedure as sliding a <template= containing the pattern over the text, noting for which shifts all of the characters on the template equal the corresponding characters in the text. The for loop of lines 133 considers each possible shift explicitly. The test in line 2 determines whether the current shift is valid. This test implicitly loops to check corresponding character positions until all positions match successfully or a mismatch is found. Line 3 prints out each valid shift s . Procedure NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER takes O..n  m C 1/m/ time, and this bound is tight in the worst case. For example, consider the text string a n (a string of n a’s) and the pattern a m . For each of the n  m C1 possible values of the shift s , the implicit loop on line 2 to compare corresponding characters must execute m times to validate the shift. The worst-case running time is thus ‚..n  m C 1/m/, which is ‚.n 2 / if m D bn=2c. Because it requires no preprocessing, NAIVE- STRING-MATCHER’s running time equals its matching time. NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER is far from an optimal procedure for this problem. Indeed, this chapter will show that the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is much better in the worst case. The naive string-matcher is inefûcient because it entirely ignores information gained about the text for one value of s when it considers other values of s . Such information can be quite valuable, however. For example, if P D aaab 32.1 The naive string-matching algorithm 961 a c a a b c a a b s = 0 (a) a c a a b c a a b s = 1 (b) a c a a b c a a b s = 2 (c) a c a a b c a a b s = 3 (d) Figure 32.3 The operation of the NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER procedure for the pattern P D aab and the text T D acaabc. Imagine the pattern P as a template that slides next to the text. (a)–(d) The four successive alignments tried by the naive string matcher. In each part, vertical lines connect corresponding regions found to match (shown in blue), and a red jagged line connects the ûrst mismatched character found, if any. The algorithm ûnds one occurrence of the pattern, at shift s D 2, shown in part (c). and s D 0 is valid, then none of the shifts 1, 2, or 3 are valid, since T Œ4� D b. The following sections examine several ways to make effective use of this sort of information. Exercises 32.1-1 Show the comparisons the naive string matcher makes for the pattern P D 0001 in the text T D 000010001010001 . 32.1-2 Suppose that all characters in the pattern P are different. Show how to accelerate NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER to run in O.n/ time on an n-character text T . 32.1-3 Suppose that pattern P and text T are randomly chosen strings of length m and n, respectively, from the d -ary alphabet † d D f0; 1; : : : ; d  1g, where d  2. Show that the expected number of character-to-character comparisons made by the im- plicit loop in line 2 of the naive algorithm is .n  m C 1/ 1  d m 1  d 1 හ 2.n  m C 1/ over all executions of this loop. (Assume that the naive algorithm stops comparing characters for a given shift once it ûnds a mismatch or matches the entire pattern.) Thus, for randomly chosen strings, the naive algorithm is quite efûcient. 32.1-4 Suppose that the pattern P may contain occurrences of a gap character } that can match an arbitrary string of characters (even one of 0 length). For example, the pattern ab}ba}c occurs in the text cabccbacbacab as 962 Chapter 32 String Matching c ab ’ ab cc ’ } ba ’ ba cba “ } c ’ c ab and as ab ’ ab ccbac — } ba ’ ba ’ } c ’ c ab : The gap character may occur an arbitrary number of times in the pattern but not at all in the text. Give a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether such a pattern P occurs in a given text T , and analyze the running time of your algorithm. 32.2 The Rabin-Karp algorithm Rabin and Karp proposed a string-matching algorithm that performs well in prac- tice and that also generalizes to other algorithms for related problems, such as two-dimensional pattern matching. The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses ‚.m/ prepro- cessing time, and its worst-case running time is ‚..n  m C 1/m/. Based on certain assumptions, however, its average-case running time is better. This algorithm makes use of elementary number-theoretic notions such as the equivalence of two numbers modulo a third number. You might want to refer to Section 31.1 for the relevant deûnitions. For expository purposes, let’s assume that † D f0; 1; 2; : : : ; 9g, so that each character is a decimal digit. (In the general case, you can assume that each char- acter is a digit in radix-d notation, so that it has a numerical value in the range 0 to d 1, where d D j†j.) You can then view a string of k consecutive characters as representing a length-k decimal number. For example, the character string 31415 corresponds to the decimal number 31,415. Because we interpret the input char- acters as both graphical symbols and digits, it will be convenient in this section to denote them as digits in standard text font. Given a pattern P Œ1 W m�, let p denote its corresponding decimal value. In a similar manner, given a text T Œ1 W n�, let t s denote the decimal value of the length-m substring T Œs C 1 W s C m�, for s D 0; 1; : : : ; n  m. Certainly, t s D p if and only if T Œs C 1 W s C m� D P Œ1 W m�, and thus, s is a valid shift if and only if t s D p. If you could compute p in ‚.m/ time and all the t s values in a total of ‚.n  m C 1/ time, 2 then you could determine all valid shifts s in ‚.m/ C ‚.n  m C 1/ D ‚.n/ 2 We write ‚.n  m C 1/ instead of ‚.n  m/ because s takes on n  m C 1 different values. The <C1= is signiûcant in an asymptotic sense because when m D n, computing the lone t s value takes ‚.1/ time, not ‚.0/ time. 32.2 The Rabin-Karp algorithm 963 time by comparing p with each of the t s values. (For the moment, let’s not worry about the possibility that p and the t s values might be very large numbers.) Indeed, you can compute p in ‚.m/ time using Horner’s rule (see Problem 2-3): p D P Œm� C 10  P Œm  1� C 10 ã P Œm  2� C    C 10.P Œ2� C 10P Œ1�/    ä Í : Similarly, you can compute t 0 from T Œ1 W m� in ‚.m/ time. To compute the remaining values t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t nm in ‚.n  m/ time, observe that you can compute t sC1 from t s in constant time, since t sC1 D 10 .t s  10 m1 T Œs C 1�/ C T Œs C m C 1� : (32.1) Subtracting 10 m1 T Œs C 1� removes the high-order digit from t s , multiplying the result by 10 shifts the number left by one digit position, and adding T Œs C m C 1� brings in the appropriate low-order digit. For example, suppose that m D 5, t s D 31415, and the new low-order digit is T Œs C 5 C 1� D 2. The high-order digit to remove is T Œs C 1� D 3, and so t sC1 D 10 .31415  10000  3/ C 2 D 14152 : If you precompute the constant 10 m1 (which you can do in O.lg m/ time us- ing the techniques of Section 31.6, although for this application a straightforward O.m/-time method sufûces), then each execution of equation (32.1) takes a con- stant number of arithmetic operations. Thus, you can compute p in ‚.m/ time, and you can compute all of t 0 ; t 1 ; : : : ; t nm in ‚.n  m C 1/ time. Therefore, you can ûnd all occurrences of the pattern P Œ1 W m� in the text T Œ1 W n� with ‚.m/ preprocessing time and ‚.n  m C 1/ matching time. This scheme works well if P is short enough and the alphabet † is small enough that arithmetic operations on p and t s take constant time. But what if P is long, or if the size of † means that instead of powers of 10 in equation (32.1) you have to use powers of a larger number (such as powers of 256 for the extended ASCII character set)? Then the values of p and t s might be too large to work with in constant time. Fortunately, this problem can be solved, as Figure 32.4 shows: compute p and the t s values modulo a suitable modulus q. You can compute p modulo q in ‚.m/ time and all the t s values modulo q in ‚.n  m C 1/ time. With j†j D 10, if you choose the modulus q as a prime such that 10 q just ûts within one computer word, then you can perform all the necessary computations with single-precision arithmetic. In general, with a d -ary alphabet f0; 1; : : : ; d  1g, choose q so that dq ûts within a computer word and adjust the recurrence equation (32.1) to work modulo q, so that it becomes t sC1 D ã d.t s  T Œs C 1�h/ C T Œs C m C 1� ä mod q ; (32.2) 964 Chapter 32 String Matching 2 3 5 9 0 2 3 1 4 1 5 2 6 7 3 9 9 2 1 7 (a) mod 13 2 3 5 9 0 2 3 1 4 1 5 2 6 7 3 9 9 2 1 7 (b) mod 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 8 9 3 11 0 1 8 5 11 9 11 7 10 4 valid match spurious hit … … … 3 1 4 1 5 2 7 8 old high-order digit new low-order digit = (31415 3 3·10000)·10 + 2 (mod 13) old high-order digit new low-order digit shift = (7 3 3·3)·10 + 2 (mod 13) = 8 (mod 13) (c) 14152 Figure 32.4 The Rabin-Karp algorithm.

Dropping the high-order digit 3, shifting left (multiplying by 10), and then adding in the low-order digit 2 gives the new value 14152.

On the other hand, if t s ¤ p .mod q/, then you deûnitely know that t s ¤ p, so that shift s is invalid. Thus you can use the test t s D p .mod q/ as a fast heuristic test to rule out invalid shifts. If t s D p .mod q/4a hit4then you need to test further to see whether s is really valid or you just have a spurious hit. This additional test explicitly checks the condition P Œ1 W m� D T Œs C 1 W s C m�. If q is large enough, then you would hope that spurious hits occur infrequently enough that the cost of the extra checking is low. The procedure RABIN-KARP-MATCHER on the next page makes these ideas precise. The inputs to the procedure are the text T , the pattern P , their lengths n and m, the radix d to use (which is typically taken to be j†j), and the prime q to use. The procedure works as follows. All characters are interpreted as radix-d digits. The subscripts on t are provided only for clarity: the procedure works correctly if all the subscripts are dropped. Line 1 initializes h to the value of the high-order digit position of an m-digit window. Lines 236 compute p as the value of P Œ1 W m� mod q and t 0 as the value of T Œ1 W m� mod q. The for loop of lines 7312 iterates through all possible shifts s , maintaining the following invariant: Whenever line 8 is executed, t s D T Œs C 1 W s C m� mod q. If a hit occurs because p D t s in line 8, then line 9 determines whether s is a valid shift or the hit was spurious via the test P Œ1 W m� == T Œs C 1 W s C m�. Line 10 prints out any valid shifts that are found. If s < n  m (checked in line 11), then the for loop will iterate at least one more time, and so line 12 ûrst executes to ensure that the loop invariant holds upon the next iteration. Line 12 computes the value of t sC1 mod q from the value of t s mod q in constant time using equation (32.2) directly. RABIN-KARP-MATCHER takes ‚.m/ preprocessing time, and its matching time is ‚..n  m C 1/m/ in the worst case, since (like the naive string-matching algo- rithm) the Rabin-Karp algorithm explicitly veriûes every valid shift. If P D a m and T D a n , then verifying takes ‚..n mC1/m/ time, since each of the n mC1 possible shifts is valid. In many applications, you expect few valid shifts4perhaps some constant c of them. In such applications, the expected matching time of the algorithm is only O..n  m C 1/ C cm/ D O.n C m/, plus the time required to process spurious hits. We can base a heuristic analysis on the assumption that reducing values modulo q acts like a random mapping from †  to Z q . The expected number of spurious hits is then O.n=q/, because we can estimate the chance that an arbitrary t s will be equivalent to p, modulo q, as 1=q. Since there are O.n/ positions at which the 966 Chapter 32 String Matching RABIN-KARP-MATCHER .T; P; n; m; d; q/ 1 h D d m1 mod q 2 p D 0 3 t 0 D 0 4 for i D 1 to m // preprocessing 5 p D .dp C P Œi �/ mod q 6 t 0 D .dt 0 C T Œi �/ mod q 7 for s D 0 to n  m // matching4try all possible shifts 8 if p == t s // a hit? 9 if P Œ1 W m� == T Œs C 1 W s C m� // valid shift? 10 print <Pattern occurs with shift= s 11 if s < n  m 12 t sC1 D ã d.t s  T Œs C 1�h/ C T Œs C m C 1� ä mod q test of line 8 fails (actually, at most n  m C 1 positions) and checking each hit takes O.m/ time in line 9, the expected matching time taken by the Rabin-Karp algorithm is O.n/ C O.m.v C n=q// ; where v is the number of valid shifts. This running time is O.n/ if v D O.1/ and you choose q  m. That is, if the expected number of valid shifts is small (O.1/) and you choose the prime q to be larger than the length of the pattern, then you can expect the Rabin-Karp procedure to use only O.n C m/ matching time. Since m හ n, this expected matching time is O.n/. Exercises 32.2-1 Working modulo q D 11, how many spurious hits does the Rabin-Karp matcher en- counter in the text T D 3141592653589793 when looking for the pattern P D 26? 32.2-2 Describe how to extend the Rabin-Karp method to the problem of searching a text string for an occurrence of any one of a given set of k patterns. Start by assuming that all k patterns have the same length. Then generalize your solution to allow the patterns to have different lengths. 32.2-3 Show how to extend the Rabin-Karp method to handle the problem of looking for a given m  m pattern in an n  n array of characters. (The pattern may be shifted vertically and horizontally, but it may not be rotated.) 32.3 String matching with ﬁnite automata 967 32.2-4 Alice has a copy of a long n-bit ûle A D ha n1 ; a n2 ; : : : ; a 0 i, and Bob similarly has an n-bit ûle B D hb n1 ; b n2 ; : : : ; b 0 i. Alice and Bob wish to know if their ûles are identical. To avoid transmitting all of A or B , they use the following fast probabilistic check. Together, they select a prime q > 1000n and randomly select an integer x from f0; 1; : : : ; q  1g.

(Hint: See Exercise 31.4-4.) 32.3 String matching with ûnite automata Many string-matching algorithms build a ûnite automaton4a simple machine for processing information4that scans the text string T for all occurrences of the pat- tern P . This section presents a method for building such an automaton. These string-matching automata are efûcient: they examine each text character exactly once, taking constant time per text character. The matching time used4after pre- processing the pattern to build the automaton4is therefore ‚.n/. The time to build the automaton, however, can be large if † is large. Section 32.4 describes a clever way around this problem. We begin this section with the deûnition of a ûnite automaton. We then examine a special string-matching automaton and show how to use it to ûnd occurrences of a pattern in a text. Finally, we’ll see how to construct the string-matching automaton for a given input pattern. Finite automata A ûnite automaton M , illustrated in Figure 32.5, is a 5-tuple .Q; q 0 ; A; †; ı/, where Q is a ûnite set of states,  q 0 2 Q is the start state,  A ෂ Q is a distinguished set of accepting states,  † is a ûnite input alphabet,  ı is a function from Q  † into Q, called the transition function of M . 968 Chapter 32 String Matching 1 0 0 0 a b input state 0 (a) a a b b (b) 0 1 Figure 32.5 A simple two-state ûnite automaton with state set Q D f0; 1g, start state q 0 D 0, and input alphabet † D fa; bg. (a) A tabular representation of the transition function ı. (b) An equivalent state-transition diagram. State 1, in orange, is the only accepting state. Directed edges represent transitions. For example, the edge from state 1 to state 0 labeled b indicates that ı.1; b/ D 0. This automaton accepts those strings that end in an odd number of a’s. More precisely, it accepts a string x if and only if x D y´, where y D \" or y ends with a b, and ´ D a k , where k is odd. For example, on input abaaa, including the start state, this automaton enters the sequence of states h0; 1; 0; 1; 0; 1i, and so it accepts this input. For input abbaa, it enters the sequence of states h0; 1; 0; 0; 1; 0i, and so it rejects this input. The ûnite automaton begins in state q 0 and reads the characters of its input string one at a time. If the automaton is in state q and reads input character a, it moves (<makes a transition=) from state q to state ı.q; a/. Whenever its current state q is a member of A, the machine M has accepted the string read so far. An input that is not accepted is rejected. A ûnite automaton M induces a function �, called the ûnal-state function, from †  to Q such that �.w/ is the state M ends up in after reading the string w. Thus, M accepts a string w if and only if �.w/ 2 A. We deûne the function � recursively, using the transition function: �.\"/ D q 0 ; �.wa/ D ı.�.w/; a/ for w 2 †  ; a 2 † . String-matching automata For a given pattern P , a preprocessing step constructs a string-matching automaton speciûc to P . The automaton then searches the text string for occurrences of P . Figure 32.6 illustrates the automaton for the pattern P D ababaca. From now on, let’s assume that P is ûxed, and for brevity, we won’t bother to indicate the dependence upon P in our notation. In order to specify the string-matching automaton corresponding to a given pat- tern P Œ1 W m�, we ûrst deûne an auxiliary function � , called the sufûx function corresponding to the pattern P . The function � maps †  to f0; 1; : : : ; mg such that � .x/ is the length of the longest preûx of P that is also a sufûx of x : � .x/ D max fk W P Œ W k� h x g : (32.3) 32.3 String matching with ﬁnite automata 969 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a b a b a c a b a a a a b (a) 1 0 0 1 2 0 3 0 0 1 4 0 5 0 0 1 4 6 7 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 4 5 6 7 state input a b c a b a b a c a P (b) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 a b a b a b a c a b a 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 5 6 7 2 3 4 4 (c) i T Œi� state �.T i / Figure 32.6 (a) A state-transition diagram for the string-matching automaton that accepts all strings ending in the string ababaca. State 0 is the start state, and state 7 (in orange) is the only ac- cepting state. The transition function ı is deûned by equation (32.4), and a directed edge from state i to state j labeled a represents ı.i; a/ D j . The right-going edges forming the <spine= of the automa- ton, shown in blue, correspond to successful matches between pattern and input characters. Except for the edges from state 7 to states 1 and 2, the left-going edges correspond to mismatches. Some edges corresponding to mismatches are omitted: by convention, if a state i has no outgoing edge la- beled a for some a 2 †, then ı.i; a/ D 0. (b) The corresponding transition function ı, and the pattern string P D ababaca. The entries corresponding to successful matches between pattern and input characters are shown in blue. (c) The operation of the automaton on the text T D abababacaba. Under each text character T Œi� appears the state �.T Œ W i�/ that the automaton is in after processing the preûx T Œ W i�. The substring of the pattern that occurs in the text is highlighted in blue. The automaton ûnds this one occurrence of the pattern, ending in position 9. The sufûx function � is well deûned since the empty string P Œ W 0� D \" is a suf- ûx of every string. As examples, for the pattern P D ab, we have � .\"/ D 0, � .ccaca/ D 1, and � .ccab/ D 2. For a pattern P of length m, we have � .x/ D m if and only if P h x . From the deûnition of the sufûx function, x h y implies � .x/ හ � .y/ (see Exercise 32.3-4). We are now ready to deûne the string-matching automaton that corresponds to a given pattern P Œ1 W m�: 970 Chapter 32 String Matching  The state set Q is f0; 1; : : : ; mg. The start state q 0 is state 0, and state m is the only accepting state.  The transition function ı is deûned, for any state q and character a, by ı.q; a/ D � .P Œ W q�a/ : (32.4) As the automaton consumes characters of the text T , it is trying to build a match of the pattern P against the most recently seen characters of T . At any time, the state number q gives the length of the longest preûx of P that matches the most recently seen text characters. Whenever the automaton reaches state m, the m most recently seen text characters match the ûrst m characters of P . Since P has length m, reaching state m means that the m most recently seen text characters match the entire pattern, so that the automaton has found a match. With this intuition behind the design of the automaton, here is the reasoning be- hind deûning ı.q; a/ D � .P Œ W q�a/. Suppose that the automaton is in state q after reading the ûrst i characters of the text, that is, q D �.T Œ W i �/. The intuitive idea then says that q also equals the length of the longest preûx of P that matches a sufûx of T Œ W i � or, equivalently, that q D � .T Œ W i �/. Thus, since �.T Œ W i �/ and � .T Œ W i �/ both equal q, we will see (in Theorem 32.4 on page 973) that the automaton maintains the following invariant: �.T Œ W i �/ D � .T Œ W i �/ : (32.5) If the automaton is in state q and reads the next character T Œi C 1� D a, then the transition should lead to the state corresponding to the longest preûx of P that is a sufûx of T Œ W i �a. That state is � .T Œ W i �a/, and equation (32.5) gives �.T Œ W i �a/ D � .T Œ W i �a/. Because P Œ W q� is the longest preûx of P that is a sufûx of T Œ W i �, the longest preûx of P that is a sufûx of T Œ W i �a has length not only � .T Œ W i �a/, but also � .P Œ W q�a/, and so �.T Œ W i �a/ D � .P Œ W q�a/. (Lemma 32.3 on page 972 will prove that � .T Œ W i �a/ D � .P Œ W q�a/.) Thus, when the automaton is in state q, the transition function ı on character a should take the automaton to state ı.q; a/ D ı.�.T Œ W i �/; a/ D �.T Œ W i �a/ D � .P Œ W q�a/ (with the last equality following from equation (32.5)). There are two cases to consider, depending on whether the next character con- tinues to match the pattern. In the ûrst case, a D P Œq C 1�, so that the charac- ter a continues to match the pattern. In this case, because ı.q; a/ D q C 1, the transition continues to go along the <spine= of the automaton (the blue edges in Figure 32.6(a)). In the second case, a ¤ P Œq C 1�, so that a does not extend the match being built. In this case, we need to ûnd the longest preûx of P that is also a sufûx of T Œ W i �a, which will have length at most q. The preprocessing step matches the pattern against itself when creating the string-matching automaton, so that the transition function can quickly identify the longest such smaller preûx of P . 32.3 String matching with ﬁnite automata 971 Let’s look at an example. Consider state 5 in the string-matching automaton of Figure 32.6. In state 5, the ûve most recently read characters of T are ababa, the characters along the spine of the automaton that reach state 5. If the next character of T is c, then the most recently read characters of T are ababac, which is the preûx of P with length 6. The automaton should continue along the spine to state 6. This is the ûrst case, in which the match continues, and ı.5; c/ D 6. To illustrate the second case, suppose that in state 5, the next character of T is b, so the most recently read characters of T are ababab. Here, the longest preûx of P that matches the most recently read characters of T 4that is, a sufûx of the portion of T read so far4is abab, with length 4, so ı.5; b/ D 4. To clarify the operation of a string-matching automaton, the simple and efû- cient procedure FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER simulates the behavior of such an automaton (represented by its transition function ı ) in ûnding occurrences of a pattern P of length m in an input text T Œ1 W n�. As for any string-matching au- tomaton for a pattern of length m, the state set Q is f0; 1; : : : ; mg, the start state is 0, and the only accepting state is state m. From the simple loop structure of FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER, you can see that its matching time on a text string of length n is ‚.n/, assuming that each lookup of the transition function ı takes constant time. This matching time, however, does not include the prepro- cessing time required to compute the transition function. We address this problem later, after ûrst proving that the procedure FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER oper- ates correctly. FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER .T; ı; n; m/ 1 q D 0 2 for i D 1 to n 3 q D ı.q; T Œi �/ 4 if q == m 5 print <Pattern occurs with shift= i  m Let’s examine how the automaton operates on an input text T Œ1 W n�. We will prove that the automaton is in state � .T Œ W i �/ after reading character T Œi �. Since � .T Œ W i �/ D m if and only if P h T Œ W i �, the machine is in the accepting state m if and only if it has just read the pattern P . We start with two lemmas about the sufûx function � . Lemma 32.2 (Sufûx-function inequality) For any string x and character a, we have � .xa/ හ � .x/ C 1. 972 Chapter 32 String Matching x a P Œ W r� P Œ W r  1� Figure 32.7 An illustration for the proof of Lemma 32.2. The ûgure shows that r හ �.x/ C 1, where r D �.xa/. x a a P Œ W r� P Œ W q� Figure 32.8 An illustration for the proof of Lemma 32.3. The ûgure shows t hat r D �.P Œ W q�a/, where q D �.x/ and r D �.xa/. Proof Referring to Figure 32.7, let r D � .xa/. If r D 0, then the conclusion � .xa/ D r හ � .x/ C1 is trivially satisûed since � .x/ is nonnegative. Now assume that r > 0. Then, P Œ W r� h xa, by the deûnition of � . Thus, P Œ W r  1� h x , by dropping the a from both the end of P Œ W r� and the end of xa. Therefore, r  1 හ � .x/, since � .x/ is the largest k such that P Œ W k� h x , and thus � .xa/ D r හ � .x/ C 1. Lemma 32.3 (Sufûx-function recursion lemma) For any string x and character a, if q D � .x/, then � .xa/ D � .P Œ W q�a/. Proof The deûnition of � gives that P Œ W q� h x . As Figure 32.8 shows, we also have P Œ W q�a h xa. Let r D � .xa/. Then P Œ W r� h xa and, by Lemma 32.2, r හ q C 1. Thus, we have jP Œ W r�j D r හ q C 1 D jP Œ W q�aj. Since P Œ W q�a h xa, P Œ W r� h xa, and jP Œ W r�j හ jP Œ W q�aj, Lemma 32.1 on page 959 implies that P Œ W r� h P Œ W q�a. Therefore, r හ � .P Œ W q�a/, that is, � .xa/ හ � .P Œ W q�a/. But we also have � .P Œ W q�a/ හ � .xa/, since P Œ W q�a h xa. Thus, � .xa/ D � .P Œ W q�a/. 32.3 String matching with ﬁnite automata 973 We are now ready to prove the main theorem characterizing the behavior of a string-matching automaton on a given input text. As noted above, this theorem shows that the automaton is merely keeping track, at each step, of the longest preûx of the pattern that is a sufûx of what has been read so far . In other words, the automaton maintains the invariant (32.5). Theorem 32.4 If � is the ûnal-state function of a string-matching automaton for a given pattern P and T Œ1 W n� is an input text for the automaton, then �.T Œ W i �/ D � .T Œ W i �/ for i D 0; 1; : : : ; n. Proof The proof is by induction on i . For i D 0, the theorem is trivially true, since T Œ W 0� D \". Thus, �.T Œ W 0�/ D 0 D � .T Œ W 0�/. Now assume that �.T Œ W i �/ D � .T Œ W i �/. We will prove that �.T Œ W i C 1�/ D � .T Œ W i C 1�/. Let q denote �.T Œ W i �/, so that q D � .T Œ W i �/, and let a denote T Œi C 1�. Then, �.T Œ W i C 1�/ D �.T Œ W i �a/ (by the deûnitions of T Œ W i C 1� and a) D ı.�.T Œ W i �/; a/ (by the deûnition of �) D ı.q; a/ (by the deûnition of q) D � .P Œ W q�a/ (by the deûnition (32.4) of ı ) D � .T Œ W i �a/ (by Lemma 32.3) D � .T Œ W i C 1�/ (by the deûnition of T Œ W i C 1�) . By Theorem 32.4, if the machine enters state q on line 3, then q is the largest value such that P Œ W q� h T Œ W i �. Thus, in line 4, q D m if and only if the machine has just read an occurrence of the pattern P . Therefore, FINITE-AUTOMATON- MATCHER operates correctly. Computing the transition function The procedure COMPUTE-TRANSITION-FUNCTION on the following page com- putes the transition function ı from a given pattern P Œ1 W m�. It computes ı.q; a/ in a straightforward manner according to its deûnition in equation (32.4). The nested loops beginning on lines 1 and 2 consider all states q and all characters a, and lines 336 set ı.q; a/ to be the largest k such that P Œ W k� h P Œ W q�a. The code starts with the largest conceivable value of k, which is q C1, unless q D m, in which case k cannot be larger than m. It then decreases k until P Œ W k� is a sufûx of P Œ W q�a, which must eventually occur, since P Œ W 0� D \" is a sufûx of every string. 974 Chapter 32 String Matching COMPUTE-TRANSITION-FUNCTION .P; †; m/ 1 for q D 0 to m 2 for each character a 2 † 3 k D min fm; q C 1g 4 while P Œ W k� is not a sufûx of P Œ W q�a 5 k D k  1 6 ı.q; a/ D k 7 return ı The running time of COMPUTE-TRANSITION-FUNCTION is O.m 3 j†j/, be- cause the outer loops contribute a factor of m j†j, the inner while loop can run at most m C 1 times, and the test for whether P Œ W k� is a sufûx of P Œ W q�a on line 4 can require comparing up to m characters. Much faster procedures exist. By utiliz- ing some cleverly computed information about the pattern P (see Exercise 32.4-8), the time required to compute ı from P improves to O.m j†j/. This improved pro- cedure for computing ı provides a way to ûnd all occurrences of a length-m pattern in a length-n text over an alphabet † with O.m j†j/ preprocessing time and ‚.n/ matching time.

De- scribe the state-transition diagram of the string-matching automaton for a nonover- lappable pattern. 32.3-4 Let x and y be preûxes of the pattern P . Prove that x h y implies � .x/ හ � .y/. 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm 975 ? 32.3-5 Given two patterns P and P 0 , describe how to construct a ûnite automaton that determines all occurrences of either pattern. Try to minimize the number of states in your automaton. 32.3-6 Given a pattern P containing gap characters (see Exercise 32.1-4), show how to build a ûnite automaton that can ûnd an occurrence of P in a text T in O.n/ matching time, where n D jT j. ? 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm Knuth, Morris, and Pratt developed a linear-time string matching algorithm that avoids computing the transition function ı altogether. Instead, the KMP algorithm uses an auxiliary function � , which it precomputes from the pattern in ‚.m/ time and stores in an array �Œ1 W m�. The array � allows the algorithm to compute the transition function ı efûciently (in an amortized sense) <on the üy= as needed. Loosely speaking, for any state q D 0; 1; : : : ; m and any character a 2 †, the value �Œq� contains the information needed to compute ı.q; a/ but that does not depend on a. Since the array � has only m entries, whereas ı has ‚.m j†j/ en- tries, the KMP algorithm saves a factor of j†j in the preprocessing time by com- puting � rather than ı . Like the procedure FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER, once preprocessing has completed, the KMP algorithm uses ‚.n/ matching time. The preûx function for a pattern The preûx function � for a pattern encapsulates knowledge about how the pattern matches against shifts of itself. The KMP algorithm takes advantage of this infor- mation to avoid testing useless shifts in the naive pattern-matching algorithm and to avoid precomputing the full transition function ı for a string-matching automaton. Consider the operation of the naive string matcher. Figure 32.9(a) shows a par- ticular shift s of a template containing the pattern P D ababaca against a text T . For this example, q D 5 of the characters have matched successfully, but the 6th pattern character fails to match the corresponding text character. The informa- tion that q characters have matched successfully determines the corresponding text characters. Because these q text characters match, certain shifts must be invalid. In the example of the ûgure, the shift s C 1 is necessarily invalid, since the ûrst pattern character (a) would be aligned with a text character that does not match the ûrst pattern character, but does match the second pattern character (b). The shift 976 Chapter 32 String Matching s 0 D s C 2 shown in part (b) of the ûgure, however, aligns the ûrst three pattern characters with three text characters that necessarily match. More generally, suppose that you know that P Œ W q� h T Œ W s C q� or, equiva- lently, that P Œ1 W q� D T Œs C 1 W s C q�. You want to shift P so that some shorter preûx P Œ W k� of P matches a sufûx of T Œ W s C q�, if possible. You might have more than one choice for how much to shift, however. In Figure 32.9(b), shifting P by 2 positions works, so that P Œ W 3� h T Œ W s C q�, but so does shifting P by 4 positions, so that P Œ W 1� h T Œ W s C q� in Figure 32.9(c). If more than one shift amount works, you should choose the smallest shift amount so that you do not miss any potential matches. Put more precisely, you want to answer this question: Given that pattern characters P Œ1 W q� match text characters T Œs C 1 W s C q� (that is, P Œ W q� h T Œ W s C q�), what is the least shift s 0 > s such that for some k < q, P Œ1 W k� D T Œs 0 C 1 W s 0 C k� ; (32.6) (that is, P Œ W k� h T Œ W s 0 C k�), where s 0 C k D s C q? Here’s another way to look at this question. If you know P Œ W q� h T Œ W s C q�, then how do you ûnd the longest proper preûx P Œ W k� of P Œ W q� that is also a sufûx of T Œ W s C q�? These questions are equivalent because given s and q, requiring s 0 C k D s C q means that ûnding the smallest shift s 0 (2 in Figure 32.9(b)) is tantamount to ûnding the longest preûx length k (3 in Figure 32.9(b)). If you add the difference q  k in the lengths of these preûxes of P to the shift s , you get the new shift s 0 , so that s 0 D s C .q  k/. In the best case, k D 0, so that s 0 D s C q, immediately ruling out shifts s C 1; s C 2; : : : ; s C q  1. In any case, at the new shift s 0 , it is redundant to compare the ûrst k characters of P with the corresponding characters of T , since equation (32.6) guarantees that they match. As Figure 32.9(d) demonstrates, you can precompute the necessary information by comparing the pattern against itself. Since T Œs 0 C 1 W s 0 C k� is part of the matched portion of the text, it is a sufûx of the string P Œ W q�. Therefore, think of equation (32.6) as asking for the greatest k < q such that P Œ W k� h P Œ W q�. Then, the new shift s 0 D s C .q  k/ is the next potentially valid shift. It will be convenient to store, for each value of q, the number k of matching characters at the new shift s 0 , rather than storing, say, the amount s 0  s to shift by. Let’s look at the precomputed information a little more formally. For a given pattern P Œ1 W m�, the preûx function for P is the function � W f1; 2; : : : ; mg ! f0; 1; : : : ; m  1g such that �Œq� D max fk W k < q and P Œ W k� h P Œ W q�g : That is, �Œq� is the length of the longest preûx of P that is a proper sufûx of P Œ W q�. Here is the complete preûx function � for the pattern ababaca: 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm 977 b a c b a b a b a (a) a b a a b c b a b b a c a s T P q b a c b a b a b a (b) a b a a b c b a b b a c a sʹ = s + 2 T P k a b a b a a b a (d) b a c b a b a b a (c) a b a a b c b a b b a c a s + 4 T P P Œ W k� P Œ W q� Figure 32.9 The preûx function � .

(b) Knowing these particular 5 matched characters (P Œ W 5�) sufûces to deduce that a shift of s C 1 is invalid, but that a shift of s 0 D s C 2 is consistent with everything known about the text and therefore is potentially valid. The preûx P Œ W k�, where k D 3, aligns with the text seen so far. (c) A shift of s C 4 is also potentially valid, but it leaves only the preûx P Œ W 1� aligned with the text seen so far. (d) To precompute useful information for such deductions, compare the pattern with itself. Here, the longest preûx of P that is also a proper sufûx of P Œ W 5� is P Œ W 3�. The array � represents this precomputed information, so that �Œ5� D 3.

The procedure follows from FINITE-AUTOMATON- MATCHER for the most part. To compute � , KMP-MATCHER calls the auxiliary procedure COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION. These two procedures have much in common, because both match a string against the pattern P : KMP-MATCHER matches the text T against P , and COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION matches P against itself. Next, let’s analyze the running times of these procedures. Then we’ll prove them correct, which will be more complicated. Running-time analysis The running time of COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION is ‚.m/, which we show by using the aggregate method of amortized analysis (see Section 16.1). The only tricky part is showing that the while loop of lines 536 executes O.m/ times alto- 978 Chapter 32 String Matching KMP-MATCHER .T; P; n; m/ 1 � D COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION .P; m/ 2 q D 0 // number of characters matched 3 for i D 1 to n // scan the text from left to right 4 while q > 0 and P Œq C 1� ¤ T Œi � 5 q D �Œq� // next character does not match 6 if P Œq C 1� == T Œi � 7 q D q C 1 // next character matches 8 if q == m // is all of P matched? 9 print <Pattern occurs with shift= i  m 10 q D �Œq� // look for the next match COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION .P; m/ 1 let �Œ1 W m� be a new array 2 �Œ1� D 0 3 k D 0 4 for q D 2 to m 5 while k > 0 and P Œk C 1� ¤ P Œq� 6 k D �Œk� 7 if P Œk C 1� == P Œq� 8 k D k C 1 9 �Œq� D k 10 return � gether. Starting with some observations about k, we’ll show that it makes at most m1 iterations. First, line 3 starts k at 0, and the only way that k increases is by the increment operation in line 8, which executes at most once per iteration of the for loop of lines 439. Thus, the total increase in k is at most m1. Second, since k < q upon entering the for loop and each iteration of the loop increments q, we always have k < q. Therefore, the assignments in lines 2 and 9 ensure that �Œq� < q for all q D 1; 2; : : : ; m, which means that each iteration of the while loop decreases k. Third, k never becomes negative. Putting these facts together, we see that the total decrease in k from the while loop is bounded from above by the total increase in k over all iterations of the for loop, which is m  1. Thus, the while loop iterates at most m  1 times in all, and COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION runs in ‚.m/ time. Exercise 32.4-4 asks you to show, by a similar aggregate analysis, that the match- ing time of KMP-MATCHER is ‚.n/. 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm 979 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 1 2 3 0 1 a b a b a c a (a) a b a b a c a a b a b a c a a b a b a c a a b a b a c a (b) \" i P Œi� �Œi � P 5 P 3 P 1 P 0 �Œ5� D 3 �Œ3� D 1 �Œ1� D 0 Figure 32.10 An illustration of Lemma 32.5 for the pattern P D ababaca and q D 5.

(b) Sliding the template containing the pattern P to the right and noting when some preûx P Œ W k� of P matches up with some proper sufûx of P Œ W 5�. Matches occur when k D 3, 1, and 0. In the ûgure, the ûrst row gives P , and the vertical red line is drawn just after P Œ W 5�. Successive rows show all the shifts of P that cause some preûx P Œ W k� of P to match some sufûx of P Œ W 5�. Successfully matched characters are shown in blue. Blue lines connect aligned matching characters. Thus, fk W k < 5 and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W 5�g D f3; 1; 0g. Lemma 32.5 claims that �  Œq� D fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g for all q. Compared with FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER, by using � rather than ı , the KMP algorithm reduces the time for preprocessing the pattern from O.m j†j/ to ‚.m/, while keeping the actual matching time bounded by ‚.n/. Correctness of the preﬁx-function computation We’ll see a little later that the preûx function � helps to simulate the transition function ı in a string-matching automaton. But ûrst, we need to prove that the procedure COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION does indeed compute the preûx func- tion correctly. Doing so requires ûnding all preûxes P Œ W k� that are proper sufûxes of a given preûx P Œ W q�. The value of �Œq� gives us the length of the longest such preûx, but the following lemma, illustrated in Figure 32.10, shows that iterating the preûx function � generates all the preûxes P Œ W k� that are proper sufûxes of P Œ W q�. Let  Œq� D ˚ �Œq�; � .2/ Œq�; � .3/ Œq�; : : : ; � .t / Œq�  ; where � .i / Œq� is deûned in terms of functional iteration, so that � .0/ Œq� D q and � .i / Œq� D �Œ� .i 1/ Œq�� for i  1 (so that �Œq� D � .1/ Œq�), and where the sequence in �  Œq� stops upon reaching � .t / Œq� D 0 for some t  1. 980 Chapter 32 String Matching Lemma 32.5 (Preﬁx-function iteration lemma) Let P be a pattern of length m with preûx function � . Then, for q D 1; 2; : : : ; m, we have �  Œq� D fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g. Proof We ûrst prove that �  Œq� ෂ fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g or, equiva- lently, 2 �  Œq� implies P Œ W i � ❂ P Œ W q� : (32.7) If i 2 �  Œq�, then i D � .u/ Œq� for some u > 0. We prove equation (32.7) by induction on u. For u D 1, we have i D �Œq�, and the claim follows since i < q and P Œ W �Œq�� ❂ P Œ W q� by the deûnition of � . Now consider some u  1 such that both � .u/ Œq� and � .uC1/ Œq� belong to �  Œq�. Let i D � .u/ Œq�, so that �Œi � D � .uC1/ Œq�. The inductive hypothesis is that P Œ W i � ❂ P Œ W q�. Because the relations < and ❂ are transitive, we have �Œi � < i < q and P Œ W �Œi �� ❂ P Œ W i � ❂ P Œ W q�, which establishes equation (32.7) for all i in �  Œq�. Therefore, �  Œq� ෂ fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g. We now prove that fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g ෂ �  Œq� by contradiction. Suppose to the contrary that the set fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g  �  Œq� is nonempty, and let j be the largest number in the set. Because �Œq� is the largest value in fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g and �Œq� 2 �  Œq�, it must be the case that j < �Œq�. Having established that �  Œq� contains at least one integer greater than j , let j 0 denote the smallest such integer. (We can choose j 0 D �Œq� if no other number in �  Œq� is greater than j .) We have P Œ W j � ❂ P Œ W q� because j 2 fk W k < q and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q�g, and from j 0 2 �  Œq� and equation (32.7), we have P Œ W j 0 � ❂ P Œ W q�. Thus, P Œ W j � ❂ P Œ W j 0 � by Lemma 32.1, and j is the largest value less than j 0 with this property. Therefore, we must have �Œj 0 � D j and, since j 0 2 �  Œq�, we must have j 2 �  Œq� as well. This contradiction proves the lemma. The algorithm COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION computes �Œq�, in order, for q D 1; 2; : : : ; m. Setting �Œ1� to 0 in line 2 of COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION is cer- tainly correct, since �Œq� < q for all q. We’ll use the following lemma and its corollary to prove that COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION computes �Œq� correctly for q > 1. Lemma 32.6 Let P be a pattern of length m, and let � be the preûx function for P . For q D 1; 2; : : : ; m, if �Œq� > 0, then �Œq�  1 2 �  Œq  1�. Proof Let r D �Œq� > 0, so that r < q and P Œ W r� ❂ P Œ W q�, and thus, r  1 < q  1 and P Œ W r  1� ❂ P Œ W q  1� (by dropping the last character from 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm 981 P Œ W r� and P Œ W q�, which we can do because r > 0). By Lemma 32.5, therefore, r  1 2 �  Œq  1�. Thus, we have �Œq�  1 D r  1 2 �  Œq  1�. For q D 2; 3; : : : ; m, deûne the subset E q1 ෂ �  Œq  1� by E q1 D fk 2 �  Œq  1� W P Œk C 1� D P Œq�g D fk W k < q  1 and P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q  1� and P Œk C 1� D P Œq�g (by Lemma 32.5) D fk W k < q  1 and P Œ W k C 1� ❂ P Œ W q�g : The set E q1 consists of the values k < q  1 for which P Œ W k� ❂ P Œ W q  1� and for which, because P Œk C 1� D P Œq�, we have P Œ W k C 1� ❂ P Œ W q�. Thus, E q1 consists of those values k 2 �  Œq  1� such that extending P Œ W k� to P Œ W k C 1� produces a proper sufûx of P Œ W q�. Corollary 32.7 Let P be a pattern of length m, and let � be the preûx function for P . Then, for q D 2; 3; : : : ; m, �Œq� D ( 0 if E q1 D ; ; 1 C max E q1 if E q1 ¤ ; : Proof If E q1 is empty, there is no k 2 �  Œq  1� (including k D 0) such that extending P Œ W k� to P Œ W k C 1� produces a proper sufûx of P Œ W q�. Therefore, �Œq� D 0. If, instead, E q1 is nonempty, then for each k 2 E q1 , we have k C 1 < q and P Œ W k C 1� ❂ P Œ W q�. Therefore, the deûnition of �Œq� gives �Œq�  1 C max E q1 : (32.8) Note that �Œq� > 0. Let r D �Œq�  1, so that r C 1 D �Œq� > 0, and therefore P Œ W r C 1� ❂ P Œ W q�. If a nonempty string is a sufûx of another, then the two strings must have the same last character. Since r C 1 > 0, the preûx P Œ W r C 1� is nonempty, and so P Œr C 1� D P Œq�. Furthermore, r 2 �  Œq  1� by Lemma 32.6. Therefore, r 2 E q1 , and so �Œq�  1 D r හ max E q1 or, equivalently, �Œq� හ 1 C max E q1 : (32.9) Combining equations (32.8) and (32.9) completes the proof. We now ûnish the proof that COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION computes � cor- rectly. The key is to combine the deûnition of E q1 with the statement of Corol- lary 32.7, so that �Œq� equals 1 plus the greatest value of k in �  Œq  1� such that 982 Chapter 32 String Matching P Œk C 1� D P Œq�. First, in COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION, k D �Œq  1� at the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 439. This condition is enforced by lines 2 and 3 when the loop is ûrst entered, and it remains true in each successive iteration because of line 9. Lines 538 adjust k so that it becomes the correct value of �Œq�. The while loop of lines 536 searches through all values k 2 �  Œq  1� in decreasing order to ûnd the value of �Œq�. The loop terminates either because k reaches 0 or P Œk C 1� D P Œq�. Because the <and= operator short-circuits, if the loop terminates because P Œk C 1� D P Œq�, then k must have also been positive, and so k is the greatest value in E q1 . In this case, lines 739 set �Œq� to k C 1, according to Corollary 32.7. If, instead, the while loop terminates because k D 0, then there are two possibilities. If P Œ1� D P Œq�, then E q1 D f0g, and lines 739 set both k and �Œq� to 1. If k D 0 and P Œ1� ¤ P Œq�, however, then E q1 D ;. In this case, line 9 sets �Œq� to 0, again according to Corollary 32.7, which completes the proof of the correctness of COMPUTE-PREFIX-FUNCTION. Correctness of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm You can think of the procedure KMP-MATCHER as a reimplemented version of the procedure FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER, but using the preûx func- tion � to compute state transitions. Speciûcally, we’ll prove that in the i th iteration of the for loops of both KMP-MATCHER and FINITE-AUTOMATON- MATCHER, the state q has the same value upon testing for equality with m (at line 8 in KMP-MATCHER and at line 4 in FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER). Once we have argued that KMP-MATCHER simulates the behavior of FINITE- AUTOMATON-MATCHER, the correctness of KMP-MATCHER follows from the correctness of FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER (though we’ll see a little later why line 10 in KMP-MATCHER is necessary). Before formally proving that KMP-MATCHER correctly simulates FINITE- AUTOMATON-MATCHER, let’s take a moment to understand how the preûx func- tion � replaces the ı transition function. Recall that when a string-matching automaton is in state q and it scans a character a D T Œi �, it moves to a new state ı.q; a/. If a D P Œq C 1�, so that a continues to match the pattern, then the state number is incremented: ı.q; a/ D q C 1. Otherwise, a ¤ P Œq C 1�, so that a does not continue to match the pattern, and the state number does not increase: 0 හ ı.q; a/ හ q. In the ûrst case, when a continues to match, KMP-MATCHER moves to state q C 1 without referring to the � function: the while loop test in line 4 immediately comes up false, the test in line 6 comes up true, and line 7 increments q. The � function comes into play when the character a does not continue to match the pattern, so that the new state ı.q; a/ is either q or to the left of q along the spine of the automaton. The while loop of lines 435 in KMP-MATCHER iterates through 32.4 The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm 983 the states in �  Œq�, stopping either when it arrives in a state, say q 0 , such that a matches P Œq 0 C 1� or q 0 has gone all the way down to 0. If a matches P Œq 0 C 1�, then line 7 sets the new state to q 0 C1, which should equal ı.q; a/ for the simulation to work correctly. In other words, the new state ı.q; a/ should be either state 0 or a state numbered 1 more than some state in �  Œq�. Let’s look at the example in Figures 32.6 and 32.10, which are for the pattern P D ababaca. Suppose that the automaton is in state q D 5, having matched ababa. The states in �  Œ5� are, in descending order, 3, 1, and 0. If the next char- acter scanned is c, then you can see that the automaton moves to state ı.5; c/ D 6 in both FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER (line 3) and KMP-MATCHER (line 7). Now suppose that the next character scanned is instead b, so that the automaton should move to state ı.5; b/ D 4. The while loop in KMP-MATCHER exits after executing line 5 once, and the automaton arrives in state q 0 D �Œ5� D 3. Since P Œq 0 C 1� D P Œ4� D b, the test in line 6 comes up true, and the automaton moves to the new state q 0 C 1 D 4 D ı.5; b/. Finally, suppose that the next character scanned is instead a, so that the automaton should move to state ı.5; a/ D 1. The ûrst three times that the test in line 4 executes, the test comes up true. The ûrst time ûnds that P Œ6� D c ¤ a, and the automaton moves to state �Œ5� D 3 (the ûrst state in �  Œ5�). The second time ûnds that P Œ4� D b ¤ a, and the automaton moves to state �Œ3� D 1 (the second state in �  Œ5�). The third time ûnds that P Œ2� D b ¤ a, and the automaton moves to state �Œ1� D 0 (the last state in �  Œ5�). The while loop exits once it arrives in state q 0 D 0. Now line 6 ûnds that P Œq 0 C 1� D P Œ1� D a, and line 7 moves the automaton to the new state q 0 C 1 D 1 D ı.5; a/. Thus, the intuition is that KMP-MATCHER iterates through the states in �  Œq� in decreasing order, stopping at some state q 0 and then possibly moving to state q 0 C1. Although that might seem like a lot of work just to simulate computing ı.q; a/, bear in mind that asymptotically, KMP-M ATCHER is no slower than FINITE- AUTOMATON-MATCHER. We are now ready to formally prove the correctness of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. By Theorem 32.4, we have that q D � .T Œ W i �/ after each time line 3 of FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER executes. Therefore, it sufûces to show that the same property holds with regard to the for loop in KMP-MATCHER. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of loop iterations. Initially, both procedures set q to 0 as they enter their respective for loops for the ûrst time. Consider iter- ation i of the for loop in KMP-MATCHER. By the inductive hypothesis, the state number q equals � .T Œ W i  1�/ at the start of the loop iteration. We need to show that when line 8 is reached, the new value of q is � .T Œ W i �/. (Again, we’ll handle line 10 separately.) Considering q to be the state number at the start of the for loop iteration, when KMP-MATCHER considers the character T Œi �, the longest preûx of P that is a sufûx of T Œ W i � is either P Œ W q C 1� (if P Œq C 1� D T Œi �) or some preûx (not 984 Chapter 32 String Matching necessarily proper, and possibly empty) of P Œ W q�. We consider separately the three cases in which � .T Œ W i �/ D 0, � .T Œ W i �/ D q C 1, and 0 < � .T Œ W i �/ හ q.  If � .T Œ W i �/ D 0, then P Œ W 0� D \" is the only preûx of P that is a sufûx of T Œ W i �. The while loop of lines 435 iterates through each value q 0 in �  Œq�, but although P Œ W q 0 � ❂ P Œ W q� ❂ T Œ W i  1� for every q 0 2 �  Œq� (because < are ❂ are tran- sitive relations), the loop never ûnds a q 0 such that P Œq 0 C 1� D T Œi �. The loop terminates when q reaches 0, and of course line 7 does not execute. Therefore, q D 0 at line 8, so that now q D � .T Œ W i �/.  If � .T Œ W i �/ D q C1, then P Œq C1� D T Œi �, and the while loop test in line 4 fails the ûrst time through. Line 7 executes, incrementing the state number to q C 1, which equals � .T Œ W i �/.  If 0 < � .T Œ W i �/ හ q 0 , then the while loop of lines 435 iterates at least once, checking in decreasing order each value in �  Œq� until it stops at some q 0 < q. Thus, P Œ W q 0 � is the longest preûx of P Œ W q� for which P Œq 0 C 1� D T Œi �, so that when the while loop terminates, q 0 C 1 D � .P Œ W q�T Œi �/. Since q D � .T Œ W i  1�/, Lemma 32.3 implies that � .T Œ W i  1�T Œi �/ D � .P Œ W q�T Œi �/. Thus we have 0 C 1 D � .P Œ W q�T Œi �/ D � .T Œ W i  1�T Œi �/ D � .T Œ W i �/ when the while loop terminates. After line 7 increments q, the new state num- ber q equals � .T Œ W i �/. Line 10 is necessary in KMP-MATCHER, because otherwise, line 4 might try to reference P Œm C 1� after ûnding an occurrence of P . (The argument that q D � .T Œ W i  1�/ upon the next execution of line 4 remains valid by the hint given in Exercise 32.4-8: that ı.m; a/ D ı.�Œm�; a/ or, equivalently, � .P a/ D � .P Œ W �Œm��a/ for any a 2 †.) The remaining argument for the correctness of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm follows from the correctness of FINITE- AUTOMATON-MATCHER, since we have shown that KMP-MATCHER simulates the behavior of FINITE-AUTOMATON-MATCHER.

That is, however, all they can do. This section presents a different approach4sufûx arrays4with which you can ûnd all occurrences of a pattern in a text, but also quite a bit more. A sufûx array won’t ûnd all occurrences 986 Chapter 32 String Matching i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 T Œi� r a t a t a t i SAŒi� rankŒi� LCPŒi� sufûx T ŒSAŒi� W � 1 6 4 0 at 2 4 3 2 atat 3 2 7 4 atatat 4 1 2 0 ratatat 5 7 6 0 t 6 5 1 1 tat 7 3 5 3 tatat Figure 32.11 The sufûx array SA, rank array rank, longest common preûx array LCP, and lexi- cographically sorted sufûxes of the text T D ratatat with length n D 7. The value of rankŒi� indicates the position of the sufûx T Œi W � in the lexicographically sorted order: rankŒSAŒi�� D i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. The rank array is used to compute the LCP array. of a pattern as quickly as, say, the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, but its additional üexibility makes it well worth studying. A sufûx array is simply a compact way to represent the lexicographically sorted order of all n sufûxes of a length-n text. Given a text T Œ1 W n�, let T Œi W � denote the sufûx T Œi W n�. The sufﬁx array SAŒ1 W n� of T is deûned such that if SAŒi � D j , then T Œj W � is the i th sufûx of T in lexicographic order. 3 That is, the i th sufûx of T in lexicographic order is T ŒSAŒi � W �. Along with the sufûx array, another useful array is the longest common preﬁx array LCPŒ1 W n�. The entry LCPŒi � gives the length of the longest common preûx between the i th and .i  1/st sufûxes in the sorted order (with LCPŒSAŒ1�� deûned to be 0, since there is no preûx lexicographically smaller than T ŒSAŒ1� W �). Figure 32.11 shows the sufûx array and longest common preûx array for the 7-character text ratatat. Given the sufûx array for a text, you can search for a pattern via binary search on the sufûx array. Each occurrence of a pattern in the text starts some sufûx of the text, and because the sufûx array is in lexicographically sorted order, all occurrences of a pattern will appear at the start of consecutive entries of the sufûx array. For example, in Figure 32.11, the three occurrences of at in ratatat appear in entries 1 through 3 of the sufûx array. If you ûnd the length-m pattern in the length-n sufûx array via binary search (taking O.m lg n/ time because each comparison takes O.m/ time), then you can ûnd all occurrences of the pattern in the text by searching backward and forward from that spot until you ûnd a sufûx that does not start with the pattern (or you go beyond the bounds of the sufûx array). If the pattern occurs k times, then the time to ûnd all k occurrences is O.m lg n C km/. 3 Informally, lexicographic order is <alphabetical order= in the underlying character set. A more precise deûnition of lexicographic order appears in Problem 12-2 on page 327. 32.5 Sufﬁx arrays 987 With the longest common preûx array, you can ûnd a longest repeated substring, that is, the longest substring that occurs more than once in the text. If LCPŒi � contains a maximum value in the LCP array, then a longest repeated substring appears in T ŒSAŒi � W SAŒi � C LCPŒi �  1�. In the example of Figure 32.11, the LCP array has one maximum value: LCPŒ3� D 4. Therefore, since SAŒ3� D 2, the longest repeated substring is T Œ2 W 5� D atat. Exercise 32.5-3 asks you to use the sufûx array and longest common preûx array to ûnd the longest common substrings between two texts. Next, we’ll see how to compute the sufûx array for an n-character text in O.n lg n/ time and, given the sufûx array and the text, how to compute the longest common preûx array in ‚.n/ time. Computing the sufﬁx array There are several algorithms to compute the sufûx array of a length-n text. Some run in linear time, but are rather complicated. One such algorithm is given in Problem 32-2. Here we’ll explore a simpler algorithm that runs in ‚.n lg n/ time. The idea behind the O.n lg n/-time procedure COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY on the following page is to lexicographically sort substrings of the text with increasing lengths. The procedure makes several passes over the text, with the substring length doubling each time. By the dlg neth pass, the procedure is sorting all the sufûxes, thereby gaining the information needed to construct the sufûx array. The key to attaining an O.n lg n/-time algorithm will be to have each pass after the ûrst sort in linear time, which will indeed be possible by using radix sort. Let’s start with a simple observation. Consider any two strings, s 1 and s 2 . De- compose s 1 into s 0 1 and s 00 1 , so that s 1 is s 0 1 concatenated with s 00 1 . Likewise, let s 2 be s 0 2 concatenated with s 00 2 . Now, suppose that s 0 1 is lexicographically smaller than s 0 2 . Then, regardless of s 00 1 and s 00 2 , it must be the case that s 1 is lexicographically smaller than s 2 . For example, let s 1 D aaz and s 2 D aba, and decompose s 1 into s 0 1 D aa and s 00 1 D z and s 2 into s 0 2 D ab and s 00 2 D a. Because s 0 1 is lexicographically smaller than s 0 2 , it follows that s 1 is lexicographically smaller than s 2 , even though s 00 2 is lexicographically smaller than s 00 1 . Instead of comparing substrings directly, COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY represents substrings of the text with integer ranks. Ranks have the simple property that one substring is lexicographically smaller then another if and only if it has a smaller rank. Identical substrings have equal ranks. Where do these ranks come from? Initially, the substrings being considered are just single characters from the text. Assume that, as in many programming lan- guages, there is a function, ord, that maps a character to its underlying encoding, which is a positive integer. The ord function could be the ASCII or Unicode encod- ings or any other function that produces a relative ordering of the characters. For example if all the characters are known to be lowercase letters, then ord.a/ D 1, 988 Chapter 32 String Matching COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY .T; n/ 1 allocate arrays substr-rank Œ1 W n�, rankŒ1 W n�, and SAŒ1 W n� 2 for i D 1 to n 3 substr-rank Œi �: left-rank D ord.T Œi �/ 4 if i < n 5 substr-rank Œi �: right-rank D ord.T Œi C 1�/ 6 else substr-rank Œi �: right-rank D 0 7 substr-rank Œi �: index D i 8 sort the array substr-rank into monotonically increasing order based on the left-rank attributes, using the right-rank attributes to break ties; if still a tie, the order does not matter 9 l D 2 10 while l < n 11 MAKE-RANKS.substr-rank ; rank; n/ 12 for i D 1 to n 13 substr-rank Œi �: left-rank D rankŒi � 14 if i C l හ n 15 substr-rank Œi �: right-rank D rankŒi C l� 16 else substr-rank Œi �: right-rank D 0 17 substr-rank Œi �: index D i 18 sort the array substr-rank into monotonically increasing order based on the left-rank attributes, using the right-rank attributes to break ties; if still a tie, the order does not matter 19 l D 2l 20 for i D 1 to n 21 SAŒi � D substr-rank Œi �: index 22 return SA MAKE-RANKS.substr-rank ; rank; n/ 1 r D 1 2 rankŒsubstr-rank Œ1�: index� D r 3 for i D 2 to n 4 if substr-rank Œi �: left-rank ¤ substr-rank Œi  1�: left-rank or substr-rank Œi �: right-rank ¤ substr-rank Œi  1�: right-rank 5 r D r C 1 6 rankŒsubstr-rank Œi �: index� D r 32.5 Sufﬁx arrays 989 After lines 2–7 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 114 97 1 ra 2 97 116 2 at 3 116 97 3 ta 4 97 116 4 at 5 116 97 5 ta 6 97 116 6 at 7 116 0 7 t After line 8 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 97 116 2 at 2 97 116 4 at 3 97 116 6 at 4 114 97 1 ra 5 116 0 7 t 6 116 97 3 ta 7 116 97 5 ta Figure 32.12 The substr-rank array for indices i D 1; 2; : : : ; 7 after the for loop of lines 237 and after the sorting step in line 8 for input string T D ratatat. ord.b/ D 2, . . . , ord.z/ D 26 would work. Once the substrings being consid- ered contain multiple characters, their ranks will be positive integers less than or equal to n, coming from their relative order after being sorted. An empty substring always has rank 0, since it is lexicographically less than any nonempty substring. The COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY procedure uses objects internally to keep track of the relative ordering of the substrings according to their ranks. When con- sidering substrings of a given length, the procedure creates and sorts an array substr-rank Œ1 W n� of n objects, each with the following attributes:  left-rank contains the rank of the left part of the substring.  right-rank contains the rank of the right part of the substring.  index contains the index into the text T of where the substring starts. Before delving into the details of how the procedure works, let’s look at how it operates on the input text ratatat, with n D 7. Assuming that the ord func- tion returns the ASCII code for a character, Figure 32.12 shows the substr-rank array after the for loop of lines 237 and then after the sorting step in line 8. The left-rank and right-rank values after lines 237 are the ranks of length-1 substrings in positions i and i C 1, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. These initial ranks are the ASCII values of the characters. At this point, the left-rank and right-rank values give the ranks of the left and right part of each substring of length 2. Because the substring starting at index 7 consists of only one character, its right part is empty and so its right-rank is 0. After the sorting step in line 8, the substr-rank array gives the relative lexicographic order of all the substrings of length 2, with starting points of these substrings in the index attribute. For example, the lexicographically small- est length-2 substring is at, which starts at position substr-rank Œ1�: index, which equals 2. This substring also occurs at positions substr-rank Œ2�: index D 4 and substr-rank Œ3�: index D 6. The procedure then enters the while loop of lines 10319. The loop variable l gives an upper bound on the length of substrings that have been sorted thus far. 990 Chapter 32 String Matching After line 11 i rank 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 1 5 4 6 1 7 3 After lines 12–17 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 2 4 1 rata 2 1 1 2 atat 3 4 4 3 tata 4 1 1 4 atat 5 4 3 5 tat 6 1 0 6 at 7 3 0 7 t After line 18 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 1 0 6 at 2 1 1 2 atat 3 1 1 4 atat 4 2 4 1 rata 5 3 0 7 t 6 4 3 5 tat 7 4 4 3 tata Figure 32.13 The rank array after line 11 and the substr-rank array after lines 12317 and after line 18 in the ûrst iteration of the while loop of lines 10319, where l D 2. Entering the while loop, therefore, the substrings of length at most l D 2 are sorted. The call of MAKE-RANKS in line 11 gives each of these substrings its rank in the sorted order, from 1 up to the number of unique length-2 substrings, based on the values it ûnds in the substr-rank array. With l D 2, MAKE-RANKS sets rankŒi � to be the rank of the length-2 substring T Œi W i C 1�. Figure 32.13 shows these new ranks, which are not necessarily unique. For example, since the length-2 substring at occurs at positions 2, 4, and 6, MAKE-RANKS ûnds that substr-rank Œ1�, substr-rank Œ2�, and substr-rank Œ3� have equal values in left-rank and in right-rank. Since substr-rank Œ1�: index D 2, substr-rank Œ2�: index D 4, and substr-rank Œ3�: index D 6, and since at is the smallest substring in lexicographic order, MAKE-RANKS sets rankŒ2� D rankŒ4� D rankŒ6� D 1. This iteration of the while loop will sort the substrings of length at most 4 based on the ranks from sorting the substrings of length at most 2. The for loop of lines 12317 reconstitutes the substr-rank array, with substr-rank Œi �: left-rank based on rankŒi � (the rank of the length-2 substring T Œi W i C1�) and substr-rank Œi �: right-rank based on rankŒi C2� (the rank of the length-2 substring T Œi C2 W i C3�, which is 0 if this substring starts beyond the end of the length-n text). Together, these two ranks give the relative rank of the length-4 substring T Œi W i C 3�. Figure 32.13 shows the effect of lines 12317. The ûgure also shows the result of sorting the substr-rank array in line 18, based on the left-rank attribute, and using the right-rank attribute to break ties. Now substr-rank gives the lexicographically sorted order of all sub- strings with length at most 4. The next iteration of the while loop, with l D 4, sorts the substrings of length at most 8 based on the ranks from sorting the substrings of length at most 4 4. Figure 32.14 shows the ranks of the length-4 substrings and the substr-rank array 4 Why keep saying <length at most=? Because for a given value of l , a substring of length l starting at position i is T Œi W i C l  1�. If i C l  1 > n, then the substring cuts off at the end of the text. 32.5 Sufﬁx arrays 991 After line 11 i rank 1 3 2 2 3 6 4 2 5 5 6 1 7 4 After lines 12–17 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 3 5 1 ratatat 2 2 1 2 atatat 3 6 4 3 tatat 4 2 0 4 atat 5 5 0 5 tat 6 1 0 6 at 7 4 0 7 t After line 18 i left-rank right-rank index substring 1 1 0 6 at 2 2 0 4 atat 3 2 1 2 atatat 4 3 5 1 ratatat 5 4 0 7 t 6 5 0 5 tat 7 6 4 3 tatat Figure 32.14 The rank array after line 11 and the substr-rank array after lines 12317 and after line 18 in the second4and ûnal4iteration of the while loop of lines 10319, where l D 4. before and after sorting. This iteration is the ûnal one, since with the length n of the text equaling 7, the procedure has sorted all substrings. In general, as the loop variable l increases, more and more of the right parts of the substrings are empty. Therefore, more of the right-rank values are 0. Because i is at most n within the loop of lines 12317, the left part of each substring is always nonempty, and so all left-rank values are always positive. This example illuminates why the COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY procedure works. The initial ranks established in lines 237 are simply the ord values of the charac- ters in the text, and so when line 8 sorts the substr-rank array, its ordering cor- responds to the lexicographic ordering of the length-2 substrings. Each iteration of the while loop of lines 10319 takes sorted substrings of length l and produces sorted substrings of length 2l . Once l reaches or exceeds n, all substrings have been sorted. Within an iteration of the while loop, the MAKE-RANKS procedure <re-ranks= the substrings that were sorted, either by line 8 before the ûrst iteration or by line 18 in the previous iteration. MAKE-RANKS takes a substr-rank array, which has been sorted, and ûlls in an array rankŒ1 W n� so that rankŒi � is the rank of the i th substring represented in the substr-rank array. Each rank is a positive integer, starting from 1, and going up to the number of unique substrings of length 2l . Substrings with equal values of left-rank and right-rank receive the same rank. Otherwise, a substring that is lexicographically smaller than another appears earlier in the substr-rank array, and it receives a smaller rank. Once the substrings of length 2l are re-ranked, line 18 sorts them by rank, preparing for the next iteration of the while loop. Once l reaches or exceeds n and all substrings are sorted, the values in the index attributes give the starting positions of the sorted substrings. These indices are precisely the values that constitute the sufûx array. Let’s analyze the running time of COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY. Lines 137 take ‚.n/ time. Line 8 takes O.n lg n/ time, using either merge sort (see Section 2.3.1) or heapsort (see Chapter 6). Because the value of l doubles in each iteration of 992 Chapter 32 String Matching the while loop of lines 10319, this loop makes dlg ne  1 iterations. Within each iteration, the call of MAKE-RANKS takes ‚.n/ time, as does the for loop of lines 12317. Line 18, like line 8, takes O.n lg n/ time, using either merge sort or heap- sort. Finally, the for loop of lines 20321 takes ‚.n/ time. The total time works out to O.n lg 2 n/. A simple observation allows us to reduce the running time to ‚.n lg n/. The values of left-rank and right-rank being sorted in line 18 are always integers in the range 0 to n. Therefore, radix sort can sort the substr-rank array in ‚.n/ time by ûrst running counting sort (see Chapter 8) based on right-rank and then running counting sort based on left-rank. Now each iteration of the while loop of lines 10319 takes only ‚.n/ time, giving a total time of ‚.n lg n/. Exercise 32.5-2 asks you to make a simple modiûcation to C OMPUTE-SUFFIX- ARRAY that allows the while loop of lines 10319 to iterate fewer than dlg ne  1 times for certain inputs. Computing the LCP array Recall that LCPŒi � is deûned as the length of the longest common preûx of the .i  1/st and i th lexicographically smallest sufûxes T ŒSAŒi  1� W � and T ŒSAŒi � W �. Because T ŒSAŒ1� W � is the lexicographically smallest sufûx, we deûne LCPŒ1� to be 0. In order to compute the LCP array, we need an array rank that is the inverse of the SA array, just like the ûnal rank array in COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY: if SAŒi � D j , then rankŒj � D i . That is, we have rankŒSAŒi �� D i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. For a sufûx T Œi W �, the value of rankŒi � gives the position of this sufûx in the lexi- cographically sorted order. Figure 32.11 includes the rank array for the ratatat example. For example, the sufûx tat is T Œ5 W �. To ûnd this sufûx’s position in the sorted order, look up rankŒ5� D 6. To compute the LCP array, we will need to determine where in the lexicograph- ically sorted order a sufûx appears, but with its ûrst character removed. The rank array helps. Consider the i th smallest sufûx, which is T ŒSAŒi � W �. Dropping its ûrst character gives the sufûx T ŒSAŒi � C 1 W �, that is, the sufûx starting at posi- tion SAŒi � C 1 in the text. The location of this sufûx in the sorted order is given by rankŒSAŒi � C 1�. For example, for the sufûx atat, let’s see where to ûnd tat (atat with its ûrst character removed) in the lexicographically sorted order. The sufûx atat appears in position 2 of the sufûx array, and SAŒ2� D 4. Thus, rankŒSAŒ2� C 1� D rankŒ5� D 6, and sure enough the sufûx tat appears in loca- tion 6 in the sorted order. The procedure COMPUTE-LC P on the next page produces the LCP array. The following lemma helps show that the procedure is correct. 32.5 Sufﬁx arrays 993 COMPUTE-LCP .T; SA; n/ 1 allocate arrays rankŒ1 W n� and LCPŒ1 W n� 2 for i D 1 to n 3 rankŒSAŒi �� D i // by deûnition 4 LCPŒ1� D 0 // also by deûnition 5 l D 0 // initialize length of LCP 6 for i D 1 to n 7 if rankŒi � > 1 8 j D SAŒrankŒi �  1� // T Œj W � precedes T Œi W � lexicographically 9 m D max fi; j g 10 while m C l හ n and T Œi C l� == T Œj C l� 11 l D l C 1 // next character is in common preûx 12 LCPŒrankŒi �� D l // length of LCP of T Œj W � and T Œi W � 13 if l > 0 14 l D l  1 // peel off ûrst character of common preûx 15 return LCP Lemma 32.8 Consider sufûxes T Œi  1 W � and T Œi W �, which appear at positions rankŒi  1� and rankŒi �, respectively, in the lexicographically sorted order of sufûxes. If LCPŒrankŒi  1�� D l > 1, then the sufûx T Œi W �, which is T Œi  1 W � with its ûrst character removed, has LCPŒrankŒi ��  l  1. Proof The sufûx T Œi  1 W � appears at position rankŒi  1� in the lexicographically sorted order. The sufûx immediately preceding it in the sorted order appears at position rankŒi  1�  1 and is T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� W �. By assumption and the deûnition of the LCP array, these two sufûxes, T ŒSAŒrankŒi 1�1� W � and T Œi 1 W �, have a longest common preûx of length l > 1. Removing the ûrst character from each of these sufûxes gives the sufûxes T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1 W � and T Œi W �, respectively. These sufûxes have a longest common preûx of length l  1. If T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1 W � immediately precedes T Œi W � in the lexicographically sorted order (that is, if rankŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1� D rankŒi �  1), then the lemma is proven. So now assume that T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1 W � does not immediately precede T Œi W � in the sorted order. Since T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� W � immediately precedes T Œi  1 W � and they have the same ûrst l > 1 characters, T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1 W � must appear in the sorted order somewhere before T Œi W �, with one or more other sufûxes intervening. Each of these sufûxes must start with the same l 1 characters as T ŒSAŒrankŒi 1� 1� C1 W � and T Œi W �, for otherwise it would appear either before 994 Chapter 32 String Matching T ŒSAŒrankŒi  1�  1� C 1 W � or after T Œi W �. Therefore, whichever sufûx appears in position rankŒi �  1, immediately before T Œi W �, has at least its ûrst l  1 characters in common with T Œi W �. Thus, LCPŒrankŒi ��  l  1. The COMPUTE-LC P procedure works as follows. After allocating the rank and LCP arrays in line 1, lines 233 ûll in the rank array and line 4 pegs LCPŒ1� to 0, per the deûnition of the LCP array. The for loop of lines 6314 ûlls in the rest of the LCP array going by decreasing- length sufûxes. That is, it ûlls the position of the LCP array in the order rankŒ1�; rankŒ2�; rankŒ3�; : : : ; rankŒn�, with the assignment occurring in line 12. Upon con- sidering a sufûx T Œi W �, line 8 determines the sufûx T Œj W � that immediately pre- cedes T Œi W � in the lexicographically sorted order. At this point, the longest com- mon preûx of T Œj W � and T Œi W � has length at least l . This property certainly holds upon the ûrst iteration of the for loop, when l D 0. Assuming that line 12 sets LCPŒrankŒi �� correctly, line 14 (which decrements l if it is positive) and Lemma 32.8 maintain this property for the next iteration. The longest common preûx of T Œj W � and T Œi W � might be even longer than the value of l at the start of the iteration, however. Lines 9311 increment l for each additional character the preûxes have in common so that it achieves the length of the longest common pre- ûx. The index m is set in line 9 and used in the test in line 10 to make sure that the test T Œi C l� == T Œj C l� for extending the longest common preûx does not run off the end of the text T . When the while loop of lines 10311 terminates, l is the length of the longest common preûx of T Œj W � and T Œi W �. As a simple aggregate analysis shows, the COMPUTE-LC P procedure runs in ‚.n/ time. Each of the two for loops iterates n times, and so it remains only to bound the total number of iterations by the while loop of lines 10311. Each iteration increases l by 1, and the test m C l හ n ensures that l is always less than n. Because l has an initial value of 0 and decreases at most n  1 times in line 14, line 11 increments l fewer than 2n times. Thus, COMPUTE-LC P takes ‚.n/ time. Exercises 32.5-1 Show the substr-rank and rank arrays before each iteration of the while loop of lines 10319 and after the last iteration of the while loop, the sufûx array SA re- turned, and the sorted sufûxes when COMPUTE-SUFFIX-ARRAY is run on the text hippityhoppity.

Describe an input that allows the procedure to make O.1/ iterations. Describe an input that forces the procedure to make the maximum number of iterations. 32.5-3 Given two texts, T 1 of length n 1 and T 2 of length n 2 , show how to use the sufûx ar- ray and longest common preûx array to ûnd all of the longest common substrings, that is, the longest substrings that appear in both T 1 and T 2 . Your algorithm should run in O.n lg n C kl/ time, where n D n 1 C n 2 and there are k such longest substrings, each with length l . 32.5-4 Professor Markram proposes the following method to ûnd the longest palindromes in a string T Œ1 W n� by using its sufûx array and LCP array. (Recall from Prob- lem 14-2 that a palindrome is a nonempty string that reads the same forward and backward.) Let @ be a character that does not appear in T . Construct the text T 0 as the concatenation of T , @, and the reverse of T . Denote the length of T 0 by n 0 D 2n C 1. Create the sufûx array SA and LCP array LCP for T 0 . Since the indices for a palindrome and its reverse appear in consecutive positions in the sufûx array, ûnd the entries with the maximum LCP value LCPŒi � such that SAŒi  1� D n 0  SAŒi �  LCPŒi � C 2. (This constraint prevents a substring4and its reverse4from being construed as a palindrome unless it really is one.) For each such index i , one of the longest palindromes is T 0 ŒSAŒi � W SAŒi � C LCPŒi �  1�. For example, if the text T is unreferenced, with n D 12, then the text T 0 is unreferenced@decnerefernu, with n 0 D 25 and the following sufûx array and LCP array: i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 T 0 Œi� u n r e f e r e n c e d @ d e c n e r e f e r n u SAŒi� 13 10 16 12 14 15 11 4 20 8 18 6 22 5 21 9 17 2 24 3 19 7 23 25 1 LCPŒi� 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 4 1 1 3 2 0 3 0 1 1 1 0 5 2 1 0 1 The maximum LCP value is achieved at LCPŒ21� D 5, and SAŒ20� D 3 D n 0  SAŒ21�  LCPŒ21� C 2. The sufûxes of T 0 starting at indices SAŒ20� and SAŒ21� are referenced@decnerefernu and refernu, both of which start with the length-5 palindrome refer. 996 Chapter 32 String Matching Alas, this method is not foolproof. Give an input string T that causes this method to give results that are shorter than the longest palindrome contained within T , and explain why your input causes the method to fail. Problems 32-1 String matching based on repetition factors Let y i denote the concatenation of string y with itself i times. For example, .ab/ 3 D ababab. We say that a string x 2 †  has repetition factor r if x D y r for some string y 2 †  and some r > 0. Let �.x/ denote the largest r such that x has repetition factor r . a.

As in Section 32.5, assume that each character in the text is represented by an underlying encoding, which is a positive integer. The idea behind the linear-time algorithm is to compute the sufûx array for the sufûxes starting at 2=3 of the positions in the text, recursing as needed, use the resulting information to sort the sufûxes starting at the remaining 1=3 of the posi- tions, and then merge the sorted information in linear time to produce the full sufûx array. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, if i mod 3 equals 1 or 2, then i is a sample position, and the sufûxes starting at such positions are sample sufﬁxes. Positions 3; 6; 9; : : : are non- sample positions, and the sufûxes starting at nonsample positions are nonsample sufﬁxes. The algorithm sorts the sample sufûxes, sorts the nonsample sufûxes (aided by the result of sorting the sample sufûxes), and merges the sorted sample and non- sample sufûxes. Using the example text T D bippityboppityboo , here is the algorithm in detail, listing substeps of each of the above steps: 1. The sample sufûxes comprise about 2=3 of the sufûxes. Sort them by the fol- lowing substeps, which work with a heavily modiûed version of T and may require recursion. In part (a) of this problem on page 999, you will show that the orders of the sufûxes of T and the sufûxes of the modiûed version of T are the same. A. Construct two texts P 1 and P 2 made up of <metacharacters= that are actually substrings of three consecutive characters from T . We delimit each such metacharacter with parentheses. Construct 1 D .T Œ1 W 3�/ .T Œ4 W 6�/ .T Œ7 W 9�/    .T Œn 0 W n 0 C 2�/ ; where n 0 is the largest integer congruent to 1, modulo 3, that is less than or equal to n and T is extended beyond position n with the special character ¿, with encoding 0. With the example text T D bippityboppityboo , we get that 1 D .bip/ .pit/ .ybo/ .ppi/ .tyb/ .oo¿/ : Similarly, construct 2 D .T Œ2 W 4�/ .T Œ5 W 7�/ .T Œ8 W 10�/    .T Œn 00 W n 00 C 2�/ ; where n 00 is the largest integer congruent to 2, modulo 3, that is less than or equal to n. For our example, we have P 2 D .ipp/ .ity/ .bop/ .pit/ .ybo/ .o¿¿/ : 998 Chapter 32 String Matching position in T 1 4 7 10 13 16 2 5 8 11 14 17 metacharacter in P .bip/ .pit/ .ybo/ .ppi/ .tyb/ .oo¿/ .ipp/ .ity/ .bop/ .pit/ .ybo/ .o¿¿/ character in P 0 1 7 10 8 9 6 3 4 2 7 10 5 position in P 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 SA P 0 1 9 7 8 12 6 10 2 4 5 11 3 positions in T 1 8 2 5 17 16 11 4 10 13 14 7 of sorted sample sufûxes of T Figure 32.15 Computed values when sorting the sample sufûxes of the linear-time sufûx-array algorithm for the text T D bippityboppityboo. If n is a multiple of 3, append the metacharacter .¿¿¿/ to the end of P 1 . In this way, P 1 is guaranteed to end with a metacharacter containing ¿. (This property helps in part (a) of this problem.) The text P 2 may or may not end with a metacharacter containing ¿. B. Concatenate P 1 and P 2 to form a new text P . Figure 32.15 shows P for our example, along with the corresponding positions of T . C. Sort and rank the unique metacharacters of P , with ranks starting from 1. In the example, P has 10 unique metacharacters: in sorted order, they are .bip/, .bop/, .ipp/, .ity/, .o¿¿/, .oo¿/, .pit/, .ppi/, .tyb/, .ybo/. The metacharacters .pit/ and .ybo/ each appear twice. D. As Figure 32.15 shows, construct a new <text= P 0 by renaming each metacharacter in P by its rank. If P contains k unique metacharacters, then each <character= in P 0 is an integer from 1 to k. The sufûx arrays for P and P 0 are identical. E. Compute the sufûx array SA P 0 of P 0 . If the characters of P 0 (i.e., the ranks of metacharacters in P ) are unique, then you can compute its sufûx array directly, since the ordering of the individual characters gives the sufûx array. Otherwise, recurse to compute the sufûx array of P 0 , treating the ranks in P 0 as the input characters in the recursive call. Figure 32.15 shows the sufûx array SA P 0 for our example. Since the number of metacharacters in P , and hence the length of P 0 , is approximately 2n=3, this recursive subproblem is smaller than the current problem. F. From SA P 0 and the positions in T corresponding to the sample positions, compute the list of positions of the sorted sample sufûxes of the original text T . Figure 32.15 shows the list of positions in T of the sorted sample sufûxes in our example. 2. The nonsample sufûxes comprise about 1=3 of the sufûxes. Using the sorted sample sufûxes, sort the nonsample sufûxes by the following substeps.

G. Extending the text T by the two special characters ¿¿, so that T now has n C 2 characters, consider each sufûx T Œi W � for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n C 2. Assign a rank r i to each sufûx T Œi W �. For the two special characters ¿¿, set r nC1 D r nC2 D 0. For the sample positions of T , base the rank on the list of sorted sample positions of T . The rank is currently undeûned for the nonsample positions of T . For these positions, set r i D �. Figure 32.16 shows the ranks for T D bippityboppityboo with n D 17. H. Sort the nonsample sufûxes by comparing tuples .T Œi �; r i C1 /. In our ex- ample, we get T Œ15 W � < T Œ12 W � < T Œ9 W � < T Œ3 W � < T Œ6 W � because .b; 6/ < .i; 10/ < .o; 9/ < .p; 8/ < .t; 12/. 3. Merge the sorted sets of sufûxes. From the sorted set of sufûxes, determine the sufûx array of T . This completes the description of a linear-time algorithm for computing sufûx ar- rays. The following parts of this problem ask you to show that certain steps of this algorithm are correct and to analyze the algorithm’s running time. a. Deûne a nonempty sufﬁx at position i of the text P created in substep B as all metacharacters from position i of P up to and including the ûrst metachar- acter of P in which ¿ appears or the end of P . In the example shown in Figure 32.15, the nonempty sufûxes of P starting at positions 1, 4, and 11 of P are .bip/ .pit/ .ybo/ .ppi/ .tyb/ .oo¿/, .ppi/ .tyb/ .oo¿/, and .ybo/ .o¿¿/, respectively. Prove that the order of sufûxes of P is the same as the order of its nonempty sufûxes. Conclude that the order of sufûxes of P gives the order of the sample sufûxes of T . (Hint: If P contains duplicate metacharacters, consider separately the cases in which two sufûxes both start in P 1 , both start in P 2 , and one starts in P 1 and the other starts in P 2 . Use the property that ¿ appears in the last metacharacter of P 1 .) b. Show how to perform substep C in ‚.n/ time, bearing in mind that in a recur- sive call, the characters in T are actually ranks in P 0 in the caller. c. Argue that the tuples in substep H are unique. Then show how to perform this substep in ‚.n/ time. 1000 Chapter 32 String Matching d. Consider two sufûxes T Œi W � and T Œj W �, where T Œi W � is a sample sufûx and T Œj W � is a nonsample sufûx. Show how to determine in ‚.1/ time whether T Œi W � is lexicographically smaller than T Œj W �. (Hint: Consider separately the cases in which i mod 3 D 1 and i mod 3 D 2. Compare tuples whose elements are characters in T and ranks as shown in Figure 32.16. The number of elements per tuple may depend on whether i mod 3 equals 1 or 2.) Conclude that step 3 can be performed in ‚.n/ time. e. Justify the recurrence T .n/ හ T .2n=3 C 2/ C ‚.n/ for the running time of the full algorithm, and show that its solution is O.n/. Conclude that the algorithm runs in ‚.n/ time. 32-3 Burrows-Wheeler transform The Burrows-Wheeler transform, or BWT, for a text T is deûned as follows. First, append a new character that compares as lexicographically less than every charac- ter of T , and denote this character by $ and the resulting string by T 0 . Letting n be the length of T 0 , create n rows of characters, where each row is one of the n cyclic rotations of T 0 . Next, sort the rows lexicographically. The BWT is then the string of n characters in the rightmost column, read top to bottom. For example, let T D rutabaga, so that T 0 D rutabaga$. The cyclic rotations are rutabaga$ utabaga$r tabaga$ru abaga$rut baga$ruta aga$rutab ga$rutaba a$rutabag $rutabaga Sorting the rows and numbering the sorted rows gives 1 $rutabaga 2 a$rutabag 3 abaga$rut 4 aga$rutab 5 baga$ruta 6 ga$rutaba 7 rutabaga$ 8 tabaga$ru 9 utabaga$r Problems for Chapter 32 1001 The BWT is the rightmost column, agtbaa$ur. (The row numbering will be helpful in understanding how to compute the inverse BWT.) The BWT has applications in bioinformatics, and it can also be a step in text compression. That is because it tends to place identical characters together, as in the BWT of rutabaga, which places two of the instances of a together. When identical characters are placed together, or even nearby, additional means of com- pressing become available. Following the BWT, combinations of move-to-front encoding, run-length encoding, and Huffman coding (see Section 15.3) can pro- vide signiûcant text compression. Compression ratios with the BWT tend improve as the text length increases. a. Given the sufûx array for T 0 , show how to compute the BWT in ‚.n/ time. In order to decompress, the BWT must be invertible. Assuming that the alphabet size is constant, the inverse BWT can be computed in ‚.n/ time from the BWT. Let’s look at the BWT of rutabaga, denoting it by BWT Œ1 W n�. Each character in the BWT has a unique lexicographic rank from 1 to n. Denote the rank of BWT Œi � by rankŒi �. If a character appears multiple times in the BWT, each instance of the character has a rank 1 greater than the previous instance of the character. Here are BWT and rank for rutabaga: i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 BWT Œi � a g t b a a $ u r rankŒi � 2 6 8 5 3 4 1 9 7 For example, rankŒ1� D 2 because BWT Œ1� D a and the only character that pre- cedes the ûrst a lexicographically is $ (which we deûned to precede all other char- acters, so that $ has rank 1). Next, we have rankŒ2� D 6 because BWT Œ2� D g and ûve characters in the BWT precede g lexicographically: $, the three instances of a, and b. Jumping ahead to rankŒ5� D 3, that is because BWT Œ5� D a, and because this a is the second instance of a in the BWT, its rank value is 1 greater than the rank value for the previous instance of a, in position 1. There is enough information in BWT and rank to reconstruct T 0 from back to front. Suppose that you know the rank r of a character c in T 0 . Then c is the ûrst character in row r of the sorted cyclic rotations. The last character in row r must be the character that precedes c in T 0 . But you know which character is the last character in row r , because it is BWT Œr�. To reconstruct T 0 from back to front, start with $, which you can ûnd in BWT . Then work backward using BWT and rank to reconstruct T 0 . Let’s see how this strategy works for rutabaga. The last character of T 0 , $, appears in position 7 of BWT . Since rankŒ7� D 1, row 1 of the sorted cyclic rota- tions of T 0 begins with $. The character that precedes $ in T 0 is the last character in row 1, which is BWT Œ1�: a. Now we know that the last two characters of T 0 1002 Chapter 32 String Matching are a$. Looking up rankŒ1�, it equals 2, so that row 2 of the sorted cyclic rotations of T 0 begins with a. The last character in row 2 precedes a in T 0 , and that char- acter is BWT Œ2� D g. Now we know that the last three characters of T 0 are ga$. Continuing on, we have rankŒ2� D 6, so that row 6 of the sorted cyclic rotations begins with g. The character preceding g in T 0 is BWT Œ6� D a, and so the last four characters of T 0 are aga$. Because rankŒ6� D 4, a begins row 4 of the sorted cyclic rotations of T 0 . The character preceding a in T 0 is the last character in row 4, BWT Œ4� D b, and the last ûve characters of T 0 are baga$. And so on, until all n characters of T 0 have been identiûed, from back to front. b. Given the array BWT Œ1 W n�, write pseudcode to compute the array rankŒ1 W n� in ‚.n/ time, assuming that the alphabet size is constant. c. Given the arrays BWT Œ1 W n� and rankŒ1 W n�, write pseudocode to compute T 0 in ‚.n/ time. Chapter notes The relation of string matching to the theory of ûnite automata is discussed by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5]. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm [267] was invented independently by Knuth and Pratt and by Morris, but they published their work jointly. Matiyasevich [317] earlier discovered a similar algorithm, which applied only to an alphabet with two characters and was speciûed for a Turing machine with a two-dimensional tape. Reingold, Urban, and Gries [377] give an alterna- tive treatment of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. The Rabin-Karp algorithm was proposed by Karp and Rabin [250]. Galil and Seiferas [173] give an interest- ing deterministic linear-time string-matching algorithm that uses only O.1/ space beyond that required to store the pattern and text. The sufûx-array algorithm in Section 32.5 is by Manber and Myers [312], who ûrst proposed the notion of sufûx arrays. The linear-time algorithm to compute the longest common preûx array presented here is by Kasai et al. [252]. Problem 32-2 is based on the DC3 algorithm by K¨ arkk¨ ainen, Sanders, and Burkhardt [245]. For a survey of sufûx-array algorithms, see the article by Puglisi, Smyth, and Turpin [370]. To learn more about the Burrows-Wheeler transform from Problem 32-3, see the articles by Burrows and Wheeler [78] and Manzini [314]. 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms Machine learning may be viewed as a subûeld of artiûcial intelligence. Broadly speaking, artiûcial intelligence aims to enable computers to carry out complex per- ception and information-processing tasks with human-like performance. The ûeld of AI is vast and uses many different algorithmic methods. Machine learning is rich and fascinating, with strong ties to statistics and opti- mization. Technology today produces enormous amounts of data, providing myr- iad opportunities for machine-learning algorithms to formulate and test hypotheses about patterns within the data. These hypotheses can then be used to make pre- dictions about the characteristics or classiûcations in new data. Because machine learning is particularly good with challenging tasks involving uncertainty, where observed data follows unknown rules, it has markedly transformed ûelds such as medicine, advertising, and speech recognition. This chapter presents three important machine-learning algorithms: k-means clustering, multiplicative weights, and gradient descent. You can view each of these tasks as a learning problem, whereby an algorithm uses the data collected so far to produce a hypothesis that describes the regularities learned and/or makes predictions about new data. The boundaries of machine learning are imprecise and evolving4some might say that the k-means clustering algorithm should be called <data science= and not <machine learning,= and gradient descent, though an immensely important algorithm for machine learning, also has a multitude of applications outside of machine learning (most notably for optimization problems). Machine learning typically starts with a training phase followed by a prediction phase in which predictions are made about new data. For online learning, the training and prediction phases are intermingled. The training phase takes as input training data, where each input data point has an associated output or label; the label might be a category name or some real-valued attribute. It then produces as an output one or more hypotheses about how the labels depend on the attributes of the input data points. Hypotheses can take many forms, typically some type of formula or algorithm. The learning algorithm used is often a form of gradient 1004 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms descent. The prediction phase then uses the hypothesis on new data in order to make predictions regarding the labels of new data points. The type of learning just described is known as supervised learning, since it starts with a set of inputs that are each labeled. As an example, consider a machine- learning algorithm to recognize spam emails. The training data comprises a collec- tion of emails, each of which is labeled either <spam= or <not spam.= The machine- learning algorithm frames a hypothesis, possibly a rule of the form <if an email has one of a set of words, then it is likely to be spam.= Or it might learn rules that assign a spam score to each word and then evaluates a document by the sum of the spam scores of its constituent words, so that a document with a total score above a certain threshold value is classiûed as spam. The machine-learning algorithm can then predict whether a new email is spam or not. A second form of machine learning is unsupervised learning, where the training data is unlabeled, as in the clustering problem of Section 33.1. Here the machine- learning algorithm produces hypotheses regarding the centers of groups of input data points. A third form of machine learning (not covered further here) is reinforcement learning, where the machine-learning algorithm takes actions in an environment, receives feedback for those actions from the environment, and then updates its model of the environment based on the feedback. The learner is in an environment that has some state, and the actions of the learner have an effect on that state. Reinforcement learning is a natural choice for situations such as game playing or operating a self-driving car. Sometimes the goal in a supervised machine-learning application is not making accurate predictions of labels for new examples, but rather performing causal in- ference: ûnding an explanatory model that describes how the various features of an input data point affect its associated label. Finding a model that ûts a given set of training data well can be tricky. It may involve sophisticated optimization meth- ods that need to balance between producing a hypothesis that ûts the data well and producing a hypothesis that is simple. This chapter focuses on three problem domains: ûnding hypotheses that group the input data points well (using a clustering algorithm), learning which predictors (experts) to rely upon for making predictions in an online learning problem (using the multiplicative-weights algorithm), and ûtting a model to data (using gradient descent). Section 33.1 considers the clustering problem: how to divide a given set of n training data points into a given number k of groups, or <clusters,= based on a mea- sure of how similar (or more accurately, how dissimilar) points are to each other. The approach is iterative, beginning with an arbitrary initial clustering and incor- porating successive improvements until no further improvements occur. Clustering 33.1 Clustering 1005 is often used as an initial step when working on a machine-learning problem to discover what structure exists in the data. Section 33.2 shows how to make online predictions quite accurately when you have a set of predictors, often called <experts,= to rely on, many of which might be poor predictors, but some of which are good predictors. At ûrst, you do not know which predictors are poor and which are good. The goal is to make predictions on new examples that are nearly as good as the predictions made by the best predictor. We study an effective multiplicative-weights prediction method that associates a positive real weight with each predictor and multiplicatively decreases the weights associated with predictors when they make poor predictions. The model in this section is online (see Chapter 27): at each step, we do not know anything about the future examples. In addition, we are able to make predictions even in the presence of adversarial experts, who are collaborating against us, a situation that actually happens in game-playing settings. Finally, Section 33.3 introduces gradient descent, a powerful optimization tech- nique used to ûnd parameter settings in machine-learning models. Gradient descent also has many applications outside of machine learning. Intuitively, gradient de- scent ûnds the value that produces a local minimum for a function by <walking downhill.= In a learning application, a <downhill step= is a step that adjusts hy- pothesis parameters so that the hypothesis does better on the given set of labeled examples. This chapter makes extensive use of vectors. In contrast to the rest of the book, vector names in this chapter appear in boldface, such as x, to more clearly delineate which quantities are vectors. Components of vectors do not appear in boldface, so if vector x has d dimensions, we might write x D .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x d /. 33.1 Clustering Suppose that you have a large number of data points (examples), and you wish to group them into classes based on how similar they are to each other. For example, each data point might represent a celestial star, giving its temperature, size, and spectral characteristics. Or, each data point might represent a fragment of recorded speech. Grouping these speech fragments appropriately might reveal the set of accents of the fragments. Once a grouping of the training data points is found, new data can be placed into an appropriate group, facilitating star-type recognition or speech recognition. These situations, along with many others, fall under the umbrella of clustering. The input to a clustering problem is a set of n examples (objects) and an integer k, with the goal of dividing the examples into at most k disjoint clusters such that 1006 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms the examples in each cluster are similar to each other. The clustering problem has several variations. For example, the integer k might not be given, but instead arises out of the clustering procedure. In this section we presume that k is given. Feature vectors and similarity Let’s formally deûne the clustering problem. The input is a set of n examples. Each example has a set of attributes in common with all other examples, though the attribute values may vary among examples. For example, the clustering problem shown in Figure 33.1 clusters n D 49 examples448 state capitals plus the District of Columbia4into k D 4 clusters. Each example has two attributes: the latitude and longitude of the capital. In a given clustering problem, each example has d attributes, with an example x speciûed by a d -dimensional feature vector x D .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x d / : Here, x a for a D 1; 2; : : : ; d is a real number giving the value of attribute a for example x. We call x the point in R d representing the example. For the example in Figure 33.1, each capital x has its latitude in x 1 and its longitude in x 2 . In order to cluster similar points together, we need to deûne similarity. Instead, let’s deûne the opposite: the dissimilarity �.x; y / of points x and y is the squared Euclidean distance between them: �.x; y / D kx  y k 2 D d X aD1 .x a  y a / 2 : (33.1) Of course, for �.x; y / to be well deûned, all attribute values must be present. If any are missing, then you might just ignore that example, or you could ûll in a missing attribute value with the median value for that attribute. The attribute values are often <messy= in other ways, so that some <data clean- ing= is necessary before the clustering algorithm is run. For example, the scale of attribute values can vary widely across attributes. In the example of Figure 33.1, the scales of the two attributes vary by a factor of 2, since latitude ranges from 90 to C90 degrees but longitude ranges from 180 to C180 degrees. You can imag- ine other scenarios where the differences in scales are even greater. If the examples contain information about students, one attribute might be grade-point average but another might be family income. Therefore, the attribute values are usually scaled or normalized, so that no single attribute can dominate the others when computing dissimilarities. One way to do so is by scaling attribute values with a linear trans- form so that the minimum value becomes 0 and the maximum value becomes 1. If the attribute values are binary values, then no scaling may be needed. Another (j) Iteration 9: f D 1406:74. (k) Iteration 10: f D 1395:73. (l) Iteration 11: f D 1395:73.

Sometimes it makes sense to choose the same scaling rule for several related attributes (for example, if they are lengths measured to the same scale). Also, the choice of dissimilarity measure is somewhat arbitrary. The use of the sum of squared differences as in equation (33.1) is not required, but it is a conven- tional choice and mathematically convenient. For the example of Figure 33.1, you might use the actual distance between capitals rather than equation (33.1). Clusterings With the notion of similarity (actually, dissimilarity) deûned, let’s see how to deûne clusters of similar points. Let S denote the given set of n points in R d . In some applications the points are not necessarily distinct, so that S is a multiset rather than a set. Because the goal is to create k clusters, we deûne a k-clustering of S as a decomposition of S into a sequence hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i of k disjoint subsets, or clusters, so that S D S .1/ [ S .2/ [    [ S .k/ : A cluster may be empty, for example if k > 1 but all of the points in S have the same attribute values. There are many ways to deûne a k-clustering of S and many ways to evaluate the quality of a given k-clustering. We consider here only k-clusterings of S that are deûned by a sequence C of k centers C D hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i ; where each center is a point in R d , and the nearest-center rule says that a point x may belong to cluster S .`/ if the center of no other cluster is closer to x than the center c .`/ of S .`/ : x 2 S .`/ only if �.x; c .`/ / D min f�.x; c .j / / W 1 හ j හ kg : A center can be anywhere, and not necessarily a point in S . Ties are possible and must be broken so that each point lies in exactly one cluster. In general, ties may be broken arbitrarily, although we’ll need the property that we never change which cluster a point x is assigned to unless the distance from x to its new cluster center is strictly smaller than the distance from x to its old cluster center. That is, if the current cluster has a center that is one of the closest cluster centers to x, then don’t change which cluster x is assigned to. The k-means problem is then the following: given a set S of n points and a positive integer k, ûnd a sequence C D hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i of k center points 33.1 Clustering 1009 minimizing the sum f .S; C / of the squared distance from each point to its nearest center, where f .S; C / D X x2S min f�.x; c .j / / W 1 හ j හ kg D k X `D1 X x2S .`/ �.x; c .`/ / : (33.2) In the second line, the k-clustering hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i is deûned by the centers C and the nearest-center rule. See Exercise 33.1-1 for an alternative formulation based on pairwise interpoint distances. Is there a polynomial-time algorithm for the k-means problem? Probably not, because it is NP-hard [310]. As we’ll see in Chapter 34, NP-hard problems have no known polynomial-time algorithm, but nobody has ever proven that polynomial- time algorithms for NP-hard problems cannot exist. Although we know of no polynomial-time algorithm that ûnds the global minimum over all clusterings (ac- cording to equation (33.2)), we can ûnd a local minimum. Lloyd [304] proposed a simple procedure that ûnds a sequence C of k centers that yields a local minimum of f .S; C /. A local minimum in the k-means prob- lem satisûes two simple properties: each cluster has an optimal center (deûned below), and each point is assigned to the cluster (or one of the clusters) with the closest center. Lloyd’s procedure ûnds a good clustering4possibly optimal4that satisûes these two properties. These properties are necessary, but not sufûcient, for optimality. Optimal center for a given cluster In an optimal solution to the k-means problem, each center point must be the centroid, or mean, of the points in its cluster. The centroid is a d -dimensional point, where the value in each dimension is the mean of the values of all the points in the cluster in that dimension (that is, the mean of the corresponding attribute val- ues in the cluster). That is, if c .`/ is the centroid for cluster S .`/ , then for attributes a D 1; 2; : : : ; d , we have c .`/ a D 1 jS .`/ j X x2S .`/ x a : Over all attributes, we write c .`/ D 1 jS .`/ j X x2S .`/ x : (33.3) 1010 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms Theorem 33.1 Given a nonempty cluster S .`/ , its centroid (or mean) is the unique choice for the cluster center c .`/ 2 R d that minimizes X x2S .`/ �.x; c .`/ / : Proof We wish to minimize, by choosing c .`/ 2 R d , the sum X x2S .`/ �.x; c .`/ / D X x2S .`/ d X aD1 .x a  c .`/ a / 2 D d X aD1  X x2S .`/ x 2 a  2  X x2S .`/ x a ! c .`/ a C ˇ ˇ S .`/ ˇ ˇ .c .`/ a / 2 ! : For each attribute a, the term summed is a convex quadratic function in c .`/ a . To minimize this function, take its derivative with respect to c .`/ a and set it to 0: 2 X x2S .`/ x a C 2 ˇ ˇ S .`/ ˇ ˇ c .`/ a D 0 or, equivalently, .`/ a D 1 jS .`/ j X x2S .`/ x a : Since the minimum is obtained uniquely when each coordinate of c .`/ a is the average of the corresponding coordinate for x 2 S .`/ , the overall minimum is obtained when c .`/ is the centroid of the points x, as in equation (33.3). Optimal clusters for given centers The following theorem shows that the nearest-center rule4assigning each point x to one of the clusters whose center is nearest to x4yields an optimal solution to the k-means problem. Theorem 33.2 Given a set S of n points and a sequence hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i of k centers, a clustering hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i minimizes k X `D1 X x2S .`/ �.x; c .`/ / (33.4) if and only if it assigns each point x 2 S to a cluster S .`/ that minimizes �.x; c .`/ /. 33.1 Clustering 1011 Proof The proof is straightforward: each point x 2 S contributes exactly once to the sum (33.4), and choosing to put x in a cluster whose center is nearest minimizes the contribution from x. Lloyd’s procedure Lloyd’s procedure just iterates two operations4assigning points to clusters based on the nearest-center rule, followed by recomputing the centers of clusters to be their centroids4until the results converge. Here is Lloyd’ s procedure: Input: A set S of points in R d , and a positive integer k. Output: A k-clustering hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i of S with a sequence of centers hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i. 1. Initialize centers: Generate an initial sequence hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i of k cen- ters by picking k points independently from S at random. (If the points are not necessarily distinct, see Exercise 33.1-3.) Assign all points to cluster S .1/ to begin. 2. Assign points to clusters: Use the nearest-center rule to deûne the clustering hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i. That is, assign each point x 2 S to a cluster S .`/ having a nearest center (breaking ties arbitrarily, but not changing the assignment for a point x unless the new cluster center is strictly closer to x than the old one). 3. Stop if no change: If step 2 did not change the assignments of any points to clusters, then stop and return the clustering hS .1/ ; S .2/ ; : : : ; S .k/ i and the associated centers hc .1/ ; c .2/ ; : : : ; c .k/ i. Otherwise, go to step 4. 4. Recompute centers as centroids: For ` D 1; 2; : : : ; k, compute the center c .`/ of cluster S .`/ as the centroid of the points in S .`/ . (If S .`/ is empty, let c .`/ be the zero vector.) Then go to step 2. It is possible for some of the clusters returned to be empty, particularly if many of the input points are identical. Lloyd’s procedure always terminates. By Theorem 33.1, recomputing the cen- ters of each cluster as the cluster centroid cannot increase f .S; C /. Lloyd’s pro- cedure ensures that a point is reassigned to a different cluster only when such an operation strictly decreases f .S; C /. Thus each iteration of Lloyd’s procedure, except the last iteration, must strictly decrease f .S; C /. Since there are only a ûnite number of possible k-clusterings of S (at most k n ), the procedure must ter- minate. Furthermore, once one iteration of Lloyd’s procedure yields no decrease in f , further iterations would not change anything, and the procedure can stop at this locally optimum assignment of points to clusters. 1012 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms If Lloyd’s procedure really required k n iterations, it would be impractical. In practice, it sometimes sufûces to terminate the procedure when the percentage de- crease in f .S; C / in the latest iteration falls below a predetermined threshold. Be- cause Lloyd’s procedure is guaranteed to ûnd only a locally optimal clustering, one approach to ûnding a good clustering is to run Lloyd’s procedure many times with different randomly chosen initial centers, taking the best result. The running time of Lloyd’s procedure is proportional to the number T of it- erations. In one iteration, assigning points to clusters based on the nearest-center rule requires O.d k n/ time, and recomputing new centers for each cluster requires O.d n/ time (because each point is in one cluster). The overall running time of the k-means procedure is thus O.T d k n/. Lloyd’s algorithm illustrates an approach common to many machine-learning algorithms: First, deûne a hypothesis space in terms an appropriate sequence ෂ of pa- rameters, so that each ෂ is associated with a speciûc hypothesis h ෂ . (For the k-means problem, ෂ is a d k-dimensional vector, equivalent to C , containing the d -dimensional center of each of the k clusters, and h ෂ is the hypothesis that each data point x should be grouped with a cluster having a center closest to x.)  Second, deûne a measure f .E; ෂ / describing how poorly hypothesis h ෂ ûts the given training data E. Smaller values of f .E; ෂ / are better, and a (locally) opti- mal solution (locally) minimizes f .E; ෂ /. (For the k-means problem, f .E; ෂ / is just f .S; C /.)  Third, given a set of training data E, use a suitable optimization procedure to ûnd a value of ෂ  that minimizes f .E; ෂ  /, at least locally. (For the k-means problem, this value of ෂ  is the sequence C of k center points returned by Lloyd’s algorithm.)  Return ෂ  as the answer. In this framework, we see that optimization becomes a powerful tool for machine learning. Using optimization in this way is üexible. For example, regularization terms can be incorporated in the function to be minimized, in order to penalize hypotheses that are <too complicated= and that <overût= the training data. (Regu- larization is a complex topic that isn’t pursued further here.) Examples Figure 33.1 demonstrates Lloyd’s procedure on a set of n D 49 cities: 48 U.S. state capitals and the District of Columbia. Each city has d D 2 dimensions: latitude and longitude. The initial clustering in part (a) of the ûgure has the initial cluster centers arbitrarily chosen as the capitals of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, 33.1 Clustering 1013 and Tennessee. As the procedure iterates, the value of the function f decreases, until the 11th iteration in part (l), where it remains the same as in the 10th iteration in part (k). Lloyd’s procedure then terminates with the clusters shown in part (l). As Figure 33.2 shows, Lloyd’s procedure can also apply to <vector quantization.= Here, the goal is to reduce the number of distinct colors required to represent a photograph, thereby allowing the photograph to be greatly compressed (albeit in a lossy manner). In part (a) of the ûgure, an original photograph 700 pixels wide and 500 pixels high uses 24 bits (three bytes) per pixel to encode a triple of red, green, and blue (RGB) primary color intensities. Parts (b)3(e) of the ûgure show the results of using Lloyd’s procedure to compress the picture from a initial space of 2 24 possible values per pixel to a space of only k D 4, k D 16, k D 64, or k D 256 possible values per pixel; these k values are the cluster centers. The photograph can then be represented with only 2, 4, 6, or 8 bits per pixel, respectively, instead of the 24-bits per pixel needed by the initial photograph. An auxiliary table, the <palette,= accompanies the compressed image; it holds the k 24-bit cluster centers and is used to map each pixel value to its 24-bit cluster center when the photo is decompressed.

Describe a way to pick a number of cen- ters at random that maximizes the number of distinct centers picked.

Af- ter each decision you receive feedback as to whether your decision was correct. We will study a class of algorithms that are called multiplicative-weights algorithms. This class of algorithms has a wide variety of applications, including game playing in economics, approximately solving linear-programming and multicommodity- üow problems, and various applications in online machine learning. We emphasize the online nature of the problem here: you have to make a sequence of decisions, but some of the information needed to make the i th decision appears only after you have already made the .i  1/st decision. In this section, we look at one par- ticular problem, known as <learning from experts,= and develop an example of a multiplicative-weights algorithm, called the weighted-majority algorithm. Suppose that a series of events will occur, and you want to make predictions about these events. For example, over a series of days, you want to predict whether it is going to rain. Or perhaps you want to predict whether the price of a stock will increase or decrease. One way to approach this problem is to assemble a group of <experts= and use their collective wisdom in order to make good predictions. Let’s denote the experts, n of them, by E 1 ; E 2 ; : : : ; E n , and let’s say that T events are going to take place. Each event has an outcome of either 0 or 1, with o .t / denoting the outcome of the t th event. Before event t , each expert E .i / makes a prediction q .t / i 2 f0; 1g. You, as the <learner,= then take the set of n expert predictions for event t and produce a single prediction p .t / 2 f0; 1g of your own. You base your prediction only on the predictions of the experts and anything you have learned about the experts from their previous predictions. You do not use any additional information about the event. Only after making your prediction do you ascertain the outcome o .t / of event t . If your prediction p .t / matches o .t / , then you were correct; otherwise, you made a mistake. The goal is to minimize the total number m of mistakes, where m D P T t D1 ˇ ˇ p .t /  o .t / ˇ ˇ . You can also keep track of the number of mistakes each expert makes: expert E i makes m i mistakes, where m i D P T t D1 ˇ ˇ q .t / i  o .t / ˇ ˇ . For example, suppose that you are following the price of a stock, and each day you decide whether to invest in it for just that day by buying it at the beginning of the day and selling it at the end of the day. If, on some day, you buy the stock and it goes up, then you made the correct decision, but if the stock goes down, then you made a mistake. Similarly, if on some day, you do not buy the stock and it goes down, then you made the correct decision, but if the stock goes up, then you made a mistake. Since you would like to make as few mistakes as possible, you use the advice of the experts to make your decisions. 1016 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms We’ll assume nothing about the movement of the stock. We’ll also assume noth- ing about the experts: the experts’ predictions could be correlated, they could be chosen to deceive you, or perhaps some are not really experts after all. What algo- rithm would you use? Before designing an algorithm for this problem, we need to consider what is a fair way to evaluate our algorithm. It is reasonable to expect that our algorithm per- forms better when the expert predictions are better, and that it performs worse when the expert predictions are worse. The goal of the algorithm is to limit the number of mistakes you make to be close to the number of mistakes that the best of the experts makes. At ûrst, this goal might seem impossible, because you do not know until the end which expert is best. We’ll see, however, that by taking the advice provided by all the experts into account, you can achieve this goal. More formally, we use the notion of <regret,= which compares our algorithm to the performance of the best expert (in hindsight) over all. Letting m  D min fm i W 1 හ i හ ng de- note the number of mistakes made by the best expert, the regret is m  m  . The goal is to design an algorithm with low regret. (Regret can be negative, although it typically isn’t, since it is rare that you do better than the best expert.) As a warm-up, let’s consider the case in which one of the experts makes a cor- rect prediction each time. Even without knowing who that expert is, you can still achieve good results. Lemma 33.3 Suppose that out of n experts, there is one who always makes the correct prediction for all T events. Then there is an algorithm that makes at most dlg ne mistakes. Proof The algorithm maintains a set S consisting of experts who have not yet made a mistake. Initially, S contains all n experts. The algorithm’s prediction is always the majority vote of the predictions of the experts remaining in set S . In case of a tie, the algorithm makes any prediction. After each outcome is learned, set S is updated to remove all the experts who made an incorrect prediction about that outcome. We now analyze the algorithm. The expert who always makes the correct pre- diction will always be in set S . Every time the algorithm makes a mistake, at least half of the experts who were still in S also make a mistake, and these experts are removed from S . If S 0 is the set of experts remaining after removing those who made a mistake, we have that jS 0 j හ jS j =2. The size of S can be halved at most dlg ne times until jS j D 1. From this point on, we know that the algorithm never makes a mistake, since the set S consists only of the one expert who never makes a mistake. Therefore, overall the algorithm makes at most dlg ne mistakes. 33.2 Multiplicative-weights algorithms 1017 Exercise 33.2-1 asks you to generalize this result to the case when there is no expert who makes perfect predictions and show that, for any set of experts, there is an algorithm that makes at most m  dlg ne mistakes. The generalized algorithm begins in the same way. The set S might become empty at some point, however. If that ever happens, reset S to contain all the experts and continue the algorithm. You can substantially improve your prediction ability by not just tracking which experts have not made any mistakes, or have not made any mistakes recently, to a more nuanced evaluation of the quality of each expert. The key idea is to use the feedback you receive to update your evaluation of how much trust to put in each expert. As the experts make predictions, you observe whether they were correct and decrease your conûdence in the experts who make more mistakes. In this way, you can learn over time which experts are more reliable and which are less reliable, and weight their predictions accordlingly. The change in weights is accomplished via multiplication, hence the term <multiplicative weights.= The algorithm appears in the procedure WEIGHTED-MAJORITY on the follow- ing page, which takes a set E D fE 1 ; E 2 ; : : : ; E n g of experts, a number T of events, the number n of experts, and a parameter 0 < � හ 1=2 that controls how the weights change. The algorithm maintains weights w .t / i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n and t D 1; 2; : : : ; T , where 0 < w .t / i හ 1. The for loop of lines 132 sets the initial weights w .1/ i to 1, capturing the idea that with no knowledge, you trust each expert equally. Each iteration of the main for loop of lines 3318 does the following for an event t D 1; 2; : : : ; T . Each expert E i makes a prediction for event t in line 4. Lines 538 compute upweight .t / , the sum of the weights of the experts who predict 1 for event t , and downweight .t / , the sum of the weights of the experts who predict 0 for the event. Lines 9311 decide the algorithm’s prediction p .t / for event t based on whichever weighted sum is larger (breaking ties in favor of deciding 1). The outcome of event t is revealed in line 12. Finally, lines 14317 decrease the weights of the experts who made an incorrect prediction for event t by multiplying their weights by 1  � , leaving alone the weights of the experts who correctly predicted the event’s outcome. Thus, the fewer mistakes each expert makes, the higher that expert’s weight. The WEIGHTED-MAJORITY procedure doesn’t do much worse than any expert. In particular, it doesn’t do much worse than the best expert. To quantify this claim, let m .t / be the number of mistakes made by the procedure through event t , and let m .t / i be the number of mistakes made by expert E i through event t . The following theorem is the key. 1018 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms WEIGHTED-MAJORITY .E; T; n; � / 1 for i D 1 to n 2 w .1/ i D 1 // trust each expert equally 3 for t D 1 to T 4 each expert E i 2 E makes a prediction q .t / i 5 U D ˚ E i W q .t / i D 1  // experts who predicted 1 6 upweight .t / D P i WE i 2U w .t / i // sum of weights of who predicted 1 7 D D ˚ E i W q .t / i D 0  // experts who predicted 0 8 downweight .t / D P i WE i 2D w .t / i // sum of weights of who predicted 0 9 if upweight .t /  downweight .t / 10 p .t / D 1 // algorithm predicts 1 11 else p .t / D 0 // algorithm predicts 0 12 outcome o .t / is revealed 13 // If p .t / ¤ o .t / , the algorithm made a mistake. 14 for i D 1 to n 15 if q .t / i ¤ o .t / // if expert E .i / made a mistake . . . 16 w .t C1/ i D .1  � /w .t / i // . . . then decrease that expert’s weight 17 else w .t C1/ i D w .t / i 18 return p .t / Theorem 33.4 When running WEIGHTED-MAJORITY, we have, for every expert E i and every event T 0 හ T , m .T 0 / හ 2.1 C � /m .T 0 / i C 2 ln n � : (33.5) Proof Every time an expert E i makes a mistake, its weight, which is initially 1, is multiplied by 1  � , and so we have w .t / i D .1  � / m .t / i (33.6) for t D 1; 2; : : : ; T . We use a potential function W .t/ D P n i D1 w .t / i , summing the weights for all n experts after iteration t of the for loop of lines 3318. Initially, we have W .0/ D n since all n weights start out with the value 1. Because each expert belongs to either the set U or the set D (deûned in lines 5 and 7 of WEIGHTED-MAJORITY), we always have W .t/ D upweight .t / C downweight .t / after each execution of line 8. Consider an iteration t in which the algorithm makes a mistake in its prediction, which means that either the algorithm predicts 1 and the outcome is 0 or the al- 33.2 Multiplicative-weights algorithms 1019 gorithm predicts 0 and the outcome is 1. Without loss of generality, assume that the algorithm predicts 1 and the outcome is 0. The algorithm predicted 1 because upweight .t /  downweight .t / in line 9, which implies that upweight .t /  W .t/=2 : (33.7) Each expert in U then has its weight multiplied by 1  � , and each expert in D has its weight unchanged.

Substituting x for x , we have that for 0 < x හ 1=2, ln.1  x/ D x  x 2 2  x 3 3  x 4 4     : (33.13) Since each term on the right-hand side is negative, we can drop all terms except the ûrst and obtain an upper bound of ln.1  x/ හ x . Since 0 < � හ 1=2, we have ln.1  �=2/ හ �=2 : (33.14) For the lower bound, Exercise 33.2-2 asks you to show that ln.1  x/  x  x 2 when 0 < x හ 1=2, so that �  � 2 හ ln.1  � / : (33.15) Thus, we have .T 0 / i .�  � 2 / හ m .T 0 / i ln.1  � / (by inequality (33.15)) හ m .T 0 / ln.1  �=2/ C ln n (by inequality (33.12) හ m .T 0 / .�=2/ C ln n (by inequality (33.14)) , so that .T 0 / i .�  � 2 / හ m .T 0 / .�=2/ C ln n : (33.16) Subtracting ln n from both sides of inequality (33.16) and then multiplying both sides by 2=� yields m .T 0 / හ 2.1 C � /m .T 0 / i C .2 ln n/=� , thus proving the theo- rem. Theorem 33.4 applies to any expert and any event T 0 හ T . In particular, we can compare against the best expert after all events have occurred, producing the following corollary. Corollary 33.5 At the end of procedure WEIGHTED-MAJORITY, we have m .T / හ 2.1 C � /m  C 2 ln n � : (33.17) Let’s explore this bound. Assuming that p ln n=m  හ 1=2, we can choose � D p ln n=m  and plug into inequality (33.17) to obtain 33.2 Multiplicative-weights algorithms 1021 m .T / හ 2  1 C r ln n m  ! m  C 2 ln n p ln n=m  D 2m  C 2 p m  ln n C 2 p m  ln n D 2m  C 4 p m  ln n ; and so the number of errors is at most twice the number of errors made by the best expert plus a term that is often slower growing than m  . Exercise 33.2-4 shows that you can decrease the bound on the number of errors by a factor of 2 by using randomization, which leads to much stronger bounds. In particular, the upper bound on regret (m  m  ) is reduced from .1 C 2� /m  C .2 ln n/=� to an expected value of � m  C .ln n/=� , where both � and � are at most 1=2. Numerically, we can see that if � D 1=2, WEIGHTED-MAJORITY makes at most 3 times the number of errors as the best expert, plus 4 ln n errors. As another example, suppose that T D 1000 predictions are being made by n D 20 experts, and the best expert is correct 95% of the time, making 50 errors. Then WEIGHTED-MAJORITY makes at most 100.1C� /C2 ln 20=� errors. By choosing � D 1=4, WEIGHTED-MAJORITY makes at most 149 errors, or a success rate of at least 85%. Multiplicative weights methods typically refer to a broader class of algorithms that includes WEIGHTED-MAJORITY. The outcomes and predictions need not be only 0 or 1, but can be real numbers, and there can be a loss associated with a particular outcome and prediction. The weights can be updated by a multiplicative factor that depends on the loss, and the algorithm can, given a set of weights, treat them as a distribution on experts and use them to choose an expert to follow in each event. Even in these more general settings, bounds similar to Theorem 33.4 hold. Exercises 33.2-1 The proof of Lemma 33.3 assumes that some expert never makes a mistake. It is possible to generalize the algorithm and analysis to remove this assumption. The new algorithm begins in the same way. The set S might become empty at some point, however. If that ever happens, reset S to contain all the experts and continue the algorithm. Show that the number of mistakes that this algorithm makes is at most m  dlg ne. 33.2-2 Show that ln.1  x/  x  x 2 when 0 < x හ 1=2.

At each step, choose an expert E i uniformly at random from the set S and then make the same predication as E i . Show that the expected number of mistakes made by this algorithm is dlg ne. 33.2-4 Consider a randomized version of WEIGHTED-MAJORITY. The algorithm is the same, except for the prediction step, which interprets the weights as a probability distribution over the experts and chooses an expert E i according to that distri- bution. It then chooses its prediction to be the same as the prediction made by expert E i . Show that, for any 0 < � < 1=2, the expected number of mistakes made by this algorithm is at most .1 C �/m  C .ln n/=� . 33.3 Gradient descent Suppose that you have a set fp 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p n g of points and you want to ûnd the line that best ûts these points. For any line `, there is a distance d i between each point p i and the line. You want to ûnd the line that minimizes some function f .d 1 ; : : : ; d n /. There are many possible choices for the deûnition of distance and for the function f . For example, the distance can be the projection distance to the line and the function can be the sum of the squares of the distances. This type of problem is common in data science and machine learning4the line is the hypoth- esis that best describes the data4where the particular deûnition of best is deter- mined by the deûnition of distance and the objective f . If the deûnition of distance and the function f are linear, then we have a linear-programming problem, as dis- cussed in Chapter 29. Although the linear-programming framework captures sev- eral important problems, many other problems, including various machine-learning problems, have objectives and constraints that are not necessarily linear. We need frameworks and algorithms to solve such problems. In this section, we consider the problem of optimizing a continuous function and discuss one of the most popular methods to do so: gradient descent. Gra- dient descent is a general method for ûnding a local minimum of a function f W R n ! R, where informally, a local minimum of a function f is a point x for which f .x/ හ f .x 0 / for all x 0 that are <near= x. When the function is con- vex, it can ûnd a point near the global minimizer of f : an n-vector argument x D .x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n / such that f .x/ is minimum. For the intuitive idea behind gradient descent, imagine being in a landscape of hills and valleys, and wanting to get to a low point as quickly as possible. You survey the terrain and choose to 33.3 Gradient descent 1023 move in the direction that takes you downhill the fastest from your current position. You move in that direction, but only for a short while, because as you proceed, the terrain changes and you might need to choose a different direction. So you stop, reevaluate the possible directions and move another short distance in the steepest downhill direction, which might differ from the direction of your previous move- ment. You continue this process until you reach a point from which all directions lead up. Such a point is a local minimum. In order to make this informal procedure more formal, we need to deûne the gradient of a function, which in the analogy above is a measure of the steepness of the various directions. Given a function f W R n ! R, its gradient r f is a function r f W R n ! R n comprising n partial derivatives: .r f /.x/ D ã @f @x 1 ; @f @x 2 ; : : : ; @f @x n ä . Analogous to the derivative of a function of a single variable, the gradient can be viewed as a direction in which the function value locally increases the fastest, and the rate of that increase. This view is informal; in order to make it formal we would have to deûne what local means and place certain conditions, such as continuity or existence of derivatives, on the function. Nevertheless, this view motivates the key step of gradient descent4move in the direction opposite to the gradient, by a distance inüuenced by the magnitude of the gradient. The general procedure of gradient descent proceeds in steps. You start at some initial point x .0/ , which is an n-vector. At each step t , you compute the value of the gradient of f at point x .t/ , that is, .r f /.x .t/ ), which is also an n-vector. You then move in the direction opposite to the gradient in each dimension at x .t/ to arrive at the next point x .t C1/ , which again is an n-vector. Because you moved in a monotonically decreasing direction in each dimension, you should have that f .x .t C1/ / හ f .x .t/ /. Several details are needed to turn this idea into an actual algorithm. The two main details are that you need an initial point and that you need to decide how far to move in the direction of the negative gradient. You also need to understand when to stop and what you can conclude about the quality of the solution found. We will explore these issues further in this section, for both constrained minimization, where there are additional constraints on the points, and unconstrained minimization, where there are none. Unconstrained gradient descent In order to gain intuition, let’s consider unconstrained gradient descent in just one dimension, that is, when f is a function of a scalar x , so that f W R ! R. In this case, the gradient r f of f is just f 0 .x/, the derivative of f with respect to x . Consider the function f shown in blue in Figure 33.3, with minimizer x  and starting point x .0/ . The gradient (derivative) f 0 .x .0/ /, shown in orange, has a negative slope, so that a small step from x .0/ in the direction of increasing x results in a point x 0 for which f .x 0 / < f .x .0/ /. Too large a step, however, results in a 1024 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms x .0/ x 0 x 00 y x x  Figure 33.3 A function f W R ! R, shown in blue. Its gradient at point x .0/ , in orange, has a negative slope, and so a small increase in x from x .0/ to x 0 results in f .x 0 / < f .x .0/ /. Small increases in x from x .0/ head toward y x, which gives a local minimum. Too large an increase in x can end up at x 00 , where f .x 00 / > f .x .0/ /. Small steps starting from x .0/ and going only in the direction of decreasing values of f cannot end up at the global minimizer x  . point x 00 for which f .x 00 / > f .x .0/ /, so this is a bad idea. Restricting ourselves to small steps, where each one has f .x 0 / < f .x/, eventually results in getting close to point y x, which gives a local minimum. By taking only small downhill steps, however, gradient descent has no chance to get to the global minimizer x  , given the starting point x .0/ . We draw two observations from this simple example. First, gradient descent converges toward a local minimum, and not necessarily a global minimum. Sec- ond, the speed at which it converges and how it behaves are related to properties of the function, to the initial point, and to the step size of the algorithm. The procedure GRADIENT-DESCENT on the facing page takes as input a func- tion f , an initial point x .0/ 2 R n , a ûxed step-size multiplier � > 0, and a num- ber T > 0 of steps to take. Each iteration of the for loop of lines 234 performs a step by computing the n-dimensional gradient at point x .t/ and then moving dis- tance � in the opposite direction in the n-dimensional space. The complexity of computing the gradient depends on the function f and can sometimes be expen- sive. Line 3 sums the points visited. After the loop terminates, line 6 returns x-avg, the average of all the points visited except for the last one, x .T / . It might seem more natural to return x .T / , and in fact, in many circumstances, you might prefer to have the function return x .T / . For the version we will analyze, however, we use x-avg. 33.3 Gradient descent 1025 GRADIENT-DESCENT .f; x .0/ ; �; T / 1 sum D 0 // n-dimensional vector, initially all 0 2 for t D 0 to T  1 3 sum D sum C x .t/ // add each of n dimensions into sum 4 x .t C1/ D x .t/  �  .r f /.x .t/ / // .r f /.x .t/ /, x .t C1/ are n-dimensional 5 x-avg D sum=T // divide each of n dimensions by T 6 return x-avg Figure 33.4 depicts how gradient descent ideally runs on a convex 1-dimensional function. 1 We’ll deûne convexity more formally below, but the ûgure shows that each iteration moves in the direction opposite to the gradient, with the distance moved being proportional to the magnitude of the gradient. As the iterations pro- ceed, the magnitude of the gradient decreases, and thus the distance moved along the horizontal axis decreases. After each iteration, the distance to the optimal point x  decreases. This ideal behavior is not guaranteed to occur in general, but the analysis in the remainder of this section formalizes when this behavior occurs and quantiûes the number of iterations needed. Gradient descent does not always work, however. We have already seen that if the function is not convex, gradient descent can converge to a local, rather than global, minimum. We have also seen that if the step size is too large, GRADIENT-DESCENT can overshoot the minimum and wind up farther away. (It is also possible to overshoot the minimum and wind up closer to the optimum.) Analysis of unconstrained gradient descent for convex functions Our analysis of gradient descent focuses on convex functions. Inequality (C.29) on page 1194 deûnes a convex function of one variable, as shown in Figure 33.5. We can extend that deûnition to a function f W R n ! R and say that f is convex if for all x; y 2 R n and for all 0 හ � හ 1, we have f .�x C .1  �/y / හ �f . x/ C .1  �/f . y / : (33.18) (Inequalities (33.18) and (C.29) are the same, except for the dimensions of x and y .) We also assume that our convex functions are closed 2 and differentiable. 1 Although the curve in Figure 33.4 looks concave, according to the deûnition of convexity that we’ll see below, the function f in the ûgure is convex. 2 A function f W R n ! R is closed if, for each ˛ 2 R, the set fx 2 dom.f / W f .x/ හ ˛g is closed, where dom.f / is the domain of f . 1026 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms x  x .0/ x .1/ x .2/ x .3/ x .4/ �  .r f /.x .0/ / �  .r f /.x .1/ / �  .r f /.x .2/ / �  .r f /.x .3/ / Figure 33.4 An example of running gradient descent on a convex function f W R !

Orange lines represent the negative of the gradient at each point, scaled by the step size � . As the iterations proceed, the magnitude of the gradient decreases, and the distance moved decreases correspondingly. After each iteration, the distance to the optimal point x  decreases. x y x  f .x/ f .y / �x C .1  �/y f .�x C .1  �/y / �f . x/ C .1  �/f . y / Figure 33.5 A convex function f W R !

Here, the orange line segment represents all values �f . x/ C .1  �/f . y / for 0 හ � හ 1, and it is above the blue line. A convex function has the property that any local minimum is also a global minimum. To verify this property, consider inequality (33.18), and suppose for the purpose of contradiction that x is a local minimum but not a global minimum and y ¤ x is a global minimum, so f .y / < f .x/. Then we have f .�x C .1  �/y / හ �f . x/ C .1  �/f . y / (by inequality (33.18)) < �f .x/ C .1  �/f . x/ D f .x/ : 33.3 Gradient descent 1027 Thus, letting � approach 1, we see that there is another point near x, say x 0 , such that f .x 0 / < f .x/, so x is not a local minimum. Convex functions have several useful properties. The ûrst property, whose proof we leave as Exercise 33.3-1, says that a convex function always lies above its tan- gent hyperplane. In the context of gradient descent, angle brackets denote the notation for inner product deûned on page 1219 rather than denoting a sequence. Lemma 33.6 For any convex differentiable function f W R n ! R and for all x; y 2 R n , we have f .x/ හ f .y / C h.r f /.x/; x  y i. The second property, which Exercise 33.3-2 asks you to prove, is a repeated application of the deûnition of convexity in inequality (33.18). Lemma 33.7 For any convex function f W R n ! R, for any integer T  1, and for all x .0/ ; : : : ; x .T 1/ 2 R n , we have f Î x .0/ C    C x .T 1/ T Ï හ f .x .0/ / C    C f .x .T 1/ / T : (33.19) The left-hand side of inequality (33.19) is the value of f at the vector x-avg that GRADIENT-DESCENT returns. We now proceed to analyze GRADIENT-DESCENT. It might not return the exact global minimizer x  . We use an error bound � , and we want to choose T so that f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ � at termination. The value of � depends on the number T of iterations and two additional values. First, since you expect it to be better to start close to the global minimizer, � is a function of R D kx .0/  x  k ; (33.20) the euclidean norm (or distance, deûned on page 1219) of the difference between x .0/ and x  . The error bound � is also a function of a quantity we call L, which is an upper bound on the magnitude k.r f /.x/k of the gradient, so that k.r f /.x/k හ L ; (33.21) where x ranges over all the points x .0/ ; : : : ; x .T 1/ whose gradients are computed by GRADIENT-DESCENT. Of course, we don’t know the values of L and R, but for now let’s assume that we do. We’ll discuss later how to remove these assumptions. The analysis of GRADIENT-DESCENT is summarized in the following theorem. 1028 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms Theorem 33.8 Let x  2 R n be the minimizer of a convex function f , and suppose that an execu- tion of GRADIENT-DESCENT .f; x .0/ ; �; T / returns x-avg, where � D R=.L p T / and R and L are deûned in equations (33.20) and (33.21). Let � D RL= p T . Then we have f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ � . We now prove this theorem. We do not give an absolute bound on how much progress each iteration makes. Instead, we use a potential function, as in Sec- tion 16.3. Here, we deûne a potential ˆ.t/ after computing x .t/ , such that ˆ.t/  0 for t D 0; : : : ; T . We deûne the amortized progress in the iteration that com- putes x .t/ as p.t/ D f .x .t/ /  f .x  / C ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/ : (33.22) Along with including the change in potential (ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/), equation (33.22) also subtracts the minimum value f .x  / because ultimately, you care not about the values f .x .t/ / but about how close they are to f .x  /. Suppose that we can show that p.t/ හ B for some value B and t D 0; : : : ; T  1. Then we can substitute for p.t/ using equation (33.22), giving f .x .t/ /  f .x  / හ B  ˆ.t C 1/ C ˆ.t/ : (33.23) Summing inequality (33.23) over t D 0; : : : ; T  1 yields T 1 X t D0 .f .x .t/ /  f .x  // හ T 1 X t D0 .B  ˆ.t C 1/ C ˆ.t// : Observing that we have a telescoping series on the right and regrouping terms, we have that T 1 X t D0 f .x .t/ / !  T  f .x  / හ TB  ˆ.T / C ˆ.0/ : Dividing by T and dropping the positive term ˆ.T / gives P T 1 t D0 f .x .t/ / T  f .x  / හ B C ˆ.0/ T ; (33.24) and thus we have f .x-avg/  f .x  / D f Î P T 1 t D0 x .t/ T Ï  f .x  / (by the deûnition of x-avg) හ P T 1 t D0 f .x .t/ / T  f .x  / (by Lemma 33.7) හ B C ˆ.0/ T (by inequality (33.24)) . (33.25) 33.3 Gradient descent 1029 In other words, if we can show that p.t/ හ B for some value B and choose a potential function where ˆ.0/ is not too large, then inequality (33.25) tells us how close the function value f .x-avg/ is to the function value f .x  / after T iterations. That is, we can set the error bound � to B C ˆ.0/=T . In order to bound the amortized progress, we need to come up with a concrete potential function. Deûne the potential function ˆ.t/ by ˆ.t/ D   x .t/  x    2 2� ; (33.26) that is, the potential function is proportional to the square of the distance between the current point and the minimizer x  . With this potential function in hand, the next lemma provides a bound on the amortized progress made in any iteration of GRADIENT-DESCENT. Lemma 33.9 Let x  2 R n be the minimizer of a convex function f , and consider an execution of GRADIENT-DESCENT.f; x .0/ ; �; T /. Then for each point x .t/ computed by the procedure, we have that p.t/ D f .x .t/ /  f .x  / C ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/ හ �L 2 2 : Proof We ûrst bound the potential change ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/.

As Exercise 33.3-3 asks you to prove, for any two vectors a; b 2 R n , we have ka C bk 2  kak 2 D 2hb; ai C kbk 2 : (33.29) Letting a D x .t/  x  and b D x .t C1/  x .t/ , we can write the right-hand side of equation (33.27) as 1 2 ã ka C bk 2  kak 2 ä .

By the bound on the potential change from inequality (33.31), and using the deûnition of L (inequality (33.21)), we have p.t/ D f .x .t/ /  f .x  / C ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/ (by equation (33.22)) හ f .x .t/ /  f .x  /  .f .x .t/ /  f .x  // C � 2   .r f /.x .t/ /   2 (by inequality (33.31)) D � 2   .r f /.x .t/ /   2 හ �L 2 2 (by inequality (33.21)) . Having bounded the amortized progress in one step, we now analyze the entire GRADIENT-DESCENT procedure, completing the proof of Theorem 33.8. Proof of Theorem 33.8 Inequality (33.25) tells us that if we have an upper bound of B for p.t/, then we also have the bound f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ B C ˆ.0/=T . By equations (33.20) and (33.26), we have that ˆ.0/ D R 2 =.2� /. Lemma 33.9 gives us the upper bound of B D �L 2 =2, and so we have f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ B C ˆ.0/ T (by inequality (33.25)) D �L 2 2 C R 2 2�T : 33.3 Gradient descent 1031 Our choice of � D R=.L p T / in the statement of Theorem 33.8 balances the two terms, and we obtain �L 2 2 C R 2 2�T D R L p T  L 2 2 C R 2 2T  L p T R D RL 2 p T C RL 2 p T D RL p T : Since we chose � D RL= p T in the theorem statement, the proof is complete. Continuing under the assumption that we know R (from equation (33.20)) and L (from inequality (33.21)), we can think of the analysis in a slightly different way. We can presume that we have a target accuracy � and then compute the num- ber of iterations needed. That is, we can solve � D RL= p T for T , obtaining T D R 2 L 2 =� 2 . The number of iterations thus depends on the square of R and L and, most importantly, on 1=� 2 . (The deûnition of L from inequality (33.21) de- pends on T , but we may know an upper bound on L that doesn’t depend on the particular value of T .) Thus, if you want to halve your error bound, you need to run four times as many iterations. It is quite possible that we don’t really know R and L, since you’d need to know x  in order to know R (since R D kx .0/  x  k), and you might not have an explicit upper bound on the gradient, which would provide L. You can, however, interpret the analysis of gradient descent as a proof that there is some step size for which the procedure makes progress toward the minimum. You can then compute a step size � for which f .x .t/ /  f .x .t C1/ / is large enough. In fact, not having a ûxed step size multiplier can actually help in practice, as you are free to use any step size s that achieves sufûcient decrease in the value of f . You can search for a step size that achieves a large decrease via a binary-search-like routine, which is often called line search. For a given function f and step size s , deûne the func- tion g.x .t/ ; s/ D f .x .t/ /  s.r f /.x .t/ /. Start with a small step size s for which g.x .t/ ; s/ හ f .x .t/ /. Then repeatedly double s until g.x .t/ ; 2s/  g.x .t/ ; s/, and then perform a binary search in the interval Œs; 2s�. This procedure can produce a step size that achieves a signiûcant decrease in the objective function. In other circumstances, however, you may know good upper bounds on R and L, typically from problem-speciûc information, which can sufûce. The dominant computational step in each iteration of the for loop of lines 234 is computing the gradient. The complexity of computing and evaluating a gra- dient varies widely, depending on the application at hand. We’ll discuss several applications later. 1032 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms Constrained gradient descent We can adapt gradient descent for constrained minimization to minimize a closed convex function f .x/, subject to the additional requirement that x 2 K, where K is a closed convex body. A body K ෂ R n is convex if for all x; y 2 K, the convex combination �x C .1  �/y 2 K for all 0 හ � හ 1. A closed convex body contains its limit points. Somewhat surprisingly, restricting to the constrained problem does not signiûcantly increase the number of iterations of gradient descent. The idea is that you run the same algorithm, but in each iteration, check whether the current point x .t/ is still within the convex body K. If it is not, just move to the closest point in K. Moving to the closest point is known as projection. We formally deûne the projection … K .x/ of a point x in n dimensions onto a convex body K as the point y 2 K such that kx  y k D min fkx  zk W ´ 2 Kg. If we have x 2 K, then … K .x/ D x. This one change yields the procedure GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED, in which line 4 of GRADIENT-DESCENT is replaced by two lines. It assumes that x .0/ 2 K. Line 4 of GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED moves in the direction of the negative gradient, and line 5 projects back onto K. The lemma that follows helps to show that when x  2 K, if the projection step in line 5 moves from a point outside of K to a point in K, it cannot be moving away from x  .

Let b D … K .b 0 /. Then kb  ak 2 හ kb 0  ak 2 . Proof If b 0 2 K, then b D b 0 and the claim is true. Otherwise, b 0 ¤ b, and as Figure 33.6 shows, we can extend the line segment between b and b 0 to a line `. Let c be the projection of a onto `. Point c may or may not be in K, and if a is on the boundary of K, then c could coincide with b. If c coincides with b (part (c) of the ûgure), then abb 0 is a right triangle, and so kb  ak 2 හ kb 0  ak 2 . 33.3 Gradient descent 1033 (a) (b) (c) K K K a a a b 0 b 0 b 0 b D … K .b 0 / b D … K .b 0 / c D b D … K .b 0 / ` ` ` c c Figure 33.6 Projecting a point b 0 outside the convex body K to the closest point b D … K .b 0 / in K.

If c does not coincide with b (parts (a) and (b) of the ûgure), then because of convexity, the angle †abb 0 must be obtuse. Because angle †abb 0 is obtuse, b lies between c and b 0 on `. Furthermore, because c is the projection of a onto line `, acb and acb 0 must be right triangles. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have that kb 0  ak 2 D ka  ck 2 Ckc  b 0 k 2 and kb  ak 2 D ka  ck 2 Ckc  bk 2 . Sub- tracting these two equations gives kb 0  ak 2  kb  ak 2 D kc  b 0 k 2  kc  bk 2 . Because b is between c and b 0 , we must have kc  b 0 k 2  kc  bk 2 , and thus kb 0  ak 2  kb  ak 2  0. The lemma follows. We can now repeat the entire proof for the unconstrained case and obtain the same bounds. Lemma 33.10 with a D x  , b D x .t C1/ , and b 0 D x 0 .t C1/ tells us that kx .t C1/ x  k 2 හ kx 0 .t C1/ x  k 2 . We can therefore derive an upper bound that matches inequality (33.31). We continue to deûne ˆ.t/ as in equation (33.26), but noting that x .t C1/ , computed in line 5 of GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED, has a different meaning here from in inequality (33.31): ˆ.t C 1/  ˆ.t/ D 1 2�   x .t C1/  x    2  1 2�   x .t/  x    2 (by equation (33.27)) හ 1 2�   x 0 .t C1/  x    2  1 2�   x .t/  x    2 (by Lemma 33.10) D 1 2�  2hx 0 .t C1/  x .t/ ; x .t/  x  i C   x 0 .t C1/  x    2 Í (by equation (33.29)) D 1 2�  2h�  .r f /.x .t/ /; x .t/  x  i C   �  .r f /.x .t/ /   2 Í (by line 4 of GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED) D h.r f /.x .t/ /; x .t/  x  i C � 2   .r f /.x .t/ /   2 : 1034 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms With the same upper bound on the change in the potential function as in equa- tion (33.30), the entire proof of Lemma 33.9 can proceed as before. We can therefore conclude that the procedure GRADIENT- DESCENT- CONSTRAINED has the same asymptotic complexity as GRADIENT- DESCENT. We summarize this re- sult in the following theorem. Theorem 33.11 Let K ෂ R n be a convex body, x  2 R n be the minimizer of a convex func- tion f over K, and � D R=.L p T /, where R and L are deûned in equations (33.20) and (33.21). Suppose that the vector x-avg is returned by an execution of GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED .f; x .0/ ; �; T; K/. Let � D RL= p T . Then we have f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ � . Applications of gradient descent Gradient descent has many applications to minimizing functions and is widely used in optimization and machine learning. Here we sketch how it can be used to solve linear systems. Then we discuss an application to machine learning: prediction using linear regression. In Chapter 28, we saw how to use Gaussian elimination to solve a system of lin- ear equations Ax D b, thereby computing x D A 1 b. If A is an n  n matrix and b is a length-n vector, then the running time of Gaussian elimination is ‚.n 3 /, which for large matrices might be prohibitively expensive. If an approximate solution is acceptable, however, you can use gradient descent. First, let’s see how to use gradient descent as a roundabout4and admittedly inef- ûcient4way to solve for x in the scalar equation ax D b, where a; x; b 2 R. This equation is equivalent to ax  b D 0. If ax  b is the derivative of a convex func- tion f .x/, then ax  b D 0 for the value of x that minimizes f .x/. Given f .x/, gradient descent can then determine this minimizer. Of course, f .x/ is just the in- tegral of ax  b, that is, f .x/ D 1 2 ax 2  bx , which is convex if a  0. Therefore, one way to solve ax D b for a  0 is to ûnd the minimizer for 1 2 ax 2  bx via gradient descent. We now generalize this idea to higher dimensions, where using gradient descent may actually lead to a faster algorithm. One n-dimensional analog is the function f .x/ D 1 2 x T Ax  b T x, where A is an n  n matrix. The gradient of f with respect to x is the function Ax  b. To ûnd the value of x that minimizes f , we set the gradient of f to 0 and solve for x. Solving Ax b D 0 for x, we obtain x D A 1 b, Thus, minimizing f .x/ is equivalent to solving Ax D b. If f .x/ is convex, then gradient descent can approximately compute this minimum. A 1-dimensional function is convex when its second derivative is positive. The equivalent deûnition for a multidimensional function is that it is convex when its 33.3 Gradient descent 1035 Hessian matrix is positive-semideûnite (see page 1222 for a deûnition), where the Hessian matrix .r 2 f /.x/ of a function f .x/ is the matrix in which entry .i; j / is the partial derivative of f with respect to i and j : .r 2 f /.x/ D â @ 2 f @x 1 @x 1 @ 2 f @x 1 @x 2    @ 2 f @x 1 @x n @ 2 f @x 2 @x 1 @ 2 f @x 2 @x 2    @ 2 f @x 2 @x n : : : : : : : : : : : : @ 2 f @x n @x 1 @ 2 f @x n @x 2    @ 2 f @x n @x n ã : Analogous to the 1-dimensional case, the Hessian of f is just A, and so if A is a positive-semideûnite matrix, then we can use gradient descent to ûnd a point x where Ax  b. If R and L are not too large, then this method is faster than using Gaussian elimination. Gradient descent in machine learning As a concrete example of supervised learning for prediction, suppose that you want to predict whether a patient will develop heart disease. For each of m patients, you have n different attributes. For example, you might have n D 4 and the four pieces of data are age, height, blood pressure, and number of close family members with heart disease. Denote the data for patient i as a vector x .i / 2 R n , with x .i / j giving the j th entry in vector x .i / . The label of patient i is denoted by a scalar y .i / 2 R, signifying the severity of the patient’s heart disease. The hypothesis should capture a relationship between the x .i / values and y .i / . For this example, we make the modeling assumption that the relationship is linear, and therefore the goal is to compute the <best= linear relationship between the x .i / values and y .i / : a linear function f W R n ! R such that f .x .i / /  y .i / for each patient i . Of course, no such function may exist, but you would like one that comes as close as possible. A linear function f can be deûned by a vector of weights w D .w 0 ; w 1 ; : : : ; w n /, with f .x/ D w 0 C n X j D1 w j x j : (33.32) When evaluating a machine-learning model, you need to measure how close each value f .x .i / / is to its corresponding label y .i / . In this example, we deûne the error e .i / 2 R associated with patient i as e .i / D f .x .i / /  y .i / . The objective function we choose is to minimize the sum of squares of the errors, which is 1036 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms m X i D1 ã e .i / ä 2 D m X i D1 ã f .x .i / /  y .i / ä 2 D m X i D1  w 0 C n X j D1 w j x .i / j  y .i / ! 2 : (33.33) The objective function is typically called the loss function, and the least-squares error given by equation (33.33) is just one example of many possible loss func- tions. The goal is then, given the x .i / and y .i / values, to compute the weights w 0 ; w 1 ; : : : ; w n so as to minimize the loss function in equation (33.33). The vari- ables here are the weights w 0 ; w 1 ; : : : ; w n and not the x .i / or y .i / values. This particular objective is sometimes known as a least-squares ﬁt, and the prob- lem of ûnding a linear function to ût data and minimize the least-squares error is called linear regression. Finding a least-squares ût is also addressed in Sec- tion 28.3. When the function f is linear, the loss function deûned in equation (33.33) is convex, because it is the sum of squares of linear functions, which are themselves convex. Therefore, we can apply gradient descent to compute a set of weights to approximately minimize the least-squares error. The concrete goal of learning is to be able to make predictions on new data. Informally, if the features are all reported in the same units and are from the same range (perhaps from being normalized), then the weights tend to have a natural interpretation because the features of the data that are better predictors of the label have a larger associated weight. For example, you would expect that, after normalization, the weight associated with the number of family members with heart disease would be larger than the weight associated with height. The computed weights form a model of the data. Once you have a model, you can make predictions, so that given new data, you can predict its label. In our example, given a new patient x 0 who is not part of the original training data set, you would still hope to predict the chance that the new patient develops heart disease. You can do so by computing the label f .x 0 /, incorporating the weights computed by gradient descent. For this linear-regression problem, the objective is to minimize the expression in equation (33.33), which is a quadratic in each of the nC1 weights w j . Thus, entry j in the gradient is linear in w j . Exercise 33.3-5 asks you to explicitly compute the gradient and see that it can be computed in O.nm/ time, which is linear in the input size. Compared with the exact method of solving equation (33.33) in Chapter 28, which needs to invert a matrix, gradient descent is typically much faster. Section 33.1 brieüy discussed regularization4the idea that a complicated hy- pothesis should be penalized in order to avoid overûtting the training data. Reg- ularization often involves adding a term to the objective function, but it can also 33.3 Gradient descent 1037 be achieved by adding a constraint. One way to regularize this example would be to explicitly limit the norm of the weights, adding a constraint that kw k හ B for some bound B > 0. (Recall again that the components of the vector w are the vari- ables in the present application.) Adding this constraint controls the complexity of the model, as the number of values w j that can have large absolute value is now limited. In order to run GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED for any problem, you need to implement the projection step, as well as to compute bounds on R and L. We conclude this section by describing these calculations for gradient descent with the constraint kw k හ B . First, consider the projection step in line 5. Suppose that the update in line 4 results in a vector w 0 . The projection is implemented by computing … k .w 0 / where K is deûned by kw k හ B . This particular pro- jection can be accomplished by simply scaling w 0 , since we know that closest point in K to w 0 must be the point along the vector whose norm is exactly B . The amount ´ by which we need to scale w 0 to hit the boundary of K is the so- lution to the equation ´ kw 0 k D B , which is solved by ´ D B= kw 0 k. Hence line 5 is implemented by computing w D w 0 B= kw 0 k. Because we always have kw k හ B , Exercise 33.3-6 asks you to show that the upper bound on the mag- nitude L of the gradient is O.B/. We also get a bound on R, as follows. By the constraint kw k හ B , we know that both kw .0/ k හ B and kw  k හ B , and thus kw .0/  w  k හ 2B . Using the deûnition of R in equation (33.20), we have R D O.B/. The bound RL= p T on the accuracy of the solution after T iterations in Theorem 33.11 becomes O.B/L= p T D O.B 2 = p T /. Exercises 33.3-1 Prove Lemma 33.6. Start from the deûnition of a convex function given in equa- tion (33.18). (Hint: You can prove the statement when n D 1 ûrst. The proof for general values of n is similar.) 33.3-2 Prove Lemma 33.7. 33.3-3 Prove equation (33.29). (Hint: The proof for n D 1 dimension is straightforward. The proof for general values of n dimensions follows along similar lines.) 33.3-4 Show that the function f in equation (33.32) is a convex function of the variables w 0 ; w 1 ; : : : ; w n . 1038 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms 33.3-5 Compute the gradient of expression (33.33) and explain how to evaluate the gradi- ent in O.nm/ time. 33.3-6 Consider the function f deûned in equation (33.32), and suppose that you have a bound kw k හ B , as is considered in the discussion on regularization. Show that L D O.B/ in this case. 33.3-7 Equation (33.2) on page 1009 gives a function that, when minimized, gives an optimal solution to the k-means problem. Explain how to use gradient descent to solve the k-means problem. Problems 33-1 Newton’s method Gradient descent iteratively moves closer to a desired value (the minimum) of a function. Another algorithm in this spirit is known as Newton’s method, which is an iterative algorithm that ûnds the root of a function. Here, we consider Newton’s method which, given a function f W R ! R, ûnds a value x  such that f .x  / D 0. The algorithm moves through a series of points x .0/ ; x .1/ ; : : :. If the algorithm is currently at a point x .t / , then to ûnd point x .t C1/ , it ûrst takes the equation of the line tangent to the curve at x D x .t / , y D f 0 .x .t / /.x  x .t / / C f .x .t / / : It then uses the x -intercept of this line as the next point x .t C1/ . a. Show that the algorithm described above can be summarized by the update rule x .t C1/ D x .t /  f .x .t / / f 0 .x .t / / : We restrict our attention to some domain I and assume that f 0 .x/ ¤ 0 for all x 2 I and that f 00 .x/ is continuous. We also assume that the starting point x .0/ is sufûciently close to x  , where <sufûciently close= means that we can use only the ûrst two terms of the Taylor expansion of f .x  / about x .0/ , namely f .x  / D f .x .0/ / C f 0 .x .0/ /.x   x .0/ / C 1 2 f 00 .� .0/ /.x   x .0/ / 2 ; (33.34) Problems for Chapter 33 1039 where � .0/ is some value between x .0/ and x  . If the approximation in equa- tion (33.34) holds for x .0/ , it also holds for any point closer to x  . b. Assume that the function f has exactly one point x  for which f .x  / D 0. Let � .t / D ˇ ˇ x .t /  x  ˇ ˇ . Using the Taylor expansion in equation (33.34), show that � .t C1/ D ˇ ˇ f 00 .� .t / / ˇ ˇ 2 jf 0 .� .t / /j � .t / ; where � .t / is some value between x .t / and x  . c. If ˇ ˇ f 00 .� .t / / ˇ ˇ 2 jf 0 .� .t / /j හ c for some constant c and � .0/ < 1, then we say that the function f has quadratic convergence, since the error decreases quadratically. Assuming that f has qua- dratic convergence, how many iterations are needed to ûnd a root of f .x/ to an accuracy of ı ? Your answer should include ı . d. Suppose you wish to ûnd a root of the function f .x/ D .x  3/ 2 , which is also the minimizer, and you start at x .0/ D 3:5. Compare the number of iterations needed by gradient descent to ûnd the minimizer and Newton’s method to ûnd the root. 33-2 Hedge Another variant in the multiplicative-weights framework is known as HEDGE. It differs from WEIGHTED MAJORITY in two ways. First, HEDGE makes the pre- diction randomly4in iteration t , it assigns a probability p .t / i D w .t / i =Z .t / to ex- pert E i , where Z .t / D P n i D1 w .t / i . It then chooses an expert E i 0 according to this probability distribution and predicts according to E i 0 . Second, the update rule is different. If an expert makes a mistake, line 16 updates that expert’s weight by the rule w .t C1/ i D w .t / i e  , for some 0 < � < 1. Show that the expected number of mistakes made by HEDGE, running for T rounds, is at most m  C .ln n/=� C �T . 33-3 Nonoptimality of Lloyd’s procedure in one dimension Give an example to show that even in one dimension, Lloyd’s procedure for ûnding clusters does not always return an optimum result. That is, Lloyd’s procedure may terminate and return as a result a set C of clusters that does not minimize f .S; C /, even when S is a set of points on a line. 1040 Chapter 33 Machine-Learning Algorithms 33-4 Stochastic gradient descent Consider the problem described in Section 33.3 of ûtting a line f .x/ D ax C b to a given set of point/value pairs S D f.x 1 ; y 1 /; :::; .x T ; y T /g by optimizing the choice of the parameters a and b using gradient descent to ûnd a best least-squares ût. Here we consider the case where x is a real-valued variable, rather than a vector. Suppose that you are not given the point/value pairs in S all at once, but only one at a time in an online manner. Furthermore, the points are given in random order. That is, you know that there are n points, but in iteration t you are given only .x i ; y i / where i is independently and randomly chosen from f1; : : : ; T g. You can use gradient descent to compute an estimate to the function. As each point .x i ; y i / is considered, you can update the current values of a and b by taking the derivative with respect to a and b of the term of the objective function depend- ing on .x i ; y i /. Doing so gives you a stochastic estimate of the gradient, and you can then take a small step in the opposite direction. Give pseudcode to implement this variant of gradient descent. What would the expected value of the error be as a function of T , L, and R? (Hint: Replicate the analysis of GRADIENT-DESCENT in Section 33.3 for this variant.) This procedure and its variants are known as stochastic gradient descent. Chapter notes For a general introduction to artiûcial intelligence, we recommend Russell and Norvig [391]. For a general introduction to machine learning, we recommend Murphy [340]. Lloyd’s procedure for the k-means problem was ûrst proposed by Lloyd [304] and also later by Forgy [151]. It is sometimes called <Lloyd’ s algorithm= or the <Lloyd-Forgy algorithm.= Although Mahajan et al. [310] showed that ûnding an optimal clustering is NP-hard, even in the plane, Kanungo et al. [241] have shown that there is an approximation algorithm for the k-means problem with approxima- tion ratio 9 C � , for any � > 0. The multiplicative-weights method is surveyed by Arora, Hazan, and Kale [25]. The main idea of updating weights based on feedback has been rediscovered many times. One early use is in game theory, where Brown deûned <Fictitious Play= [74] and conjectured its convergence to the value of a zero-sum game. The convergence properties were established by Robinson [382]. In machine learning, the ûrst use of multiplicative weights was by Littlestone in the Winnow algorithm [300], which was later extended by Littlestone and Warmuth to the weighted-majority algorithm described in Section 33.2 [301]. This work is closely connected to the boosting algorithm, originally due to Freund and Shapire Notes for Chapter 33 1041 [159]. The multiplicative-weights idea is also closely related to several more gen- eral optimization algorithms, including the perceptron algorithm [328] and algo- rithms for optimization problems such as packing linear programs [177, 359]. The treatment of gradient descent in this chapter draws heavily on the unpub- lished manuscript of Bansal and Gupta [35]. They emphasize the idea of using a potential function and using ideas from amortized analysis to explain gradient descent. Other presentations and analyses of gradient descent include works by Bubeck [75], Boyd and Vanderberghe [69], and Nesterov [343]. Gradient descent is known to converge faster when functions obey stronger prop- erties than general convexity. For example, a function f is ˛-strongly convex if f .y /  f .x/ C h.r f /.x/; .y  x/i C ˛ ky  xk for all x; y 2 R n . In this case, GRADIENT-DESCENT can use a variable step size and return x .T / . The step size at step t becomes � t D 1=.˛.t C 1//, and the procedure returns a point such that f .x-avg/  f .x  / හ L 2 =.˛.T C 1//. This convergence is better than that of The- orem 33.8 because the number of iterations needed is linear, rather than quadratic, in the desired error parameter � , and because the performance is independent of the initial point. Another case in which gradient descent can be shown to perform better than the analysis in Section 33.3 suggests is for smooth convex functions. We say that a function is ˇ-smooth if f .y / හ f .x/ Ch.r f /.x/; .y  x/iC ˇ 2 ky  xk 2 . This in- equality goes in the opposite direction from the one for ˛-strong convexity. Better bounds on gradient descent are possible here as well. 34 NP-Completeness Almost all the algorithms we have studied thus far have been polynomial-time algorithms: on inputs of size n, their worst-case running time is O.n k / for some constant k. You might wonder whether all problems can be solved in polynomial time. The answer is no. For example, there are problems, such as Turing’s famous <Halting Problem,= that cannot be solved by any computer, no matter how long you’re willing to wait for an answer. 1 There are also problems that can be solved, but not in O.n k / time for any constant k. Generally, we think of problems that are solvable by polynomial-time algorithms as being tractable, or <easy,= and problems that require superpolynomial time as being intractable, or <hard.= The subject of this chapter, however, is an interesting class of problems, called the <NP-complete= problems, whose status is unknown. No polynomial-time al- gorithm has yet been discovered for an NP-complete problem, nor has anyone yet been able to prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can exist for any one of them. This so-called P ¤ NP question has been one of the deepest, most perplexing open research problems in theoretical computer science since it was ûrst posed in 1971. Several NP-complete problems are particularly tantalizing because they seem on the surface to be similar to problems that we know how to solve in polynomial time. In each of the following pairs of problems, one is solvable in polynomial time and the other is NP-complete, but the difference between the problems appears to be slight: Shortest versus longest simple paths: In Chapter 22, we saw that even with neg- ative edge weights, we can ûnd shortest paths from a single source in a directed 1 For the Halting Problem and other unsolvable problems, there are proofs that no algorithm can exist that, for every input, eventually produces the correct answer. A procedure attempting to solve an unsolvable problem might always produce an answer but is sometimes incorrect, or all the answers it produces might be correct but for some inputs it never produces an answer. Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 1043 graph G D .V; E/ in O.VE/ time. Finding a longest simple path between two vertices is difûcult, however. Merely determining whether a graph contains a simple path with at least a given number of edges is NP-complete. Euler tour versus hamiltonian cycle: An Euler tour of a strongly connected, directed graph G D .V; E/ is a cycle that traverses each edge of G exactly once, although it is allowed to visit each vertex more than once. Problem 20-3 on page 583 asks you to show how to determine whether a strongly connected, directed graph has an Euler tour and, if it does, the order of the edges in the Eu- ler tour, all in O.E/ time. A hamiltonian cycle of a directed graph G D .V; E/ is a simple cycle that contains each vertex in V . Determining whether a di- rected graph has a hamiltonian cycle is NP-complete. (Later in this chapter, we’ll prove that determining whether an undirected graph has a hamiltonian cycle is NP-complete.) 2-CNF satisﬁability versus 3-CNF satisﬁability: Boolean formulas contain bi- nary variables whose values are 0 or 1; boolean connectives such as ^ (AND), _ (OR), and : (NOT); and parentheses. A boolean formula is satisﬁable if there exists some assignment of the values 0 and 1 to its variables that causes it to evaluate to 1. We’ll deûne terms more formally later in this chapter, but informally, a boolean formula is in k-conjunctive normal form, or k-CNF if it is the AND of clauses of ORs of exactly k variables or their negations. For example, the boolean formula .x 1 _ x 2 / ^ .:x 1 _ x 3 / ^ .:x 2 _ :x 3 / is in 2-CNF (with satisfying assignment x 1 D 1, x 2 D 0, and x 3 D 1). Although there is a polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a 2-CNF formula is satisûable, we’ll see later in this chapter that determining whether a 3-CNF formula is satisûable is NP-complete. NP-completeness and the classes P and NP Throughout this chapter, we refer to three classes of problems: P, NP, and NPC, the latter class being the NP-complete problems. We describe them informally here, with formal deûnitions to appear later on. The class P consists of those problems that are solvable in polynomial time. More speciûcally, they are problems that can be solved in O.n k / time for some constant k, where n is the size of the input to the problem. Most of the problems examined in previous chapters belong to P. The class NP consists of those problems that are <veriûable= in polynomial time. What do we mean by a problem being veriûable? If you were somehow given a <certiûcate= of a solution, then you could verify that the certiûcate is correct in time polynomial in the size of the input to the problem. For example, in the hamiltonian-cycle problem, given a directed graph G D .V; E/, a certiûcate would 1044 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness be a sequence hv 1 ; v 2 ; v 3 ; : : : ; v jV j i of jV j vertices. You could check in polyno- mial time that the sequence contains each of the jV j vertices exactly once, that .v i ; v i C1 / 2 E for i D 1; 2; 3; : : : ; jV j  1, and that .v jV j ; v 1 / 2 E. As another example, for 3-CNF satisûability, a certiûcate could be an assignment of values to variables. You could check in polynomial time that this assignment satisûes the boolean formula. Any problem in P also belongs to NP, since if a problem belongs to P then it is solvable in polynomial time without even being supplied a certiûcate. We’ll formalize this notion later in this chapter, but for now you can believe that P ෂ NP. The famous open question is whether P is a proper subset of NP. Informally, a problem belongs to the class NPC4and we call it NP-complete 4if it belongs to NP and is as <hard= as any problem in NP. We’ll formally de- ûne what it means to be as hard as any problem in NP later in this chapter. In the meantime, we state without proof that if any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP has a polynomial-time algorithm. Most theoretical computer scientists believe that the NP-complete problems are intractable, since given the wide range of NP-complete problems that have been studied to date4without anyone having discovered a polynomial-time solution to any of them4it would be truly astounding if all of them could be solved in poly- nomial time. Yet, given the effort devoted thus far to proving that NP-complete problems are intractable4without a conclusive outcome4we cannot rule out the possibility that the NP-complete problems could turn out to be solvable in polyno- mial time. To become a good algorithm designer, you must understand the rudiments of the theory of NP-completeness. If you can establish a problem as NP-complete, you provide good evidence for its intractability. As an engineer, you would then do better to spend your time developing an approximation algorithm (see Chapter 35) or solving a tractable special case, rather than searching for a fast algorithm that solves the problem exactly. Moreover, many natural and interesting problems that on the surface seem no harder than sorting, graph searching, or network üow are in fact NP-complete. Therefore, you should become familiar with this remarkable class of problems. Overview of showing problems to be NP-complete The techniques used to show that a particular problem is NP-complete differ fun- damentally from the techniques used throughout most of this book to design and analyze algorithms. If you can demonstrate that a problem is NP-complete, you are making a statement about how hard it is (or at least how hard we think it is), rather than about how easy it is. If you prove a problem NP-complete, you are say- ing that searching for efûcient algorithm is likely to be a fruitless endeavor. In this Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 1045 way, NP-completeness proofs bear some similarity to the proof in Section 8.1 of an �.n lg n/-time lower bound for any comparison sort algorithm, although the spe- ciûc techniques used for showing NP-completeness differ from the decision-tree method used in Section 8.1. We rely on three key concepts in showing a problem to be NP-complete: Decision problems versus optimization problems Many problems of interest are optimization problems, in which each feasible (i.e., <legal=) solution has an associated value, and the goal is to ûnd a feasible solution with the best value. For example, in a problem that we call SHORTEST-PATH, the input is an undirected graph G and vertices u and v, and the goal is to ûnd a path from u to v that uses the fewest edges. In other words, SHORTEST-PATH is the single-pair shortest-path problem in an unweighted, undirected graph. NP- completeness applies directly not to optimization problems, however, but to deci- sion problems, in which the answer is simply <yes= or <no= (or, more formally, <1= or <0=). Although NP-complete problems are conûned to the realm of decision problems, there is usually a way to cast a given optimization problem as a related decision problem by imposing a bound on the value to be optimized. For example, a deci- sion problem related to SHORTEST-PATH is PATH: given an undirected graph G, vertices u and v, and an integer k, does a path exist from u to v consisting of at most k edges? The relationship between an optimization problem and its related decision prob- lem works in your favor when you try to show that the optimization problem is <hard.= That is because the decision problem is in a sense <easier,= or at least <no harder.= As a speciûc example, you can solve PATH by solving SHORTEST-PATH and then comparing the number of edges in the shortest path found to the value of the decision-problem parameter k. In other words, if an optimization prob- lem is easy, its related decision problem is easy as well. Stated in a way that has more relevance to NP-completeness, if you can provide evidence that a decision problem is hard, you also provide evidence that its related optimization problem is hard. Thus, even though it restricts attention to decision problems, the theory of NP-completeness often has implications for optimization problems as well. Reductions The above notion of showing that one problem is no harder or no easier than an- other applies even when both problems are decision problems. Almost every NP- completeness proof takes advantage of this idea, as follows. Consider a decision problem A, which you would like to solve in polynomial time. We call the input to a particular problem an instance of that problem. For example, in PATH, an 1046 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness instance ˛ of A instance ˇ of B yes no yes no polynomial-time algorithm to decide A polynomial-time reduction algorithm polynomial-time algorithm to decide B Figure 34.1 How to use a polynomial-time reduction algorithm to solve a d ecision problem A in polynomial time, given a polynomial-time decision algorithm for another problem B. In polynomial time, transform an instance ˛ of A into an instance ˇ of B, solve B in polynomial time, and use the answer for ˇ as the answer for ˛. instance is a particular graph G, particular vertices u and v of G, and a particular integer k. Now suppose that you already know how to solve a different decision problem B in polynomial time. Finally, suppose that you have a procedure that transforms any instance ˛ of A into some instance ˇ of B with the following char- acteristics: The transformation takes polynomial time.  The answers are the same. That is, the answer for ˛ is <yes= if and only if the answer for ˇ is also <yes.= We call such a procedure a polynomial-time reduction algorithm and, as Fig- ure 34.1 shows, it provides us a way to solve problem A in polynomial time: 1. Given an instance ˛ of problem A, use a polynomial-time reduction algorithm to transform it to an instance ˇ of problem B . 2. Run the polynomial-time decision algorithm for B on the instance ˇ. 3. Use the answer for ˇ as the answer for ˛. As long as each of these steps takes polynomial time, all three together do also, and so you have a way to decide on ˛ in polynomial time. In other words, by <reducing= solving problem A to solving problem B , you use the <easiness= of B to prove the <easiness= of A. Recalling that NP-completeness is about showing how hard a problem is rather than how easy it is, you use polynomial-time reductions in the opposite way to show that a problem is NP-complete. Let’s take the idea a step further and show how you can use polynomial-time reductions to show that no polynomial-time al- gorithm can exist for a particular problem B . Suppose that you have a decision problem A for which you already know that no polynomial-time algorithm can exist. (Ignore for the moment how to ûnd such a problem A.) Suppose further that you have a polynomial-time reduction transforming instances of A to instances of B . Now you can use a simple proof by contradiction to show that no polynomial- time algorithm can exist for B . Suppose otherwise, that is, suppose that B has a Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 1047 polynomial-time algorithm. Then, using the method shown in Figure 34.1, you would have a way to solve problem A in polynomial time, which contradicts the assumption that there is no polynomial-time algorithm for A. To prove that a problem B is NP-complete, the methodology is similar. Al- though you cannot assume that there is absolutely no polynomial-time algorithm for problem A, you prove that problem B is NP-complete on the assumption that problem A is also NP-complete. A ﬁrst NP-complete problem Because the technique of reduction relies on having a problem already known to be NP-complete in order to prove a different problem NP-complete, there must be some <ûrst= NP-complete problem. We’ll use the circuit-satisûability problem, in which the input is a boolean combinational circuit composed of AND, OR, and NOT gates, and the question is whether there exists some set of boolean inputs to this circuit that causes its output to be 1. Section 34.3 will prove that this ûrst problem is NP-complete. Chapter outline This chapter studies the aspects of NP-completeness that bear most directly on the analysis of algorithms. Section 34.1 formalizes the notion of <problem= and de- ûnes the complexity class P of polynomial-time solvable decision problems. We’ll also see how these notions ût into the framework of formal-language theory. Sec- tion 34.2 deûnes the class NP of decision problems whose solutions are veriûable in polynomial time. It also formally poses the P ¤ NP question. Section 34.3 shows how to relate problems via polynomial-time <reductions.= It deûnes NP-completeness and sketches a proof that the circuit-satisûability prob- lem is NP-complete. With one problem proven NP-complete, Section 34.4 demon- strates how to prove other problems to be NP-complete much more simply by the methodology of reductions. To illustrate this methodology, the section shows that two formula-satisûability problems are NP-complete. Section 34.5 proves a variety of other problems to be NP-complete by using reductions. You will probably ûnd several of these reductions to be quite creative, because they convert a problem in one domain to a problem in a completely different domain. 1048 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 34.1 Polynomial time Since NP-completeness relies on notions of solving a problem and verifying a cer- tiûcate in polynomial time, let’s ûrst examine what it means for a problem to be solvable in polynomial time. Recall that we generally regard problems that have polynomial-time solutions as tractable. Here are three reasons why: 1. Although no reasonable person considers a problem that requires ‚.n 100 / time to be tractable, few practical problems require time on the order of such a high- degree polynomial. The polynomial-time computable problems encountered in practice typically require much less time. Experience has shown that once the ûrst polynomial-time algorithm for a problem has been discovered, more efû- cient algorithms often follow. Even if the current best algorithm for a problem has a running time of ‚.n 100 /, an algorithm with a much better running time will likely soon be discovered. 2. For many reasonable models of computation, a problem that can be solved in polynomial time in one model can be solved in polynomial time in another. For example, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by the serial random-access machine used throughout most of this book is the same as the class of problems solvable in polynomial time on abstract Turing machines. 2 It is also the same as the class of problems solvable in polynomial time on a parallel computer when the number of processors grows polynomially with the input size. 3. The class of polynomial-time solvable problems has nice closure properties, since polynomials are closed under addition, multiplication, and composition. For example, if the output of one polynomial-time algorithm is fed into the input of another, the composite algorithm is polynomial. Exercise 34.1-5 asks you to show that if an algorithm makes a constant number of calls to polynomial-time subroutines and performs an additional amount of work that also takes polyno- mial time, then the running time of the composite algorithm is polynomial. Abstract problems To understand the class of polynomial-time solvable problems, you must ûrst have a formal notion of what a <problem= is. We deûne an abstract problem Q to be a 2 See the books by Hopcroft and Ullman [228], Lewis and Papadimitriou [299], or Sipser [413] for a thorough treatment of the Turing-machine model. 34.1 Polynomial time 1049 binary relation on a set I of problem instances and a set S of problem solutions. For example, an instance for SHORTEST-PATH is a triple consisting of a graph and two vertices. A solution is a sequence of vertices in the graph, with perhaps the empty sequence denoting that no path exists. The problem SHORTEST-PATH itself is the relation that associates each instance of a graph and two vertices with a shortest path in the graph that connects the two vertices. Since shortest paths are not necessarily unique, a given problem instance may have more than one solution. This formulation of an abstract problem is more general than necessary for our purposes. As we saw above, the theory of NP-completeness restricts attention to decision problems: those having a yes/no solution. In this case, we can view an abstract decision problem as a function that maps the instance set I to the solution set f0; 1g. For example, a decision problem related to SHORTEST-PATH is the problem PATH that we saw earlier. If i D hG; u; v; ki is an instance of PATH, then PATH.i / D 1 (yes) if G contains a path from u to v with at most k edges, and PATH.i / D 0 (no) otherwise. Many abstract problems are not decision problems, but rather optimization problems, which require some value to be minimized or maximized. As we saw above, however, you can usually recast an optimization problem as a decision problem that is no harder. Encodings In order for a computer program to solve an abstract problem, its problem instances must appear in a way that the program understands. An encoding of a set S of abstract objects is a mapping e from S to the set of binary strings. 3 For example, we are all familiar with encoding the natural numbers N D f0; 1; 2; 3; 4; : : : g as the strings f0; 1; 10; 11; 100; : : : g. Using this encoding, e.17/ D 10001. If you have looked at computer representations of keyboard characters, you probably have seen the ASCII code, where, for example, the encoding of A is 01000001. You can encode a compound object as a binary string by combining the representations of its constituent parts. Polygons, graphs, functions, ordered pairs, programs4all can be encoded as binary strings. Thus, a computer algorithm that <solves= some abstract decision problem actu- ally takes an encoding of a problem instance as input. The size of an instance i is just the length of its string, which we denote by ji j. We call a problem whose instance set is the set of binary strings a concrete problem. We say that an algo- rithm solves a concrete problem in O.T .n// time if, when it is provided a problem instance i of length n D ji j, the algorithm can produce the solution in O.T .n// 3 The codomain of e need not be binary strings: any set of strings over a ûnite alphabet having at least two symbols will do. 1050 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness time. 4 A concrete problem is polynomial-time solvable, therefore, if there exists an algorithm to solve it in O.n k / time for some constant k. We can now formally deûne the complexity class P as the set of concrete deci- sion problems that are polynomial-time solvable. Encodings map abstract problems to concrete problems. Given an abstract deci- sion problem Q mapping an instance set I to f0; 1g, an encoding e W I ! f0; 1g  can induce a related concrete decision problem, which we denote by e.Q/. 5 If the solution to an abstract-problem instance i 2 I is Q.i / 2 f0; 1g, then the solution to the concrete-problem instance e.i / 2 f0; 1g  is also Q.i /. As a technicality, some binary strings might represent no meaningful abstract-problem instance. For convenience, assume that any such string maps arbitrarily to 0. Thus, the con- crete problem produces the same solutions as the abstract problem on binary-string instances that represent the encodings of abstract-problem instances. We would like to extend the deûnition of polynomial-time solvability from con- crete problems to abstract problems by using encodings as the bridge, ideally with the deûnition independent of any particular encoding. That is, the efûciency of solving a problem should not depend on how the problem is encoded. Unfortu- nately, it depends quite heavily on the encoding. For example, suppose that the sole input to an algorithm is an integer k, and suppose that the running time of the algorithm is ‚.k/. If the integer k is provided in unary4a string of k 1s4then the running time of the algorithm is O.n/ on length-n inputs, which is polynomial time. If the input k is provided using the more natural binary representation, how- ever, then the input length is n D blg kc C 1, so the size of the unary encoding is exponential in the size of the binary encoding. With the binary representation, the running time of the algorithm is ‚.k/ D ‚.2 n /, which is exponential in the size of the input. Thus, depending on the encoding, the algorithm runs in either polynomial or superpolynomial time. The encoding of an abstract problem matters quite a bit to how we understand polynomial time. We cannot really talk about solving an abstract problem without ûrst specifying an encoding. Nevertheless, in practice, if we rule out <expensive= encodings such as unary ones, the actual encoding of a problem makes little dif- ference to whether the problem can be solved in polynomial time. For example, representing integers in base 3 instead of binary has no effect on whether a prob- lem is solvable in polynomial time, since we can convert an integer represented in base 3 to an integer represented in base 2 in polynomial time. 4 We assume that the algorithm’s output is separate from its input. Because it takes at least one time step to produce each bit of the output and the algorithm takes O.T .n// time steps, the size of the output is O.T .n//. 5 The notation f0; 1g  denotes the set of all strings composed of symbols from the set f0; 1g. 34.1 Polynomial time 1051 We say that a function f W f0; 1g  ! f0; 1g  is polynomial-time computable if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A that, given any input x 2 f0; 1g  , produces as output f .x/. For some set I of problem instances, we say that two en- codings e 1 and e 2 are polynomially related if there exist two polynomial-time com- putable functions f 12 and f 21 such that for any i 2 I , we have f 12 .e 1 .i // D e 2 .i / and f 21 .e 2 .i // D e 1 .i /. 6 That is, a polynomial-time algorithm can compute the en- coding e 2 .i / from the encoding e 1 .i /, and vice versa. If two encodings e 1 and e 2 of an abstract problem are polynomially related, whether the problem is polynomial- time solvable or not is independent of which encoding we use, as the following lemma shows. Lemma 34.1 Let Q be an abstract decision problem on an instance set I , and let e 1 and e 2 be polynomially related encodings on I . Then, e 1 .Q/ 2 P if and only if e 2 .Q/ 2 P. Proof We need only prove the forward direction, since the backward direction is symmetric. Suppose, therefore, that e 1 .Q/ can be solved in O.n k / time for some constant k. Furthermore, suppose that for any problem instance i , the en- coding e 1 .i / can be computed from the encoding e 2 .i / in O.n c / time for some constant c , where n D je 2 .i /j. To solve problem e 2 .Q/ on input e 2 .i /, ûrst com- pute e 1 .i / and then run the algorithm for e 1 .Q/ on e 1 .i /. How long does this proce- dure take? Converting encodings takes O.n c / time, and therefore je 1 .i /j D O.n c /, since the output of a serial computer cannot be longer than its running time. Solv- ing the problem on e 1 .i / takes O.je 1 .i /j k / D O.n ck / time, which is polynomial since both c and k are constants. Thus, whether an abstract problem has its instances encoded in binary or base 3 does not affect its <complexity,= that is, whether it is polynomial-time solvable or not. If instances are encoded in unary, however, its complexity may change. In order to be able to converse in an encoding-independent fashion, we generally as- sume that problem instances are encoded in any reasonable, concise fashion, unless we speciûcally say otherwise. To be precise, we assume that the encoding of an integer is polynomially related to its binary representation, and that the encoding of a ûnite set is polynomially related to its encoding as a list of its elements, enclosed in braces and separated by commas. (ASCII is one such encoding scheme.) With 6 Technically, we also require the functions f 12 and f 21 to <map noninstances to noninstances.= A noninstance of an encoding e is a string x 2 f0; 1g  such that there is no instance i for which e.i/ D x. We require that f 12 .x/ D y for every noninstance x of encoding e 1 , where y is some non- instance of e 2 , and that f 21 .x 0 / D y 0 for every noninstance x 0 of e 2 , where y 0 is some noninstance of e 1 . 1052 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness such a <standard= encoding in hand, we can derive reasonable encodings of other mathematical objects, such as tuples, graphs, and formulas. To denote the standard encoding of an object, we enclose the object in angle brackets. Thus, hGi denotes the standard encoding of a graph G. As long as the encoding implicitly used is polynomially related to this standard encoding, we can talk directly about abstract problems without reference to any particular encoding, knowing that the choice of encoding has no effect on whether the abstract problem is polynomial-time solvable. From now on, we will generally assume that all problem instances are binary strings encoded using the standard encoding, unless we explicitly specify the contrary. We’ll also typically neglect the distinction between abstract and concrete problems. You should watch out for problems that arise in practice, however, in which a standard encoding is not obvious and the encoding does make a difference. formal-language framework By focusing on decision problems, we can take advantage of the machinery of formal-language theory. Let’s review some deûnitions from that theory. An al- phabet † is a ûnite set of symbols. A language L over † is any set of strings made up of symbols from †. For example, if † D f0; 1g, the set L D f10; 11; 101; 111; 1011; 1101; 10001; : : : g is the language of binary representations of prime numbers. We denote the empty string by \", the empty language by ;, and the language of all strings over † by †  . For example, if † D f0; 1g, then †  D f\"; 0; 1; 00; 01; 10; 11; 000; : : : g is the set of all binary strings. Every lan- guage L over † is a subset of †  . Languages support a variety of operations. Set-theoretic operations, such as union and intersection, follow directly from the set-theoretic deûnitions. We de- ûne the complement of a language L by L D †   L. The concatenation L 1 L 2 of two languages L 1 and L 2 is the language L D fx 1 x 2 W x 1 2 L 1 and x 2 2 L 2 g : The closure or Kleene star of a language L is the language L  D f\"g [ L [ L 2 [ L 3 [    ; where L k is the language obtained by concatenating L to itself k times. From the point of view of language theory, the set of instances for any decision problem Q is simply the set †  , where † D f0; 1g. Since Q is entirely character- ized by those problem instances that produce a 1 (yes) answer, we can view Q as a language L over † D f0; 1g, where L D fx 2 †  W Q.x/ D 1g : 34.1 Polynomial time 1053 For example, the decision problem PATH has the corresponding language PATH D fhG; u; v; ki W G D .V; E/ is an undirected graph, u; v 2 V; k  0 is an integer, and G contains a path from u to v with at most k edgesg : (Where convenient, we’ll sometimes use the same name4PATH in this case4to refer to both a decision problem and its corresponding language.) The formal-language framework allows us to express concisely the relation be- tween decision problems and algorithms that solve them. We say that an al- gorithm A accepts a string x 2 f0; 1g  if, given input x , the algorithm’s out- put A.x/ is 1. The language accepted by an algorithm A is the set of strings L D fx 2 f0; 1g  W A.x/ D 1g, that is, the set of strings that the algorithm accepts. An algorithm A rejects a string x if A.x/ D 0. Even if language L is accepted by an algorithm A, the algorithm does not nec- essarily reject a string x … L provided as input to it. For example, the algorithm might loop forever. A language L is decided by an algorithm A if every binary string in L is accepted by A and every binary string not in L is rejected by A. A language L is accepted in polynomial time by an algorithm A if it is accepted by A and if in addition there exists a constant k such that for any length-n string x 2 L, algorithm A accepts x in O.n k / time. A language L is decided in polynomial time by an algorithm A if there exists a constant k such that for any length-n string x 2 f0; 1g  , the algorithm correctly decides whether x 2 L in O.n k / time. Thus, to accept a language, an algorithm need only produce an answer when pro- vided a string in L, but to decide a language, it must correctly accept or reject every string in f0; 1g  . As an example, the language PATH can be accepted in polynomial time. One polynomial-time accepting algorithm veriûes that G encodes an undirected graph, veriûes that u and v are vertices in G, uses breadth-ûrst search to compute a path from u to v in G with the fewest edges, and then compares the number of edges on the path obtained with k. If G encodes an undirected graph and the path found from u to v has at most k edges, the algorithm outputs 1 and halts. Otherwise, the algorithm runs forever. This algorithm does not decide PATH, however, since it does not explicitly output 0 for instances in which a shortest path has more than k edges. A decision algorithm for PATH must explicitly reject binary strings that do not belong to PATH. For a decision problem such as PATH, such a decision algorithm is straightforward to design: instead of running forever when there is not a path from u to v with at most k edges, it outputs 0 and halts. (It must also output 0 and halt if the input encoding is faulty.) For other problems, such as Turing’s Halting Problem, there exists an accepting algorithm, but no decision algorithm exists. 1054 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness We can informally deûne a complexity class as a set of languages, membership in which is determined by a complexity measure, such as running time, of an algorithm that determines whether a given string x belongs to language L. The actual deûnition of a complexity class is somewhat more technical. 7 Using this language-theoretic framework, we can provide an alternative deûni- tion of the complexity class P: P D fL ෂ f0; 1g  W there exists an algorithm A that decides L in polynomial timeg : In fact, as the following theorem shows, P is also the class of languages that can be accepted in polynomial time. Theorem 34.2 P D fL W L is accepted by a polynomial-time algorithmg : Proof Because the class of languages decided by polynomial-time algorithms is a subset of the class of languages accepted by polynomial-time algorithms, we need only show that if L is accepted by a polynomial-time algorithm, it is decided by a polynomial-time algorithm. Let L be the language accepted by some polynomial- time algorithm A. We use a classic <simulation= argument to construct another polynomial-time algorithm A 0 that decides L. Because A accepts L in O.n k / time for some constant k, there also exists a constant c such that A accepts L in at most cn k steps. For any input string x , the algorithm A 0 simulates cn k steps of A. After simulating cn k steps, algorithm A 0 inspects the behavior of A. If A has accepted x , then A 0 accepts x by outputting a 1. If A has not accepted x , then A 0 rejects x by outputting a 0. The overhead of A 0 simulating A does not increase the running time by more than a polynomial factor, and thus A 0 is a polynomial-time algorithm that decides L. The proof of Theorem 34.2 is nonconstructive. For a given language L 2 P, we may not actually know a bound on the running time for the algorithm A that accepts L. Nevertheless, we know that such a bound exists, and therefore, that an algorithm A 0 exists that can check the bound, even though we may not be able to ûnd the algorithm A 0 easily. 7 For more on complexity classes, see the seminal paper by Hartmanis and Stearns [210]. 34.1 Polynomial time 1055 Exercises 34.1-1 Deûne the optimization problem LONGEST-PATH-LENGTH as the relation that associates each instance of an undirected graph and two vertices with the num- ber of edges in a longest simple path between the two vertices.

For example, suppose that for a given instance hG; u; v; ki of the decision problem PATH, you are also given a path p from u to v. You can check whether p is a path in G and whether the length of p is at most k, and if so, you can view p as a <certiûcate= that the instance indeed belongs to PATH. For the decision problem PATH, this certiûcate doesn’t seem to buy much. After all, PATH belongs to P4in fact, you can solve PATH in linear time4and so verifying membership from a given cer- tiûcate takes as long as solving the problem from scratch. Instead, let’s examine a problem for which we know of no polynomial-time decision algorithm and yet, given a certiûcate, veriûcation is easy. Hamiltonian cycles The problem of ûnding a hamiltonian cycle in an undirected graph has been stud- ied for over a hundred years. Formally, a hamiltonian cycle of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a simple cycle that contains each vertex in V . A graph that contains a hamiltonian cycle is said to be hamiltonian, and otherwise, it is nonhamilto- nian. The name honors W. R. Hamilton, who described a mathematical game on the dodecahedron (Figure 34.2(a)) in which one player sticks ûve pins in any ûve consecutive vertices and the other player must complete the path to form a cycle containing all the vertices. 8 The dodecahedron is hamiltonian, and Figure 34.2(a) shows one hamiltonian cycle. Not all graphs are hamiltonian, however. For ex- ample, Figure 34.2(b) shows a bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices. Exercise 34.2-2 asks you to show that all such graphs are nonhamiltonian. Here is how to deûne the hamiltonian-cycle problem, <Does a graph G have a hamiltonian cycle?= as a formal language: HAM-CYCLE D fhGi W G is a hamiltonian graphg : How might an algorithm decide the language HAM-CYCLE? Given a problem instance hGi, one possible decision algorithm lists all permutations of the vertices of G and then checks each permutation to see whether it is a hamiltonian cycle. 8 In a letter dated 17 October 1856 to his friend John T. Graves, Hamilton [206, p. 624] wrote, <I have found that some young persons have been much amused by trying a new mathematical game which the Icosion furnishes, one person sticking ûve pins in any ûve consecutive points . . . and the other player then aiming to insert, which by the theory in thi s letter can always be done, ûfteen other pins, in cyclical succession, so as to cover all the other points, and to end in immediate proximity to the pin wherewith his antagonist had begun.= 34.2 Polynomial-time veriﬁcation 1057 (a) (b) Figure 34.2 (a) A graph representing the vertices, edges, and faces of a dodecahedron, with a hamiltonian cycle shown by edges highlighted in blue. (b) A bipartite graph with an odd number of vertices. Any such graph is nonhamiltonian. What is the running time of this algorithm? It depends on the encoding of the graph G. Let’s say that G is encoded as its adjacency matrix. If the adjacency matrix contains n entries, so that the length of the encoding of G equals n, then the number m of vertices in the graph is �. p n/. There are mŠ possible permutations of the vertices, and therefore the running time is �.mŠ/ D �. p n Š/ D �.2 p n /, which is not O.n k / for any constant k. Thus, this naive algorithm does not run in polynomial time. In fact, the hamiltonian-cycle problem is NP-complete, as we’ll prove in Section 34.5. Veriﬁcation algorithms Consider a slightly easier problem. Suppose that a friend tells you that a given graph G is hamiltonian, and then the friend offers to prove it by giving you the vertices in order along the hamiltonian cycle. It would certainly be easy enough to verify the proof: simply verify that the provided cycle is hamiltonian by checking whether it is a permutation of the vertices of V and whether each of the consecutive edges along the cycle actually exists in the graph. You could certainly implement this veriûcation algorithm to run in O.n 2 / time, where n is the length of the encod- ing of G. Thus, a proof that a hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph can be veriûed in polynomial time. 1058 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness We deûne a veriﬁcation algorithm as being a two-argument algorithm A, where one argument is an ordinary input string x and the other is a binary string y called a certiﬁcate. A two-argument algorithm A veriﬁes an input string x if there exists a certiûcate y such that A.x; y/ D 1. The language veriﬁed by a veriûcation algorithm A is L D fx 2 f0; 1g  W there exists y 2 f0; 1g  such that A.x; y/ D 1g : Think of an algorithm A as verifying a language L if, for any string x 2 L, there exists a certiûcate y that A can use to prove that x 2 L. Moreover, for any string x … L, there must be no certiûcate proving that x 2 L. For example, in the hamiltonian-cycle problem, the certiûcate is the list of vertices in some hamil- tonian cycle. If a graph is hamiltonian, the hamiltonian cycle itself offers enough information to verify that the graph is indeed hamiltonian. Conversely, if a graph is not hamiltonian, there can be no list of vertices that fools the veriûcation algo- rithm into believing that the graph is hamiltonian, since the veriûcation algorithm carefully checks the so-called cycle to be sure. The complexity class NP The complexity class NP is the class of languages that can be veriûed by a poly- nomial-time algorithm. 9 More precisely, a language L belongs to NP if and only if there exist a two-input polynomial-time algorithm A and a constant c such that L D fx 2 f0; 1g  W there exists a certiûcate y with jy j D O.jx j c / such that A.x; y/ D 1g : We say that algorithm A veriﬁes language L in polynomial time. From our earlier discussion about the hamiltonian-cycle problem, you can see that HAM-CYCLE 2 NP. (It is always nice to know that an important set is nonempty.) Moreover, if L 2 P, then L 2 NP, since if there is a polynomial- time algorithm to decide L, the algorithm can be converted to a two-argument veriûcation algorithm that simply ignores any certiûcate and accepts exactly those input strings it determines to belong to L. Thus, P ෂ NP. That leaves the question of whether P D NP. A deûnitive answer is unknown, but most researchers believe that P and NP are not the same class. Think of the class P as consisting of problems that can be solved quickly and the class NP as 9 The name <NP= stands for <nondeterministic polynomial time.= The class NP was originally stud- ied in the context of nondeterminism, but this book uses the somewhat simpler yet equivalent notion of veriûcation. Hopcroft and Ullman [228] give a good presentation of NP-completeness in terms of nondeterministic models of computation. 34.2 Polynomial-time veriﬁcation 1059 co-NP NP (c) P = NP ∩ co-NP co-NP NP (d) P P = NP = co-NP (a) NP = co-NP (b) P NP ∩ co-NP Figure 34.3 Four possibilities for relationships among complexity classes.

Most researchers regard this possibility as the most likely. consisting of problems for which a solution can be veriûed quickly. You may have learned from experience that it is often more difûcult to solve a problem from scratch than to verify a clearly presented solution, especially when working under time constraints. Theoretical computer scientists generally believe that this analogy extends to the classes P and NP, and thus that NP includes languages that do not belong to P. There is more compelling, though not conclusive, evidence that P ¤ NP4the existence of languages that are <NP-complete.= Section 34.3 will study this class. Many other fundamental questions beyond the P ¤ NP question remain unre- solved. Figure 34.3 shows some possible scenarios. Despite much work by many researchers, no one even knows whether the class NP is closed under complement. That is, does L 2 NP imply L 2 NP? We deûne the complexity class co-NP as the set of languages L such that L 2 NP, so that the question of whether NP is closed under complement is also whether NP D co-NP. Since P is closed under complement (Exercise 34.1-6), it follows from Exercise 34.2-9 (P ෂ co-NP) that P ෂ NP \\ co-NP. Once again, however, no one knows whether P D NP \\ co-NP or whether there is some language in .NP \\ co-NP/  P. Thus our understanding of the precise relationship between P and NP is woe- fully incomplete. Nevertheless, even though we might not be able to prove that a particular problem is intractable, if we can prove that it is NP-complete, then we have gained valuable information about it. 1060 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness Exercises 34.2-1 Consider the language GRAPH-ISOMORPHISM D fhG 1 ; G 2 i W G 1 and G 2 are isomorphic graphsg.

Prove that G 3 is hamiltonian. (Hint: Construct a spanning tree for G, and use an inductive argument.) 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility Perhaps the most compelling reason why theoretical computer scientists believe that P ¤ NP comes from the existence of the class of NP-complete problems. This class has the intriguing property that if any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP has a polynomial-time solution, that is, P D NP. Despite decades of study, though, no polynomial-time algorithm has ever been discovered for any NP-complete problem. The language HAM-CYCLE is one NP-complete problem. If there were an algorithm to decide HAM-CYCLE in polynomial time, then every problem in NP could be solved in polynomial time. The NP-complete languages are, in a sense, the <hardest= languages in NP. In fact, if NP  P turns out to be nonempty, we will be able to say with certainty that HAM-CYCLE 2 NP  P. This section starts by showing how to compare the relative <hardness= of lan- guages using a precise notion called <polynomial-time reducibility.= It then for- mally deûnes the NP-complete languages, ûnishing by sketching a proof that one such language, called CIRCUIT-SAT, is NP-complete. Sections 34.4 and 34.5 will use the notion of reducibility to show that many other problems are NP-complete. Reducibility One way that sometimes works for solving a problem is to recast it as a different problem. We call that strategy <reducing= one problem to another. Think of a problem Q as being reducible to another problem Q 0 if any instance of Q can be recast as an instance of Q 0 , and the solution to the instance of Q 0 provides a solution to the instance of Q. For example, the problem of solving linear equations in an indeterminate x reduces to the problem of solving quadratic equations. Given a linear-equation instance ax C b D 0 (with solution x D b=a), you can transform it to the quadratic equation ax 2 C bx C 0 D 0. This quadratic equation has the solutions x D .b ˙ p b 2  4ac/=2a, where c D 0, so that p b 2  4ac D b. The 1062 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness L 2 L 1 {0,1}* {0,1}* f Figure 34.4 A function f that reduces language L 1 to language L 2 . For any input x 2 f0; 1g  , the question of whether x 2 L 1 has the same answer as the question of whether f .x/ 2 L 2 . solutions are then x D .b C b/=2a D 0 and x D .b  b/=2a D b=a, thereby providing a solution to ax C b D 0. Thus, if a problem Q reduces to another problem Q 0 , then Q is, in a sense, <no harder to solve= than Q 0 . Returning to our formal-language framework for decision problems, we say that a language L 1 is polynomial-time reducible to a language L 2 , written L 1 හ P L 2 , if there exists a polynomial-time computable function f W f0; 1g  ! f0; 1g  such that for all x 2 f0; 1g  , x 2 L 1 if and only if f .x/ 2 L 2 : (34.1) We call the function f the reduction function, and a polynomial-time algorithm F that computes f is a reduction algorithm. Figure 34.4 illustrates the idea of a reduction from a language L 1 to another language L 2 . Each language is a subset of f0; 1g  . The reduction function f pro- vides a mapping such that if x 2 L 1 , then f .x/ 2 L 2 . Moreover, if x … L 1 , then f .x/ … L 2 . Thus, the reduction function maps any instance x of the decision problem represented by the language L 1 to an instance f .x/ of the problem rep- resented by L 2 . Providing an answer to whether f .x/ 2 L 2 directly provides the answer to whether x 2 L 1 . If, in addition, f can be computed in polynomial time, it is a polynomial-time reduction function. Polynomial-time reductions give us a powerful tool for proving that various lan- guages belong to P. Lemma 34.3 If L 1 ; L 2 ෂ f0; 1g  are languages such that L 1 හ P L 2 , then L 2 2 P implies L 1 2 P. 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility 1063 x F f .x/ A 1 A 2 yes, f .x/ 2 L 2 no, f .x/ 62 L 2 yes, x 2 L 1 no, x 62 L 1 Figure 34.5 The proof of Lemma 34.3. The algorithm F is a reduction algorithm that computes the reduction function f from L 1 to L 2 in polynomial time, and A 2 is a polynomial-time algorithm that decides L 2 . Algorithm A 1 decides whether x 2 L 1 by using F to transform any input x into f .x/ and then using A 2 to decide whether f .x/ 2 L 2 . Proof Let A 2 be a polynomial-time algorithm that decides L 2 , and let F be a polynomial-time reduction algorithm that computes the reduction function f . We show how to construct a polynomial-time algorithm A 1 that decides L 1 . Figure 34.5 illustrates how we construct A 1 . For a given input x 2 f0; 1g  , algorithm A 1 uses F to transform x into f .x/, and then it uses A 2 to test whether f .x/ 2 L 2 . Algorithm A 1 takes the output from algorithm A 2 and produces that answer as its own output. The correctness of A 1 follows from condition (34.1). The algorithm runs in poly- nomial time, since both F and A 2 run in polynomial time (see Exercise 34.1-5). NP-completeness Polynomial-time reductions allow us to formally show that one problem is at least as hard as another, to within a polynomial-time factor. That is, if L 1 හ P L 2 , then L 1 is not more than a polynomial factor harder than L 2 , which is why the <less than or equal to= notation for reduction is mnemonic. We can now deûne the set of NP-complete languages, which are the hardest problems in NP. A language L ෂ f0; 1g  is NP-complete if 1. L 2 NP, and 2. L 0 හ P L for every L 0 2 NP. If a language L satisûes property 2, but not necessarily property 1, we say that L is NP-hard. We also deûne NPC to be the class of NP-complete languages. As the following theorem shows, NP-completeness is at the crux of deciding whether P is in fact equal to NP. Theorem 34.4 If any NP-complete problem is polynomial-time solvable, then P D NP. Equiva- lently, if any problem in NP is not polynomial-time solvable, then no NP-complete problem is polynomial-time solvable. 1064 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness NPC P NP Figure 34.6 How most theoretical computer scientists view the relationships among P, NP, and NPC. Both P and NPC are wholly contained within NP, and P \\ NPC D ;. Proof Suppose that L 2 P and also that L 2 NPC. For any L 0 2 NP, we have L 0 හ P L by property 2 of the deûnition of NP-completeness. Thus, by Lemma 34.3, we also have that L 0 2 P, which proves the ûrst statement of the theorem. To prove the second statement, consider the contrapositive of the ûrst statement: if P ¤ NP, then there does not exist an NP-complete problem that is polynomial- time solvable. But P ¤ NP means that there is some problem in NP that is not polynomial-time solvable, and hence the second statement is the contrapositive of the ûrst statement. It is for this reason that research into the P ¤ NP question centers around the NP-complete problems. Most theoretical computer scientists believe that P ¤ NP, which leads to the relationships among P, NP, and NPC shown in Figure 34.6. For all we know, however, someone may yet come up with a polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-complete problem, thus proving that P D NP. Nevertheless, since no polynomial-time algorithm for any NP-complete problem has yet been discovered, a proof that a problem is NP-complete provides excellent evidence that it is intractable. Circuit satisﬁability We have deûned the notion of an NP-complete problem, but up to this point, we have not actually proved that any problem is NP-complete. Once we prove that at least one problem is NP-complete, polynomial-time reducibility becomes a tool to prove other problems to be NP-complete. Thus, we now focus on demonstrating the existence of an NP-complete problem: the circuit-satisûability problem. Unfortunately, the formal proof that the circuit-satisûability problem is NP- complete requires technical detail beyond the scope of this text. Instead, we’ll informally describe a proof that relies on a basic understanding of boolean combi- national circuits. 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility 1065 x z x z 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 (b) (c) x z 0 1 1 0 (a) x x x y y :x x ^ y x _ y Figure 34.7 Three basic logic gates, with binary inputs and outputs. Under each gate is the truth table that describes the gate’s operation. (a) The NOT gate. (b) The AND gate. (c) The OR gate. Boolean combinational circuits are built from boolean combinational elements that are interconnected by wires. A boolean combinational element is any circuit element that has a constant number of boolean inputs and outputs and that performs a well-deûned function. Boolean values are drawn from the set f0; 1g, where 0 represents FALSE and 1 represents TRUE. The boolean combinational elements appearing in the circuit-satisûability prob- lem compute simple boolean functions, and they are known as logic gates. Fig- ure 34.7 shows the three basic logic gates used in the circuit-satisûability problem: the NOT gate (or inverter), the AND gate, and the OR gate. The NOT gate takes a single binary input x , whose value is either 0 or 1, and produces a binary output ´ whose value is opposite that of the input value. Each of the other two gates takes two binary inputs x and y and produces a single binary output ´. The operation of each gate, or of any boolean combinational element, is deûned by a truth table, shown under each gate in Figure 34.7. A truth table gives the outputs of the combinational element for each possible setting of the inputs. For example, the truth table for the OR gate says that when the inputs are x D 0 and y D 1, the output value is ´ D 1. The symbol : denotes the NOT function, ^ denotes the AND function, and _ denotes the OR function. Thus, for example, 0 _ 1 D 1. AND and OR gates are not limited to just two inputs. An AND gate’s output is 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and its output is 0 otherwise. An OR gate’s output is 1 if any of its inputs are 1, and its output is 0 otherwise. A boolean combinational circuit consists of one or more boolean combinational elements interconnected by wires. A wire can connect the output of one element to the input of another, so that the output value of the ûrst element becomes an input value of the second. Figure 34.8 shows two similar boolean combinational circuits, differing in only one gate. Part (a) of the ûgure also shows the values on 1066 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness x 3 x 2 x 1 (a) 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 x 3 x 2 x 1 (b) Figure 34.8 Two instances of the circuit-satisûability problem.

(b) No assignment to the inputs of this circuit can cause the output of the circuit to be 1. The circuit is therefore unsatisûable. the individual wires, given the input hx 1 D 1; x 2 D 1; x 3 D 0i. Although a single wire may have no more than one combinational-element output connected to it, it can feed several element inputs. The number of element inputs fed by a wire is called the fan-out of the wire. If no element output is connected to a wire, the wire is a circuit input, accepting input values from an external source. If no element input is connected to a wire, the wire is a circuit output, providing the results of the circuit’s computation to the outside world. (An internal wire can also fan out to a circuit output.) For the purpose of deûning the circuit-satisûability problem, we limit the number of circuit outputs to 1, though in actual hardware design, a boolean combinational circuit may have multiple outputs. Boolean combinational circuits contain no cycles. In other words, for a given combinational circuit, imagine a directed graph G D .V; E/ with one vertex for each combinational element and with k directed edges for each wire whose fan-out is k, where the graph contains a directed edge .u; v/ if a wire connects the output of element u to an input of element v. Then G must be acyclic. A truth assignment for a boolean combinational circuit is a set of boolean input values. We say that a 1-output boolean combinational circuit is satisﬁable if it has a satisfying assignment: a truth assignment that causes the output of the circuit to be 1. For example, the circuit in Figure 34.8(a) has the satisfying assignment hx 1 D 1; x 2 D 1; x 3 D 0i, and so it is satisûable. As Exercise 34.3-1 asks you to show, no assignment of values to x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 causes the circuit in Figure 34.8(b) to produce a 1 output. Since it always produces 0, it is unsatisûable. The circuit-satisﬁability problem is, <Given a boolean combinational circuit composed of AND, OR, and NOT gates, is it satisûable?= In order to pose this 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility 1067 question formally, however, we must agree on a standard encoding for circuits. The size of a boolean combinational circuit is the number of boolean combinational elements plus the number of wires in the circuit. We could devise a graph-like en- coding that maps any given circuit C into a binary string hC i whose length is polynomial in the size of the circuit itself. As a formal language, we can therefore deûne CIRCUIT-SAT D fhC i W C is a satisûable boolean combinational circuitg : The circuit-satisûability problem arises in the area of computer-aided hardware optimization. If a subcircuit always produces 0, that subcircuit is unnecessary: the designer can replace it by a simpler subcircuit that omits all logic gates and provides the constant 0 value as its output. You can see the value in having a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. Given a circuit C , you can determine whether it is satisûable by simply check- ing all possible assignments to the inputs. Unfortunately, if the circuit has k in- puts, then you would have to check up to 2 k possible assignments. When the size of C is polynomial in k, checking all possible assignments to the inputs takes �.2 k / time, which is superpolynomial in the size of the circuit. 10 In fact, as we have claimed, there is strong evidence that no polynomial-time algorithm exists that solves the circuit-satisûability problem because circuit satisûability is NP-complete. We break the proof of this fact into two parts, based on the two parts of the deûnition of NP-completeness. Lemma 34.5 The circuit-satisûability problem belongs to the class NP. Proof We provide a two-input, polynomial-time algorithm A that can verify CIRCUIT-SAT. One of the inputs to A is (a standard encoding of) a boolean com- binational circuit C . The other input is a certiûcate corresponding to an assignment of a boolean value to each of the wires in C . (See Exercise 34.3-4 for a smaller certiûcate.) The algorithm A works as follows. For each logic gate in the circuit, it checks that the value provided by the certiûcate on the output wire is correctly computed as a function of the values on the input wires. Then, if the output of the entire circuit is 1, algorithm A outputs 1, since the values assigned to the inputs of C provide a satisfying assignment. Otherwise, A outputs 0. 10 On the other hand, if the size of the circuit C is ‚.2 k /, then an algorithm whose running time is O.2 k / has a running time that is polynomial in the circuit size. Even if P ¤ NP, this situa- tion would not contradict the NP-completeness of the problem. The existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case does not imply that there is a polynomial-time algorithm for all cases. 1068 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness Whenever a satisûable circuit C is input to algorithm A, there exists a certiûcate whose length is polynomial in the size of C and that causes A to output a 1. When- ever an unsatisûable circuit is input, no certiûcate can fool A into believing that the circuit is satisûable. Algorithm A runs in polynomial time, and with a good imple- mentation, linear time sufûces. Thus, CIRCUIT-SAT is veriûable in polynomial time, and CIRCUIT-SAT 2 NP. The second part of proving that CIRCUIT-SAT is NP-complete is to show that the language is NP-hard: that every language in NP is polynomial-time reducible to CIRCUIT-SAT. The actual proof of this fact is full of technical intricacies, and so instead we’ll sketch the proof based on some understanding of the workings of computer hardware. A computer program is stored in the computer’s memory as a sequence of in- structions. A typical instruction encodes an operation to be performed, addresses of operands in memory, and an address where the result is to be stored. A special memory location, called the program counter, keeps track of which instruction is to be executed next. The program counter automatically increments when each instruction is fetched, thereby causing the computer to execute instructions sequen- tially. Certain instructions can cause a value to be written to the program counter, however, which alters the normal sequential execution and allows the computer to loop and perform conditional branches. At any point while a program executes, the computer’s memory holds the en- tire state of the computation. (Consider the memory to include the program itself, the program counter, working storage, and any of the various bits of state that a computer maintains for bookkeeping.) We call any particular state of computer memory a conﬁguration. When an instruction executes, it transforms the conûgu- ration. Think of an instruction as mapping one conûguration to another. The com- puter hardware that accomplishes this mapping can be implemented as a boolean combinational circuit, which we denote by M in the proof of the following lemma. Lemma 34.6 The circuit-satisûability problem is NP-hard. Proof Let L be any language in NP. We’ll describe a polynomial-time algo- rithm F computing a reduction function f that maps every binary string x to a circuit C D f .x/ such that x 2 L if and only if C 2 CIRCUIT-SAT. Since L 2 NP, there must exist an algorithm A that veriûes L in polynomial time. The algorithm F that we construct uses the two-input algorithm A to compute the reduction function f . Let T .n/ denote the worst-case running time of algorithm A on length-n input strings, and let k  1 be a constant such that T .n/ D O.n k / and the length of the 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility 1069 M A PC y working storage A PC auxiliary machine state x y working storage M A PC y working storage M A PC y … working storage 0/1 output M c 0 c 1 c 2 c T(n) auxiliary machine state x auxiliary machine state x auxiliary machine state x Figure 34.9 The sequence of conûgurations produced by an algorithm A running on an input x and certiûcate y. Each conûguration represents the state of the computer for one step of the computation and, besides A, x, and y, includes the program counter (PC), auxiliary machine state, and working storage. Except for the certiûcate y, the initial conûguration c 0 is constant. A boolean combinational circuit M maps each conûguration to the next conûguration. The output is a distinguished bit in the working storage. certiûcate is O.n k /. (The running time of A is actually a polynomial in the total input size, which includes both an input string and a certiûcate, but since the length of the certiûcate is polynomial in the length n of the input string, the running time is polynomial in n.) The basic idea of the proof is to represent the computation of A as a sequence of conûgurations. As Figure 34.9 illustrates, consider each conûguration as com- 1070 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness prising a few parts: the program for A, the program counter and auxiliary machine state, the input x , the certiûcate y , and working storage. The combinational cir- cuit M , which implements the computer hardware, maps each conûguration c i to the next conûguration c i C1 , starting from the initial conûguration c 0 . Algorithm A writes its output40 or 14to some designated location by the time it ûnishes exe- cuting. After A halts, the output value never changes. Thus, if the algorithm runs for at most T .n/ steps, the output appears as one of the bits in c T .n/ . The reduction algorithm F constructs a single combinational circuit that com- putes all conûgurations produced by a given initial conûguration. The idea is to paste together T .n/ copies of the circuit M . The output of the i th circuit, which produces conûguration c i , feeds directly into the input of the .i C1/st circuit. Thus, the conûgurations, rather than being stored in the computer’s memory, simply re- side as values on the wires connecting copies of M . Recall what the polynomial-time reduction algorithm F must do. Given an in- put x , it must compute a circuit C D f .x/ that is satisûable if and only if there exists a certiûcate y such that A.x; y/ D 1. When F obtains an input x , it ûrst computes n D jx j and constructs a combinational circuit C 0 consisting of T .n/ copies of M . The input to C 0 is an initial conûguration corresponding to a compu- tation on A.x; y/, and the output is the conûguration c T .n/ . Algorithm F modiûes circuit C 0 slightly to construct the circuit C D f .x/. First, it wires the inputs to C 0 corresponding to the program for A, the initial pro- gram counter, the input x , and the initial state of memory directly to these known values. Thus, the only remaining inputs to the circuit correspond to the certiû- cate y . Second, it ignores all outputs from C 0 , except for the one bit of c T .n/ corresponding to the output of A. This circuit C , so constructed, computes C.y/ D A.x; y/ for any input y of length O.n k /. The reduction algorithm F , when provided an input string x , computes such a circuit C and outputs it. We need to prove two properties. First, we must show that F correctly computes a reduction function f . That is, we must show that C is satisûable if and only if there exists a certiûcate y such that A.x; y/ D 1. Second, we must show that F runs in polynomial time. To show that F correctly computes a reduction function, suppose that there ex- ists a certiûcate y of length O.n k / such that A.x; y/ D 1. Then, upon applying the bits of y to the inputs of C , the output of C is C.y/ D A.x; y/ D 1. Thus, if a certiûcate exists, then C is satisûable. For the other direction, suppose that C is satisûable. Hence, there exists an input y to C such that C.y/ D 1, from which we conclude that A.x; y/ D 1. Thus, F correctly computes a reduction function. To complete the proof sketch, we need to show that F runs in time polynomial in n D jx j. First, the number of bits required to represent a conûguration is poly- nomial in n. Why? The program for A itself has constant size, independent of the length of its input x . The length of the input x is n, and the length of the certiû- 34.3 NP-completeness and reducibility 1071 cate y is O.n k /. Since the algorithm runs for at most O.n k / steps, the amount of working storage required by A is polynomial in n as well. (We implicitly assume that this memory is contiguous. Exercise 34.3-5 asks you to extend the argument to the situation in which the locations accessed by A are scattered across a much larger region of memory and the particular pattern of scattering can differ for each input x .) The combinational circuit M implementing the computer hardware has size polynomial in the length of a conûguration, which is O.n k /, and hence, the size of M is polynomial in n. (Most of this circuitry implements the logic of the mem- ory system.) The circuit C consists of O.n k / copies of M , and hence it has size polynomial in n. The reduction algorithm F can construct C from x in polynomial time, since each step of the construction takes polynomial time. The language CIRCUIT-SAT is therefore at least as hard as any language in NP, and since it belongs to NP, it is NP-complete. Theorem 34.7 The circuit-satisûability problem is NP-complete. Proof Immediate from Lemmas 34.5 and 34.6 and from the deûnition of NP- completeness. Exercises 34.3-1 Verify that the circuit in Figure 34.8(b) is unsatisûable. 34.3-2 Show that the හ P relation is a transitive relation on languages. That is, show that if L 1 හ P L 2 and L 2 හ P L 3 , then L 1 හ P L 3 . 34.3-3 Prove that L හ P L if and only if L හ P L. 34.3-4 Show that an alternative proof of Lemma 34.5 can use a satisfying assignment as a certiûcate. Which certiûcate makes for an easier proof? 34.3-5 The proof of Lemma 34.6 assumes that the working storage for algorithm A oc- cupies a contiguous region of polynomial size. Where does the proof exploit this assumption? Argue that this assumption does not involve any loss of generality. 1072 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 34.3-6 A language L is complete for a language class C with respect to polynomial-time reductions if L 2 C and L 0 හ P L for all L 0 2 C . Show that ; and f0; 1g  are the only languages in P that are not complete for P with respect to polynomial-time reductions. 34.3-7 Show that, with respect to polynomial-time reductions (see Exercise 34.3-6), L is complete for NP if and only if L is complete for co-NP. 34.3-8 The reduction algorithm F in the proof of Lemma 34.6 constructs the circuit C D f .x/ based on knowledge of x , A, and k. Professor Sartre observes that the string x is input to F , but only the existence of A, k, and the constant factor implicit in the O.n k / running time is known to F (since the language L belongs to NP), not their actual values. Thus, the professor concludes that F cannot possi- bly construct the circuit C and that the language CIRCUIT-SAT is not necessarily NP-hard. Explain the üaw in the professor’s reasoning. 34.4 NP-completeness proofs The proof that the circuit-satisûability problem is NP-complete showed directly that L හ P CIRCUIT-SAT for every language L 2 NP. This section shows how to prove that languages are NP-complete without directly reducing every language in NP to the given language. We’ll explore examples of this methodology by prov- ing that various formula-satisûability problems are NP-complete. Section 34.5 pro- vides many more examples. The following lemma provides a foundation for showing that a given language is NP-complete. Lemma 34.8 If L is a language such that L 0 හ P L for some L 0 2 NPC, then L is NP-hard. If, in addition, we have L 2 NP, then L 2 NPC. Proof Since L 0 is NP-complete, for all L 00 2 NP, we have L 00 හ P L 0 . By sup- position, we have L 0 හ P L, and thus by transitivity (Exercise 34.3-2), we have L 00 හ P L, which shows that L is NP-hard. If L 2 NP, we also have L 2 NPC. 34.4 NP-completeness proofs 1073 In other words, by reducing a known NP-complete language L 0 to L, we implic- itly reduce every language in NP to L. Thus, Lemma 34.8 provides a method for proving that a language L is NP-complete: 1. Prove L 2 NP. 2. Prove that L is NP-hard: a. Select a known NP-complete language L 0 . b. Describe an algorithm that computes a function f mapping every instance x 2 f0; 1g  of L 0 to an instance f .x/ of L. c. Prove that the function f satisûes x 2 L 0 if and only if f .x/ 2 L for all x 2 f0; 1g  . d. Prove that the algorithm computing f runs in polynomial time. This methodology of reducing from a single known NP-complete language is far simpler than the more complicated process of showing directly how to reduce from every language in NP. Proving CIRCUIT-SAT 2 NPC furnishes a starting point. Knowing that the circuit-satisûability problem is NP-complete makes it much eas- ier to prove that other problems are NP-complete. Moreover, as the catalog of known NP-complete problems grows, so will the choices for languages from which to reduce. Formula satisﬁability To illustrate the reduction methodology, let’s see an NP-completeness proof for the problem of determining whether a boolean formula, not a circuit, is satisûable. This problem has the historical honor of being the ûrst problem ever shown to be NP-complete. We formulate the (formula) satisﬁability problem in terms of the language SAT as follows. An instance of SAT is a boolean formula � composed of 1. n boolean variables: x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n ; 2. m boolean connectives: any boolean function with one or two inputs and one output, such as ^ (AND), _ (OR), : (NOT), ! (implication), $ (if and only if); and 3. parentheses. (Without loss of generality, assume that there are no redundant parentheses, i.e., a formula contains at most one pair of parentheses per boolean connective.) We can encode a boolean formula � in a length that is polynomial in n C m. As in boolean combinational circuits, a truth assignment for a boolean formula � 1074 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness is a set of values for the variables of �, and a satisfying assignment is a truth assignment that causes it to evaluate to 1. A formula with a satisfying assignment is a satisﬁable formula. The satisûability problem asks whether a given boolean formula is satisûable, which we can express in formal-language terms as SAT D fh�i W � is a satisûable boolean formulag : As an example, the formula D ..x 1 ! x 2 / _ :..:x 1 $ x 3 / _ x 4 // ^ :x 2 has the satisfying assignment hx 1 D 0; x 2 D 0; x 3 D 1; x 4 D 1i, since � D ..0 ! 0/ _ :..:0 $ 1/ _ 1// ^ :0 (34.2) D .1 _ :.1 _ 1// ^ 1 D .1 _ 0/ ^ 1 D 1 ; and thus this formula � belongs to SAT. The naive algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary boolean formula is satis- ûable does not run in polynomial time. A formula with n variables has 2 n possible assignments. If the length of h�i is polynomial in n, then checking every assign- ment requires �.2 n / time, which is superpolynomial in the length of h�i. As the following theorem shows, a polynomial-time algorithm is unlikely to exist. Theorem 34.9 Satisûability of boolean formulas is NP-complete. Proof We start by arguing that SAT 2 NP. Then we prove that SAT is NP-hard by showing that CIRCUIT-SAT හ P SAT, which by Lemma 34.8 will prove the theorem. To show that SAT belongs to NP, we show that a certiûcate consisting of a satisfying assignment for an input formula � can be veriûed in polynomial time. The verifying algorithm simply replaces each variable in the formula with its cor- responding value and then evaluates the expression, much as we did in equa- tion (34.2) above. This task can be done in polynomial time. If the expression evaluates to 1, then the algorithm has veriûed that the formula is satisûable. Thus, SAT belongs to NP. To prove that SAT is NP-hard, we show that CIRCUIT-SAT හ P SAT. In other words, we need to show how to reduce any instance of circuit satisûability to an instance of formula satisûability in polynomial time. We can use induction to express any boolean combinational circuit as a boolean formula. We simply look at the gate that produces the circuit output and inductively express each of the 34.4 NP-completeness proofs 1075 x 6 x 3 x 4 x 7 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 5 x 2 x 1 Figure 34.10 Reducing circuit satisûability to formula satisûability. The formula produced by the reduction algorithm has a variable for each wire in the circuit and a clause for each logic gate. gate’s inputs as formulas. We then obtain the formula for the circuit by writing an expression that applies the gate’s function to its inputs’ formulas. Unfortunately, this straightforward method does not amount to a polynomial- time reduction. As Exercise 34.4-1 asks you to show, shared subformulas4which arise from gates whose output wires have fan-out of 2 or more4can cause the size of the generated formula to grow exponentially. Thus, the reduction algorithm must be somewhat more clever. Figure 34.10 illustrates how to overcome this problem, using as an example the circuit from Figure 34.8(a). For each wire x i in the circuit C , the formula � has a variable x i . To express how each gate operates, construct a small formula involving the variables of its incident wires. The formula has the form of an <if and only if= ($), with the variable for the gate’s output on the left and on the right a logical ex- pression encapsulating the gate’s function on its inputs. For example, the operation of the output AND gate (the rightmost gate in the ûgure) is x 10 $ .x 7 ^ x 8 ^ x 9 /. We call each of these small formulas a clause. The formula � produced by the reduction algorithm is the AND of the circuit- output variable with the conjunction of clauses describing the operation of each gate. For the circuit in the ûgure, the formula is � D x 10 ^ .x 4 $ :x 3 / ^ .x 5 $ .x 1 _ x 2 // ^ .x 6 $ :x 4 / ^ .x 7 $ .x 1 ^ x 2 ^ x 4 // ^ .x 8 $ .x 5 _ x 6 // ^ .x 9 $ .x 6 _ x 7 // ^ .x 10 $ .x 7 ^ x 8 ^ x 9 // : 1076 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness Given a circuit C , it is straightforward to produce such a formula � in polynomial time. Why is the circuit C satisûable exactly when the formula � is satisûable? If C has a satisfying assignment, then each wire of the circuit has a well-deûned value, and the output of the circuit is 1. Therefore, when wire values are as- signed to variables in �, each clause of � evaluates to 1, and thus the conjunction of all evaluates to 1. Conversely, if some assignment causes � to evaluate to 1, the circuit C is satisûable by an analogous argument. Thus, we have shown that CIRCUIT-SAT හ P SAT, which completes the proof. 3-CNF satisﬁability Reducing from formula satisûability gives us an avenue to prove many problems NP-complete. The reduction algorithm must handle any input formula, though, and this requirement can lead to a huge number of cases to consider. Instead, it is usually simpler to reduce from a restricted language of boolean formulas. Of course, the restricted language must not be polynomial-time solvable. One convenient language is 3-CNF satisûability, or 3-CNF-SAT. In order to deûne 3-CNF satisûability, we ûrst need to deûne a few terms. A literal in a boolean formula is an occurrence of a variable (such as x 1 ) or its nega- tion (:x 1 ). A clause is the OR of one or more literals, such as x 1 _ :x 2 _ :x 3 . A boolean formula is in conjunctive normal form, or CNF, if it is expressed as an AND of clauses, and it’s in 3-conjunctive normal form, or 3-CNF, if each clause contains exactly three distinct literals. For example, the boolean formula .x 1 _ :x 1 _ :x 2 / ^ .x 3 _ x 2 _ x 4 / ^ .:x 1 _ :x 3 _ :x 4 / is in 3-CNF. The ûrst of its three clauses is .x 1 _ :x 1 _ :x 2 /, which contains the three literals x 1 , :x 1 , and :x 2 . The language 3-CNF-SAT consists of encodings of boolean formulas in 3-CNF that are satisûable. The following theorem shows that a polynomial-time algorithm that can determine the satisûability of boolean formulas is unlikely to exist, even when they are expressed in this simple normal form. Theorem 34.10 Satisûability of boolean formulas in 3-conjunctive normal form is NP-complete. Proof The argument from the proof of Theorem 34.9 to show that SAT 2 NP ap- plies equally well here to show that 3-CNF-SAT 2 NP. By Lemma 34.8, therefore, we need only show that SAT හ P 3-CNF-SAT. 34.4 NP-completeness proofs 1077 :x 1 x 1 :x 2 x 2 x 3 x 4 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5 y 6 ^ $ _ _ : ! Figure 34.11 The tree corresponding to the formula � D ..x 1 ! x 2 /_:..:x 1 $ x 3 /_x 4 //^:x 2 : We break the reduction algorithm into three basic steps. Each step progressively transforms the input formula � closer to the desired 3-conjunctive normal form. The ûrst step is similar to the one used to prove CIRCUIT-SAT හ P SAT in Theorem 34.9. First, construct a binary <parse= tree for the input formula �, with literals as leaves and connectives as internal nodes. Figure 34.11 shows such a parse tree for the formula D ..x 1 ! x 2 / _ :..:x 1 $ x 3 / _ x 4 // ^ :x 2 : (34.3) If the input formula contains a clause such as the OR of several literals, use as- sociativity to parenthesize the expression fully so that every internal node in the resulting tree has just one or two children. The binary parse tree is like a circuit for computing the function. Mimicking the reduction in the proof of Theorem 34.9, introduce a variable y i for the output of each internal node. Then rewrite the original formula � as the AND of the variable at the root of the parse tree and a conjunction of clauses describing the operation of each node. For the formula (34.3), the resulting expres- sion is 0 D y 1 ^ .y 1 $ .y 2 ^ :x 2 // ^ .y 2 $ .y 3 _ y 4 // ^ .y 3 $ .x 1 ! x 2 // ^ .y 4 $ :y 5 / ^ .y 5 $ .y 6 _ x 4 // ^ .y 6 $ .:x 1 $ x 3 // : 1078 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness y 1 y 2 x 2 .y 1 $ .y 2 ^ :x 2 // 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 Figure 34.12 The truth table for the clause .y 1 $ .y 2 ^ :x 2 //. The formula � 0 thus obtained is a conjunction of clauses � 0 i , each of which has at most three literals. These clauses are not yet ORs of three literals. The second step of the reduction converts each clause � 0 i into conjunctive nor- mal form. Construct a truth table for � 0 i by evaluating all possible assignments to its variables. Each row of the truth table consists of a possible assignment of the variables of the clause, together with the value of the clause under that assignment. Using the truth-table entries that evaluate to 0, build a formula in disjunctive nor- mal form (or DNF)4an OR of ANDs4that is equivalent to :� 0 i . Then negate this formula and convert it into a CNF formula � 00 i by using DeMorgan’s laws for propositional logic, .a ^ b/ D :a _ :b ; :.a _ b/ D :a ^ :b ; to complement all literals, change ORs into ANDs, and change ANDs into ORs. In our example, the clause � 0 1 D .y 1 $ .y 2 ^ :x 2 // converts into CNF as fol- lows. The truth table for � 0 1 appears in Figure 34.12. The DNF formula equivalent to :� 0 1 is .y 1 ^ y 2 ^ x 2 / _ .y 1 ^ :y 2 ^ x 2 / _ .y 1 ^ :y 2 ^ :x 2 / _ .:y 1 ^ y 2 ^ :x 2 / : Negating and applying DeMorgan’s laws yields the CNF formula � 00 1 D .:y 1 _ :y 2 _ :x 2 / ^ .:y 1 _ y 2 _ :x 2 / ^ .:y 1 _ y 2 _ x 2 / ^ .y 1 _ :y 2 _ x 2 / ; which is equivalent to the original clause � 0 1 . At this point, each clause � 0 i of the formula � 0 has been converted into a CNF formula � 00 i , and thus � 0 is equivalent to the CNF formula � 00 consisting of the conjunction of the � 00 i . Moreover, each clause of � 00 has at most three literals. 34.4 NP-completeness proofs 1079 The third and ûnal step of the reduction further transforms the formula so that each clause has exactly three distinct literals. From the clauses of the CNF for- mula � 00 , construct the ûnal 3-CNF formula � 000 . This formula also uses two aux- iliary variables, p and q. For each clause C i of � 00 , include the following clauses in � 000 :  If C i contains three distinct literals, then simply include C i as a clause of � 000 .  If C i contains exactly two distinct literals, that is, if C i D .l 1 _ l 2 /, where l 1 and l 2 are literals, then include .l 1 _ l 2 _ p/ ^ .l 1 _ l 2 _ :p/ as clauses of � 000 . The literals p and :p merely fulûll the syntactic requirement that each clause of � 000 contain exactly three distinct literals. Whether p D 0 or p D 1, one of the clauses is equivalent to l 1 _ l 2 , and the other evaluates to 1, which is the identity for AND.  If C i contains just one distinct literal l , then include .l _ p _ q/ ^ .l _ p _ :q/ ^ .l _ :p _ q/ ^ .l _ :p _ :q/ as clauses of � 000 . Regardless of the values of p and q, one of the four clauses is equivalent to l , and the other three evaluate to 1. We can see that the 3-CNF formula � 000 is satisûable if and only if � is satisûable by inspecting each of the three steps. Like the reduction from CIRCUIT-SAT to SAT, the construction of � 0 from � in the ûrst step preserves satisûability. The sec- ond step produces a CNF formula � 00 that is algebraically equivalent to � 0 . Then the third step produces a 3-CNF formula � 000 that is effectively equivalent to � 00 , since any assignment to the variables p and q produces a formula that is algebraically equivalent to � 00 . We must also show that the reduction can be computed in polynomial time. Con- structing � 0 from � introduces at most one variable and one clause per connective in �. Constructing � 00 from � 0 can introduce at most eight clauses into � 00 for each clause from � 0 , since each clause of � 0 contains at most three variables, and the truth table for each clause has at most 2 3 D 8 rows. The construction of � 000 from � 00 introduces at most four clauses into � 000 for each clause of � 00 . Thus the size of the resulting formula � 000 is polynomial in the length of the original formula. Each of the constructions can be accomplished in polynomial time. Exercises 34.4-1 Consider the straightforward (nonpolynomial-time) reduction in the proof of The- orem 34.9. Describe a circuit of size n that, when converted to a formula by this method, yields a formula whose size is exponential in n. 1080 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 34.4-2 Show the 3-CNF formula that results upon using the method of Theorem 34.10 on the formula (34.3). 34.4-3 Professor Jagger proposes to show that SAT හ P 3-CNF-SAT by using only the truth-table technique in the proof of Theorem 34.10, and not the other steps. That is, the professor proposes to take the boolean formula �, form a truth table for its variables, derive from the truth table a formula in 3-DNF that is equivalent to :�, and then negate and apply DeMorgan’s laws to produce a 3-CNF formula equivalent to �. Show that this strategy does not yield a polynomial-time reduction. 34.4-4 Show that the problem of determining whether a boolean formula is a tautology is complete for co-NP. (Hint: See Exercise 34.3-7.) 34.4-5 Show that the problem of determining the satisûability of boolean formulas in dis- junctive normal form is polynomial-time solvable. 34.4-6 Someone gives you a polynomial-time algorithm to decide formula satisûability. Describe how to use this algorithm to ûnd satisfying assignments in polynomial time. 34.4-7 Let 2-CNF-SAT be the set of satisûable boolean formulas in CNF with exactly two literals per clause. Show that 2-CNF-SAT 2 P. Make your algorithm as efûcient as possible. (Hint: Observe that x _ y is equivalent to :x ! y . Reduce 2-CNF-SAT to an efûciently solvable problem on a directed graph.) 34.5 NP-complete problems NP-complete problems arise in diverse domains: boolean logic, graphs, arith- metic, network design, sets and partitions, storage and retrieval, sequencing and scheduling, mathematical programming, algebra and number theory, games and puzzles, automata and language theory, program optimization, biology, chemistry, physics, and more. This section uses the reduction methodology to provide NP- completeness proofs for a variety of problems drawn from graph theory and set partitioning. 34.5 NP-complete problems 1081 CIRCUIT-SAT SAT 3-CNF-SAT CLIQUE VERTEX-COVER SUBSET-SUM HAM-CYCLE TSP Figure 34.13 The structure of NP-completeness proofs in Sections 34.4 and 34.5. All proofs ulti- mately follow by reduction from the NP-completeness of CIRCUIT-SAT. Figure 34.13 outlines the structure of the NP-completeness proofs in this section and Section 34.4. We prove each language in the ûgure to be NP-complete by reduction from the language that points to it. At the root is CIRCUIT-SAT, which we proved NP-complete in Theorem 34.7. This section concludes with a recap of reduction strategies. 34.5.1 The clique problem A clique in an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a subset V 0 ෂ V of vertices, each pair of which is connected by an edge in E. In other words, a clique is a complete subgraph of G. The size of a clique is the number of vertices it contains. The clique problem is the optimization problem of ûnding a clique of maximum size in a graph. The corresponding decision problem asks simply whether a clique of a given size k exists in the graph. The formal deûnition is CLIQUE D fhG; ki W G is a graph containing a clique of size kg : A naive algorithm for determining whether a graph G D .V; E/ with jV j ver- tices contains a clique of size k lists all k-subsets of V and checks each one to see whether it forms a clique. The running time of this algorithm is �.k 2 ã jV j k ä /, which is polynomial if k is a constant. In general, however, k could be near jV j =2, in which case the algorithm runs in superpolynomial time. Indeed, an efûcient algorithm for the clique problem is unlikely to exist. 1082 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness Theorem 34.11 The clique problem is NP-complete. Proof First, we show that CLIQUE 2 NP. For a given graph G D .V; E/, use the set V 0 ෂ V of vertices in the clique as a certiûcate for G. To check whether V 0 is a clique in polynomial time, check whether, for each pair u; v 2 V 0 , the edge .u; v/ belongs to E. We next prove that 3-CNF-SAT හ P CLIQUE, which shows that the clique prob- lem is NP-hard. You might be surprised that the proof reduces an instance of 3-CNF-SAT to an instance of CLIQUE, since on the surface logical formulas seem to have little to do with graphs. The reduction algorithm begins with an instance of 3-CNF-SA T. Let � D C 1 ^ C 2 ^    ^ C k be a boolean formula in 3-CNF with k clauses. For r D 1; 2; : : : ; k, each clause C r contains exactly three distinct literals: l r 1 , l r 2 , and l r 3 . We will construct a graph G such that � is satisûable if and only if G contains a clique of size k. We construct the undirected graph G D .V; E/ as follows. For each clause C r D .l r 1 _ l r 2 _ l r 3 / in �, place a triple of vertices v r 1 , v r 2 , and v r 3 into V . Add edge .v r i ; v s j / into E if both of the following hold:  v r i and v s j are in different triples, that is, r ¤ s , and  their corresponding literals are consistent, that is, l r i is not the negation of l s j . We can build this graph from � in polynomial time. As an example of this con- struction, if D .x 1 _ :x 2 _ :x 3 / ^ .:x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 / ^ .x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 / ; then G is the graph shown in Figure 34.14. We must show that this transformation of � into G is a reduction. First, suppose that � has a satisfying assignment. Then each clause C r contains at least one literal l r i that is assigned 1, and each such literal corresponds to a vertex v r i . Picking one such <true= literal from each clause yields a set V 0 of k vertices. We claim that V 0 is a clique. For any two vertices v r i ; v s j 2 V 0 , where r ¤ s , both corresponding literals l r i and l s j map to 1 by the given satisfying assignment, and thus the literals cannot be complements. Thus, by the construction of G, the edge .v r i ; v s j / belongs to E. Conversely, suppose that G contains a clique V 0 of size k. No edges in G con- nect vertices in the same triple, and so V 0 contains exactly one vertex per triple. If v r i 2 V 0 , then assign 1 to the corresponding literal l r i . Since G contains no edges between inconsistent literals, no literal and its complement are both assigned 1. Each clause is satisûed, and so � is satisûed. (Any variables that do not correspond to a vertex in the clique may be set arbitrarily.) 34.5 NP-complete problems 1083 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 :x 1 :x 2 :x 3 C 1 D x 1 _ :x 2 _ :x 3 C 2 D :x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 C 3 D x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 Figure 34.14 The graph G derived from the 3-CNF formula � D C 1 ^ C 2 ^ C 3 , where C 1 D .x 1 _ :x 2 _ :x 3 /, C 2 D .:x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 /, and C 3 D .x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 /, in reducing 3-CNF-SAT to CLIQUE. A satisfying assignment of the formula has x 2 D 0, x 3 D 1, and x 1 set to either 0 or 1. This assignment satisûes C 1 with :x 2 , and it satisûes C 2 and C 3 with x 3 , corresponding to the clique with blue vertices. In the example of Figure 34.14, a satisfying assignment of � has x 2 D 0 and x 3 D 1. A corresponding clique of size k D 3 consists of the vertices cor- responding to :x 2 from the ûrst clause, x 3 from the second clause, and x 3 from the third clause. Because the clique contains no vertices corresponding to either x 1 or :x 1 , this satisfying assignment can set x 1 to either 0 or 1. The proof of Theorem 34.11 reduced an arbitrary instance of 3-CNF-SAT to an instance of CLIQUE with a particular structure. You might think that we have shown only that CLIQUE is NP-hard in graphs in which the vertices are restricted to occur in triples and in which there are no edges between vertices in the same triple. Indeed, we have shown that CLIQUE is NP-hard only in this restricted case, but this proof sufûces to show that CLIQUE is NP-hard in general graphs. Why? If there were a polynomial-time algorithm that solves CLIQUE on general graphs, it would also solve CLIQUE on restricted graphs. The opposite approach4reducing instances of 3-CNF-SAT with a special struc- ture to general instances of CLIQUE4does not sufûce, however. Why not? Per- haps the instances of 3-CNF-SAT that we choose to reduce from are <easy,= and so we would not have reduced an NP-hard problem to CLIQUE. Moreover, the reduction uses the instance of 3-CNF-SAT, but not the solution. We would have erred if the polynomial-time reduction had relied on knowing 1084 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness u y x z w (a) u y x z w (b) v v Figure 34.15 Reducing CLIQUE to VERTEX-COVER.

(b) The graph G produced by the reduction algorithm that has vertex cover V  V 0 D fw; ´g, in blue. whether the formula � is satisûable, since we do not know how to decide whether � is satisûable in polynomial time. 34.5.2 The vertex-cover problem A vertex cover of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a subset V 0 ෂ V such that if .u; v/ 2 E, then u 2 V 0 or v 2 V 0 (or both). That is, each vertex <covers= its incident edges, and a vertex cover for G is a set of vertices that covers all the edges in E. The size of a vertex cover is the number of vertices in it. For example, the graph in Figure 34.15(b) has a vertex cover fw; ´g of size 2. The vertex-cover problem is to ûnd a vertex cover of minimum size in a given graph. For this optimization problem, the corresponding decision problem asks whether a graph has a vertex cover of a given size k. As a language, we deûne VERTEX-COVER D fhG; ki W graph G has a vertex cover of size kg : The following theorem shows that this problem is NP-complete. Theorem 34.12 The vertex-cover problem is NP-complete. Proof We ûrst show that VERTEX-COVER 2 NP. Given a graph G D .V; E/ and an integer k, the certiûcate is the vertex cover V 0 ෂ V itself. The veriûcation algorithm afûrms that jV 0 j D k, and then it checks, for each edge .u; v/ 2 E, that u 2 V 0 or v 2 V 0 . It is easy to verify the certiûcate in polynomial time. To prove that the vertex-cover problem is NP-hard, we reduce from the clique problem, showing that CLIQUE හ P VERTEX-COVER. This reduction relies 34.5 NP-complete problems 1085 on the notion of the complement of a graph. Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, we deûne the complement of G as a graph G D .V; E/, where E D f.u; v/ W u; v 2 V; u ¤ v; and .u; v/ … Eg. In other words, G is the graph con- taining exactly those edges that are not in G. Figure 34.15 shows a graph and its complement and illustrates the reduction from CLIQUE to VERTEX-COVER. The reduction algorithm takes as input an instance hG; ki of the clique problem and computes the complement G in polynomial time. The output of the reduction algorithm is the instance h G; jV j  ki of the vertex-cover problem. To complete the proof, we show that this transformation is indeed a reduction: the graph G contains a clique of size k if and only if the graph G has a vertex cover of size jV j  k. Suppose that G contains a clique V 0 ෂ V with jV 0 j D k. We claim that V  V 0 is a vertex cover in G. Let .u; v/ be any edge in E. Then, .u; v/ … E, which implies that at least one of u or v does not belong to V 0 , since every pair of vertices in V 0 is connected by an edge of E. Equivalently, at least one of u or v belongs to V  V 0 , which means that edge .u; v/ is covered by V  V 0 . Since .u; v/ was chosen arbitrarily from E, every edge of E is covered by a vertex in V  V 0 . Hence the set V  V 0 , which has size jV j  k, forms a vertex cover for G. Conversely, suppose that G has a vertex cover V 0 ෂ V , where jV 0 j D jV j  k. Then for all u; v 2 V , if .u; v/ 2 E, then u 2 V 0 or v 2 V 0 or both. The contrapositive of this implication is that for all u; v 2 V , if u … V 0 and v … V 0 , then .u; v/ 2 E. In other words, V V 0 is a clique, and it has size jV jjV 0 j D k. Since VERTEX-COVER is NP-complete, we don’t expect to ûnd a polynomial- time algorithm for ûnding a minimum-size vertex cover. Section 35.1 presents a polynomial-time <approximation algorithm,= however, which produces <approxi- mate= solutions for the vertex-cover problem. The size of a vertex cover produced by the algorithm is at most twice the minimum size of a vertex cover. Thus, you shouldn’t give up hope just because a problem is NP-complete. You might be able to design a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that obtains near-optimal solutions, even though ûnding an optimal solution is NP-complete. Chapter 35 gives several approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems. 34.5.3 The hamiltonian-cycle problem We now return to the hamiltonian-cycle problem deûned in Section 34.2. Theorem 34.13 The hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete. 1086 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness (a) (b) (c) (d) � uv � uv � uv � uv Œu; v; 1� Œu; v; 1� Œu; v; 1� Œu; v; 1� Œu; v; 2� Œu; v; 3� Œu; v; 4� Œu; v; 5� Œu; v; 6� Œu; v; 6� Œu; v; 6� Œu; v; 6� Œv; u; 1� Œv; u; 1� Œv; u; 1� Œv; u; 1� Œv; u; 2� Œv; u; 3� Œv; u; 4� Œv; u; 5� Œv; u; 6� Œv; u; 6� Œv; u; 6� Œv; u; 6� Figure 34.16 The gadget used in reducing the vertex-cover problem to the hamiltonian-cycle prob- lem. An edge .u; v/ of graph G corresponds to gadget � uv in the graph G 0 created in the reduction. (a) The gadget, with individual vertices labeled. (b)–(d) The paths highlighted in blue are the only possible ones through the gadget that include all vertices, assuming that the only connections from the gadget to the remainder of G 0 are through vertices Œu; v; 1�, Œu; v; 6�, Œv; u; 1�, and Œv; u; 6�. Proof We ûrst show that HAM-CYCLE 2 NP. Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, the certiûcate is the sequence of jV j vertices that makes up the hamil- tonian cycle. The veriûcation algorithm checks that this sequence contains each vertex in V exactly once and that with the ûrst vertex repeated at the end, it forms a cycle in G. That is, it checks that there is an edge between each pair of consecu- tive vertices and between the ûrst and last vertices. This certiûcate can be veriûed in polynomial time. We now prove that VERTEX-COVER හ P HAM-CYCLE, which shows that HAM-CYCLE is NP-complete. Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/ and an integer k, we construct an undirected graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / that has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if G has a vertex cover of size k. We assume without loss of generality that G contains no isolated vertices (that is, every vertex in V has at least one incident edge) and that k හ jV j. (If an isolated vertex belongs to a vertex cover of size k, then there also exists a vertex cover of size k  1, and for any graph, the entire set V is always a vertex cover.) Our construction uses a gadget, which is a piece of a graph that enforces certain properties. Figure 34.16(a) shows the gadget we use. For each edge .u; v/ 2 E, the constructed graph G 0 contains one copy of this gadget, which we denote by � uv . We denote each vertex in � uv by Œu; v; i � or Œv; u; i �, where 1 හ i හ 6, so that each gadget � uv contains 12 vertices. Gadget � uv also contains the 14 edges shown in Figure 34.16(a). Along with the internal structure of the gadget, we enforce the properties we want by limiting the connections between the gadget and the remainder of the graph G 0 that we construct. In particular, only vertices Œu; v; 1�, Œu; v; 6�, Œv; u; 1�, and Œv; u; 6� will have edges incident from outside � uv . Any hamiltonian cycle 34.5 NP-complete problems 1087 of G 0 must traverse the edges of � uv in one of the three ways shown in Fig- ures 34.16(b)3(d). If the cycle enters through vertex Œu; v; 1�, it must exit through vertex Œu; v; 6�, and it either visits all 12 of the gadget’s vertices (Figure 34.16(b)) or the six vertices Œu; v; 1� through Œu; v; 6� (Figure 34.16(c)). In the latter case, the cycle will have to reenter the gadget to visit vertices Œv; u; 1� through Œv; u; 6�. Simi- larly, if the cycle enters through vertex Œv; u; 1�, it must exit through vertex Œv; u; 6�, and either it visits all 12 of the gadget’s vertices (Figure 34.16(d)) or it visits the six vertices Œv; u; 1� through Œv; u; 6� and reenters to visit Œu; v; 1� through Œu; v; 6� (Figure 34.16(c)). No other paths through the gadget that visit all 12 vertices are possible. In particular, it is impossible to construct two vertex-disjoint paths, one of which connects Œu; v; 1� to Œv; u; 6� and the other of which connects Œv; u; 1� to Œu; v; 6�, such that the union of the two paths contains all of the gadget’s ver- tices. The only other vertices in V 0 other than those of gadgets are selector vertices s 1 ; s 2 ; : : : ; s k . We’ll use edges incident on selector vertices in G 0 to select the k vertices of the cover in G. In addition to the edges in gadgets, E 0 contains two other types of edges, which Figure 34.17 shows. First, for each vertex u 2 V , edges join pairs of gadgets in order to form a path containing all gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u in G. We arbitrarily order the vertices adjacent to each vertex u 2 V as u .1/ ; u .2/ ; : : : ; u .degree.u// , where degree.u/ is the number of vertices adjacent to u. To create a path in G 0 through all the gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u, E 0 contains the edges f.Œu; u .i / ; 6�; Œu; u .i C1/ ; 1�/ W 1 හ i හ degree.u/  1g. In Figure 34.17, for example, we order the vertices adjacent to w as hx; y; ´i, and so graph G 0 in part (b) of the ûgure includes the edges .Œw; x; 6�; Œw; y; 1�/ and .Œw; y; 6�; Œw; ´; 1�/. The vertices adjacent to x are ordered as hw; y i, so that G 0 includes the edge .Œx; w; 6�; Œx; y; 1�/. For each vertex u 2 V , these edges in G 0 ûll in a path containing all gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u in G. The intuition behind these edges is that if vertex u 2 V belongs to the vertex cover of G, then G 0 contains a path from Œu; u .1/ ; 1� to Œu; u .degree.u// ; 6� that <cov- ers= all gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u. That is, for each of these gadgets, say � u;u .i / , the path either includes all 12 vertices (if u belongs to the ver- tex cover but u .i / does not) or just the six vertices Œu; u .i / ; 1� through Œu; u .i / ; 6� (if both u and u .i / belong to the vertex cover). The ûnal type of edge in E 0 joins the ûrst vertex Œu; u .1/ ; 1� and the last vertex Œu; u .degree.u// ; 6� of each of these paths to each of the selector vertices. That is, E 0 includes the edges .s j ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/ W u 2 V and 1 හ j හ kg [ f.s j ; Œu; u .degree.u// ; 6�/ W u 2 V and 1 හ j හ kg : 1088 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness [w,x,1] [w,x,6] [x,w,1] [x,w,6] (b) [x,y,1] [x,y,6] [y,x,1] [y,x,6] [w,y,1] [w,y,6] [y,w,1] [y,w,6] [w,z,1] [w,z,6] [z,w,1] [z,w,6] s 1 s 2 w x z y (a) � wx � xy � wy � w´ Figure 34.17 Reducing an instance of the vertex-cover problem to an instance of the hamiltonian- cycle problem.

(b) The undirected graph G 0 produced by the reduction, with the hamiltonian cycle corresponding to the vertex cover highlighted in blue. The vertex cover fw; yg corresponds to edges .s 1 ; Œw; x; 1�/ and .s 2 ; Œy; x; 1�/ appearing in the hamiltonian cycle. Next we show that the size of G 0 is polynomial in the size of G, and hence it takes time polynomial in the size of G to construct G 0 . The vertices of G 0 are those in the gadgets, plus the selector vertices. With 12 vertices per gadget, plus k හ jV j selector vertices, G 0 contains a total of jV 0 j D 12 jEj C k හ 12 jEj C jV j vertices. The edges of G 0 are those in the gadgets, those that go between gadgets, and those connecting selector vertices to gadgets. Each gadget contains 14 edges, totaling 14 jEj in all gadgets. For each vertex u 2 V , graph G 0 has degree.u/  1 edges going between gadgets, so that summed over all vertices in V , 34.5 NP-complete problems 1089 X u2V .degree.u/  1/ D 2 jEj  jV j edges go between gadgets. Finally, G 0 has two edges for each pair consisting of a selector vertex and a vertex of V , totaling 2k jV j such edges. The total number of edges of G 0 is therefore jE 0 j D .14 jEj/ C .2 jEj  jV j/ C .2k jV j/ D 16 jEj C .2k  1/ jV j හ 16 jEj C .2 jV j  1/ jV j : Now we show that the transformation from graph G to G 0 is a reduction. That is, we must show that G has a vertex cover of size k if and only if G 0 has a hamiltonian cycle. Suppose that G D .V; E/ has a vertex cover V  ෂ V , where jV  j D k. Let V  D fu 1 ; u 2 ; : : : ; u k g. As Figure 34.17 shows, we can construct a hamiltonian cycle in G 0 by including the following edges 11 for each vertex u j 2 V  . Start by including edges ˚ .Œu j ; u .i / j ; 6�; Œu j ; u .i C1/ j ; 1�/ W 1 හ i හ degree.u j /  1  , which connect all gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u j . Also include the edges within these gadgets as Figures 34.16(b)3(d) show, depending on whether the edge is covered by one or two vertices in V  . The hamiltonian cycle also includes the edges .s j ; Œu j ; u .1/ j ; 1�/ W 1 හ j හ kg [ f.s j C1 ; Œu j ; u .degree.u j // j ; 6�/ W 1 හ j හ k  1g [ f.s 1 ; Œu k ; u .degree.u k // k ; 6�/g : By inspecting Figure 34.17, you can verify that these edges form a cycle, where u 1 D w and u 2 D y . The cycle starts at s 1 , visits all gadgets corresponding to edges incident on u 1 , then visits s 2 , visits all gadgets corresponding to edges inci- dent on u 2 , and so on, until it returns to s 1 . The cycle visits each gadget either once or twice, depending on whether one or two vertices of V  cover its corresponding edge. Because V  is a vertex cover for G, each edge in E is incident on some vertex in V  , and so the cycle visits each vertex in each gadget of G 0 . Because the cycle also visits every selector vertex, it is hamiltonian. Conversely, suppose that G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / contains a hamiltonian cycle C ෂ E 0 . We claim that the set  D fu 2 V W .s j ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/ 2 C for some 1 හ j හ kg (34.4) 11 Technically, a cycle is deûned as a sequence of vertices rather than edges (see Section B.4). In the interest of clarity, we abuse notation here and deûne the hamiltonian cycle by its edges. 1090 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness is a vertex cover for G. We ûrst argue that the set V  is well deûned, that is, for each selector ver- tex s j , exactly one of the incident edges in the hamiltonian cycle C is of the form .s j ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/ for some vertex u 2 V . To see why, partition the hamiltonian cy- cle C into maximal paths that start at some selector vertex s i , visit one or more gad- gets, and end at some selector vertex s j without passing through any other selector vertex. Let’s call each of these maximal paths a <cover path. = Let P be one such cover path, and orient it going from s i to s j . If P contains the edge .s i ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/ for some vertex u 2 V , then we have shown that one edge incident on s i has the required form. Assume, then, that P contains the edge .s i ; Œv; v .degree.v// ; 6�/ for some vertex v 2 V . This path enters a gadget from the bottom, as drawn in Figures 34.16 and 34.17, and it leaves from the top. It might go through several gadgets, but it always enters from the bottom of a gadget and leaves from the top. The only edges incident on vertices at the top of a gadget either go to the bottoms of other gadgets or to selector vertices. Therefore, after the last gadget in the series of gad- gets visited by P , the edge taken must go to a selector vertex s j , so that P contains an edge of the form .s j ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/, where Œu; u .1/ ; 1� is a vertex at the top of some gadget. To see that not both edges incident on s j have this form, simply reverse the direction of traversing P in the above argument. Having established that the set V  is well deûned, let’s see why it is a vertex cover for G. We have already established that each cover path starts at some s i , takes the edge .s i ; Œu; u .1/ ; 1�/ for some vertex u 2 V , passes through all the gad- gets corresponding to edges in E incident on u, and then ends at some selec- tor vertex s j . (This orientation is the reverse of the orientation in the paragraph above.) Let’s call this cover path P u , and by equation (34.4), the vertex cover V  includes u. Each gadget visited by P u must be � uv or � vu for some v 2 V . For each gadget visited by P u , its vertices are visited by either one or two cover paths. If they are visited by one cover path, then edge .u; v/ 2 E is covered in G by vertex u. If two cover paths visit the gadget, then the other cover path must be P v , which implies that v 2 V  , and edge .u; v/ 2 E is covered by both u and v. Be- cause each vertex in each gadget is visited by some cover path, we see that each edge in E is covered by some vertex in V  . 34.5.4 The traveling-salesperson problem In the traveling-salesperson problem, which is closely related to the hamiltonian- cycle problem, a salesperson must visit n cities. Let’s model the problem as a complete graph with n vertices, so that the salesperson wishes to make a tour, or hamiltonian cycle, visiting each city exactly once and ûnishing at the starting city. The salesperson incurs a nonnegative integer cost c.i; j / to travel from city i 34.5 NP-complete problems 1091 u x w 4 2 3 5 1 1 v Figure 34.18 An instance of the traveling-salesperson problem. Edges highlighted in blue repre- sent a minimum-cost tour, with cost 7. to city j . In the optimization version of the problem, the salesperson wishes to make the tour whose total cost is minimum, where the total cost is the sum of the individual costs along the edges of the tour. For example, in Figure 34.18, a minimum-cost tour is hu; w; v; x; ui, with cost 7. The formal language for the corresponding decision problem is TSP D fhG; c; ki W G D .V; E/ is a complete graph; c is a function from V  V ! N; k 2 N, and G has a traveling-salesperson tour with cost at most kg : The following theorem shows that a fast algorithm for the traveling-salesperson problem is unlikely to exist. Theorem 34.14 The traveling-salesperson problem is NP-complete. Proof We ûrst show that TSP 2 NP. Given an instance of the problem, the certiûcate is the sequence of n vertices in the tour. The veriûcation algorithm checks that this sequence contains each vertex exactly once, sums up the edge costs, and checks that the sum is at most k. This process can certainly be done in polynomial time. To prove that TSP is NP-hard, we show that HAM-CYCLE හ P TSP. Given an instance G D .V; E/ of HAM-CYCLE, construct an instance of TSP by forming the complete graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where E 0 D f.i; j / W i; j 2 V and i ¤ j g, with the cost function c deûned as c.i; j / D ( 0 if .i; j / 2 E ; 1 if .i; j / … E : (Because G is undirected, it contains no self-loops, and so c.v; v/ D 1 for all vertices v 2 V .) The instance of TSP is then hG 0 ; c; 0i, which can be created in polynomial time. 1092 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness We now show that graph G has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if graph G 0 has a tour of cost at most 0. Suppose that graph G has a hamiltonian cycle H . Each edge in H belongs to E and thus has cost 0 in G 0 . Thus, H is a tour in G 0 with cost 0. Conversely, suppose that graph G 0 has a tour H 0 of cost at most 0. Since the costs of the edges in E 0 are 0 and 1, the cost of tour H 0 is exactly 0 and each edge on the tour must have cost 0. Therefore, H 0 contains only edges in E. We conclude that H 0 is a hamiltonian cycle in graph G. 34.5.5 The subset-sum problem We next consider an arithmetic NP-complete problem. The subset-sum problem takes as inputs a ûnite set S of positive integers and an integer target t > 0. It asks whether there exists a subset S 0 ෂ S whose elements sum to exactly t . For example, if S D f1; 2; 7; 14; 49; 98; 343; 686; 2409; 2793; 16808; 17206; 117705; 117993g and t D 138457, then the subset S 0 D f1; 2; 7; 98; 343; 686; 2409; 17206; 117705g is a solution. As usual, we express the problem as a language: SUBSET-SUM D ˚ hS; t i W there exists a subset S 0 ෂ S such that t D P s2S 0 s  : As with any arithmetic problem, it is important to recall that our standard encoding assumes that the input integers are coded in binary. With this assumption in mind, we can show that the subset-sum problem is unlikely to have a fast algorithm. Theorem 34.15 The subset-sum problem is NP-complete. Proof To show that SUBSET-SUM 2 NP, for an instance hS; t i of the problem, let the subset S 0 be the certiûcate. A veriûcation algorithm can check whether t D P s2S 0 s in polynomial time. We now show that 3-CNF-SAT හ P SUBSET-SUM. Given a 3-CNF formula � over variables x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n with clauses C 1 ; C 2 ; : : : ; C k , each containing exactly three distinct literals, the reduction algorithm constructs an instance hS; t i of the subset-sum problem such that � is satisûable if and only if there exists a subset of S whose sum is exactly t . Without loss of generality, we make two simplifying assumptions about the formula �. First, no clause contains both a variable and its negation, for such a clause is automatically satisûed by any assignment of values to the variables. Second, each variable appears in at least one clause, because it does not matter what value is assigned to a variable that appears in no clauses. The reduction creates two numbers in set S for each variable x i and two numbers in S for each clause C j . The numbers will be represented in base 10, with each number containing n C k digits and each digit corresponding to either one variable 34.5 NP-complete problems 1093 = 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 = 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 = 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 = 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 = 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 = 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 = 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 = 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 = 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 x 1 x 2 x 3 C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 v 1 v 0 1 v 2 v 0 2 v 3 v 0 3 s 1 s 0 1 s 2 s 0 2 s 3 s 0 3 s 4 s 0 4 t Figure 34.19 The reduction of 3-CNF-SAT to SUBSET-SUM. The formula in 3-CNF is � D C 1 ^C 2 ^C 3 ^C 4 , where C 1 D .x 1 _:x 2 _:x 3 /, C 2 D .:x 1 _:x 2 _:x 3 /, C 3 D .:x 1 _:x 2 _x 3 /, and C 4 D .x 1 _ x 2 _ x 3 /. A satisfying assignment of � is hx 1 D 0; x 2 D 0; x 3 D 1i. The set S produced by the reduction consists of the base-10 numbers shown: reading from top to bottom, S D f1001001; 1000110; 100001; 101110; 10011; 11100; 1000; 2000; 100; 200; 10; 20; 1; 2 g. The target t is 1114444. The subset S 0 ෂ S is shaded blue, and it contains v 0 1 , v 0 2 , and v 3 , corresponding to the satisfying assignment. Subset S 0 also contains slack variables s 1 , s 0 1 , s 0 2 , s 3 , s 4 , and s 0 4 to achieve the target value of 4 in the digits labeled by C 1 through C 4 . or one clause. Base 10 (and other bases, as we shall see) has the property we need of preventing carries from lower digits to higher digits. As Figure 34.19 shows, we construct set S and target t as follows. Label each digit position by either a variable or a clause. The least signiûcant k digits are labeled by the clauses, and the most signiûcant n digits are labeled by variables.  The target t has a 1 in each digit labeled by a variable and a 4 in each digit labeled by a clause.  For each variable x i , set S contains two integers v i and v 0 i . Each of v i and v 0 i has a 1 in the digit labeled by x i and 0s in the other variable digits. If literal x i appears in clause C j , then the digit labeled by C j in v i contains a 1. If lit- eral :x i appears in clause C j , then the digit labeled by C j in v 0 i contains a 1. All other digits labeled by clauses in v i and v 0 i are 0. 1094 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness All v i and v 0 i values in set S are unique. Why? For ` ¤ i , no v ` or v 0 ` values can equal v i and v 0 i in the most signiûcant n digits. Furthermore, by our simplifying assumptions above, no v i and v 0 i can be equal in all k least signiûcant digits. If v i and v 0 i were equal, then x i and :x i would have to appear in exactly the same set of clauses. But we assume that no clause contains both x i and :x i and that either x i or :x i appears in some clause, and so there must be some clause C j for which v i and v 0 i differ.  For each clause C j , set S contains two integers s j and s 0 j . Each of s j and s 0 j has 0s in all digits other than the one labeled by C j . For s j , there is a 1 in the C j digit, and s 0 j has a 2 in this digit. These integers are <slack variables,= which we use to get each clause-labeled digit position to add to the target value of 4. Simple inspection of Figure 34.19 demonstrates that all s j and s 0 j values in S are unique in set S . The greatest sum of digits in any one digit position is 6, which occurs in the digits labeled by clauses (three 1s from the v i and v 0 i values, plus 1 and 2 from the s j and s 0 j values). Interpreting these numbers in base 10, therefore, no carries can occur from lower digits to higher digits. 12 The reduction can be performed in polynomial time. The set S consists of 2n C 2k values, each of which has n C k digits, and the time to produce each digit is polynomial in n C k. The target t has n C k digits, and the reduction produces each in constant time. Let’s now show that the 3-CNF formula � is satisûable if and only if there exists a subset S 0 ෂ S whose sum is t . First, suppose that � has a satisfying assignment. For i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, if x i D 1 in this assignment, then include v i in S 0 . Otherwise, include v 0 i . In other words, S 0 includes exactly the v i and v 0 i values that correspond to literals with the value 1 in the satisfying assignment. Having included either v i or v 0 i , but not both, for all i , and having put 0 in the digits labeled by variables in all s j and s 0 j , we see that for each variable-labeled digit, the sum of the values of S 0 must be 1, which matches those digits of the target t . Because each clause is satisûed, the clause contains some literal with the value 1. Therefore, each digit labeled by a clause has at least one 1 contributed to its sum by a v i or v 0 i value in S 0 . In fact, one, two, or three literals may be 1 in each clause, and so each clause-labeled digit has a sum of 1, 2, or 3 from the v i and v 0 i values in S 0 . In Figure 34.19 for example, literals :x 1 , :x 2 , and x 3 have the value 1 in a satisfying assignment. Each of clauses C 1 and C 4 contains exactly one of these literals, and so together v 0 1 , v 0 2 , and v 3 contribute 1 to the sum in the digits for C 1 and C 4 . 12 In fact, any base b  7 works. The instance at the beginning of this subsection is the set S and target t in Figure 34.19 interpreted in base 7, with S listed in sorted order. 34.5 NP-complete problems 1095 Clause C 2 contains two of these literals, and v 0 1 , v 0 2 , and v 3 contribute 2 to the sum in the digit for C 2 . Clause C 3 contains all three of these literals, and v 0 1 , v 0 2 , and v 3 contribute 3 to the sum in the digit for C 3 . To achieve the target of 4 in each digit labeled by clause C j , include in S 0 the appropriate nonempty subset of slack variables fs j ; s 0 j g. In Figure 34.19, S 0 includes s 1 , s 0 1 , s 0 2 , s 3 , s 4 , and s 0 4 . Since S 0 matches the target in all digits of the sum, and no carries can occur, the values of S 0 sum to t . Now suppose that some subset S 0 ෂ S sums to t . The subset S 0 must include exactly one of v i and v 0 i for each i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, for otherwise the digits labeled by variables would not sum to 1. If v i 2 S 0 , then set x i D 1. Otherwise, v 0 i 2 S 0 , and set x i D 0. We claim that every clause C j , for j D 1; 2; : : : ; k, is satisûed by this assignment. To prove this claim, note that to achieve a sum of 4 in the digit labeled by C j , the subset S 0 must include at least one v i or v 0 i value that has a 1 in the digit labeled by C j , since the contributions of the slack variables s j and s 0 j together sum to at most 3. If S 0 includes a v i that has a 1 in C j ’s position, then the literal x i appears in clause C j . Since x i D 1 when v i 2 S 0 , clause C j is satisûed. If S 0 includes a v 0 i that has a 1 in that position, then the literal :x i appears in C j . Since x i D 0 when v 0 i 2 S 0 , clause C j is again satisûed. Thus, all clauses of � are satisûed, which completes the proof. 34.5.6 Reduction strategies From the reductions in this section, you can see that no single strategy applies to all NP-complete problems. Some reductions are straightforward, such as reducing the hamiltonian-cycle problem to the traveling-salesperson problem. Others are considerably more complicated. Here are a few things to keep in mind and some strategies that you can often bring to bear. Pitfalls Make sure that you don’t get the reduction backward. That is, in trying to show that problem Y is NP-complete, you might take a known NP-complete problem X and give a polynomial-time reduction from Y to X . That is the wrong direction. The reduction should be from X to Y, so that a solution to Y gives a solution to X . Remember also that reducing a known NP-complete problem X to a problem Y does not in itself prove that Y is NP-complete. It proves that Y is NP-hard. In order to show that Y is NP-complete, you additionally need to prove that it’s in NP by showing how to verify a certiûcate for Y in polynomial time. 1096 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness Go from general to speciﬁc When reducing problem X to problem Y, you always have to start with an arbitrary input to problem X. But you are allowed to restrict the input to problem Y as much as you like. For example, when reducing 3-CNF satisûability to the subset-sum problem, the reduction had to be able to handle any 3-CNF formula as its input, but the input to the subset-sum problem that it produced had a particular structure: 2n C 2k integers in the set, and each integer was formed in a particular way. The reduction did not need to produce every possible input to the subset-sum problem. The point is that one way to solve the 3-CNF satisûability problem transforms the input into an input to the subset-sum problem and then uses the answer to the subset-sum problem as the answer to the 3-CNF satisûability problem. Take advantage of structure in the problem you are reducing from When you are choosing a problem to reduce from, you might consider two prob- lems in the same domain, but one problem has more structure than the other. For example, it’s almost always much easier to reduce from 3-CNF satisûability than to reduce from formula satisûability. Boolean formulas can be arbitrarily compli- cated, but you can exploit the structure of 3-CNF formulas when reducing. Likewise, it is usually more straightforward to reduce from the hamiltonian- cycle problem than from the traveling-salesperson problem, even though they are so similar. That’s because you can view the hamiltonian-cycle problem as taking a complete graph but with edge weights of just 0 or 1, as they would appear in the adjacency matrix. In that sense, the hamiltonian-cycle problem has more structure than the traveling-salesperson problem, in which edge weights are unrestricted. Look for special cases Several NP-complete problems are just special cases of other NP-complete prob- lems. For example, consider the decision version of the 0-1 knapsack problem: given a set of n items, each with a weight and a value, does there exist a subset of items whose total weight is at most a given weight W and whose total value is at least a given value V ? You can view the set-partition problem in Exercise 34.5-5 as a special case of the 0-1 knapsack problem: let the value of each item equal its weight, and set both W and V to half the total weight. If problem X is NP-hard and it is a special case of problem Y, then problem Y must be NP-hard as well. That is because a polynomial-time solution for problem Y automatically gives a polynomial-time solution for problem X. More intuitively, problem Y, being more general than problem X, is at least as hard. 34.5 NP-complete problems 1097 Select an appropriate problem to reduce from It’s often a good strategy to reduce from a problem in a domain that is the same as, or at least related to, the domain of the problem that you’ re trying to prove NP-complete. For example, we saw that the vertex-cover problem4a graph prob- lem4was NP-hard by reducing from the clique problem4also a graph problem. From the vertex-cover problem, we reduced to the hamiltonian-cycle problem, and from the hamiltonian-cycle problem, we reduced to the traveling-salesperson prob- lem. All of these problems take undirected graphs as inputs. Sometimes, however, you will ûnd that is it better to cross over from one do- main to another, such as when we reduced from 3-CNF satisûability to the clique problem or to the subset-sum problem. 3-CNF satisûability often turns out to be a good choice as a problem to reduce from when crossing domains. Within graph problems, if you need to select a portion of the graph, without regard to ordering, then the vertex-cover problem is often a good place to start. If ordering matters, then consider starting from the hamiltonian-cycle or hamiltonian- path problem (see Exercise 34.5-6). Make big rewards and big penalties The strategy for reducing the hamiltonian-cycle problem with a graph G to the traveling-salesperson problem encouraged using edges present in G when choosing edges for the traveling-salesperson tour. The reduction did so by giving these edges a low weight: 0. In other words, we gave a big reward for using these edges. Alternatively, the reduction could have given the edges in G a ûnite weight and given edges not in G inûnite weight, thereby exacting a hefty penalty for using edges not in G. With this approach, if each edge in G has weight W , then the target weight of the traveling-salesperson tour becomes W  jV j. You can some- times think of the penalties as a way to enforce requirements. For example, if the traveling-salesperson tour includes an edge with inûnite weight, then it violates the requirement that the tour should include only edges belonging to G. Design gadgets The reduction from the vertex-cover problem to the hamiltonian-cycle problem uses the gadget shown in Figure 34.16. This gadget is a subgraph that is connected to other parts of the constructed graph in order to restrict the ways that a cycle can visit each vertex in the gadget once. More generally, a gadget is a component that enforces certain properties. Gadgets can be complicated, as in the reduction to the hamiltonian-cycle problem. Or they can be simple: in the reduction of 3-CNF satisûability to the subset-sum problem, you can view the slack variables s j and s 0 j 1098 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness as gadgets enabling each clause-labeled digit position to achieve the target value of 4. Exercises 34.5-1 The subgraph-isomorphism problem takes two undirected graphs G 1 and G 2 , and asks whether G 1 is isomorphic to a subgraph of G 2 . Show that the subgraph- isomorphism problem is NP-complete. 34.5-2 Given an integer m  n matrix A and an integer m-vector b, the 0-1 integer- programming problem asks whether there exists an integer n-vector x with ele- ments in the set f0; 1g such that Ax හ b. Prove that 0-1 integer programming is NP-complete. (Hint: Reduce from 3-CNF-SAT.) 34.5-3 The integer linear-programming problem is like the 0-1 integer-programming problem given in Exercise 34.5-2, except that the values of the vector x may be any integers rather than just 0 or 1. Assuming that the 0-1 integer-programming problem is NP-hard, show that the integer linear-programming problem is NP- complete. 34.5-4 Show how to solve the subset-sum problem in polynomial time if the target value t is expressed in unary. 34.5-5 The set-partition problem takes as input a set S of numbers. The question is whether the numbers can be partitioned into two sets A and A D S  A such that P x2A x D P x2 A x . Show that the set-partition problem is NP-complete. 34.5-6 Show that the hamiltonian-path problem is NP-complete. 34.5-7 The longest-simple-cycle problem is the problem of determining a simple cycle (no repeated vertices) of maximum length in a graph. Formulate a related decision problem, and show that the decision problem is NP-complete. Problems for Chapter 34 1099 34.5-8 In the half 3-CNF satisûability problem, the input is a 3-CNF formula � with n variables and m clauses, where m is even. The question is whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables of � such that exactly half the clauses evaluate to 0 and exactly half the clauses evaluate to 1. Prove that the half 3-CNF satisûability problem is NP-complete. 34.5-9 The proof that VERTEX-COVER හ P HAM-CYCLE assumes that the graph G given as input to the vertex-cover problem has no isolated vertices. Show how the reduction in the proof can break down if G has an isolated vertex. Problems 34-1 Independent set An independent set of a graph G D .V; E/ is a subset V 0 ෂ V of vertices such that each edge in E is incident on at most one vertex in V 0 . The independent-set problem is to ûnd a maximum-size independent set in G. a. Formulate a related decision problem for the independent-set problem, and prove that it is NP-complete. (Hint: Reduce from the clique problem.) b. You are given a <black-box= subroutine to solve the decision problem you de- ûned in part (a). Give an algorithm to ûnd an independent set of maximum size. The running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in jV j and jEj, counting queries to the black box as a single step. Although the independent-set decision problem is NP-complete, certain special cases are polynomial-time solvable. c. Give an efûcient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when each ver- tex in G has degree 2. Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works correctly. d. Give an efûcient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when G is bipartite. Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorithm works cor- rectly. (Hint: First prove that in a bipartite graph, the size of the maximimum independent set plus the size of the maximum matching is equal to jV j. Then use a maximum-matching algorithm (see Section 25.1) as a ûrst step in an al- gorithm to ûnd an independent set.) 1100 Chapter 34 NP-Completeness 34-2 Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde have just robbed a bank. They have a bag of money and want to divide it up. For each of the following scenarios, either give a polynomial-time algorithm to divide the money or prove that the problem of dividing the money in the manner described is NP-complete. The input in each case is a list of the n items in the bag, along with the value of each. a. The bag contains n coins, but only two different denominations: some coins are worth x dollars, and some are worth y dollars. Bonnie and Clyde wish to divide the money exactly evenly. b. The bag contains n coins, with an arbitrary number of different denominations, but each denomination is a nonnegative exact power of 2, so that the possible denominations are 1 dollar, 2 dollars, 4 dollars, etc. Bonnie and Clyde wish to divide the money exactly evenly. c. The bag contains n checks, which are, in an amazing coincidence, made out to <Bonnie or Clyde.= They wish to divide the checks so that they each get the exact same amount of money. d. The bag contains n checks as in part (c), but this time Bonnie and Clyde are willing to accept a split in which the difference is no larger than 100 dollars. 34-3 Graph coloring Mapmakers try to use as few colors as possible when coloring countries on a map, subject to the restriction that if two countries share a border, they must have dif- ferent colors. You can model this problem with an undirected graph G D .V; E/ in which each vertex represents a country and vertices whose respective countries share a border are adjacent. Then, a k-coloring is a function c W V ! f1; 2; : : : ; kg such that c.u/ ¤ c.v/ for every edge .u; v/ 2 E. In other words, the numbers 1; 2; : : : ; k represent the k colors, and adjacent vertices must have different col- ors. The graph-coloring problem is to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color a given graph. a. Give an efûcient algorithm to determine a 2-coloring of a graph, if one exists. b. Cast the graph-coloring problem as a decision problem. Show that your deci- sion problem is solvable in polynomial time if and only if the graph-coloring problem is solvable in polynomial time. c. Let the language 3-COLOR be the set of graphs that can be 3-colored. Show that if 3-COLOR is NP-complete, then your decision problem from part (b) is NP-complete.

To prove that 3-COLOR is NP-complete, you can reduce from 3-CNF-SAT. Given a formula � of m clauses on n variables x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n , construct a graph G D .V; E/ as follows. The set V consists of a vertex for each variable, a vertex for the negation of each variable, ûve vertices for each clause, and three special vertices: TRUE, FALSE, and RED. The edges of the graph are of two types: <lit- eral= edges that are independent of the clauses and <clause= edges that depend on the clauses. As Figure 34.20 shows, the literal edges form a triangle on the three special vertices TRUE, FALSE, and RED, and they also form a triangle on x i , :x i , and RED for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. d.

Each task a j requires t j time units on the computer (its processing time), yields a proût of p j , and has a deadline d j . The computer can process only one task at a time, and task a j must run without interruption for t j consecutive time units. If task a j completes by its deadline d j , you receive a proût p j . If instead task a j completes after its deadline, you receive no proût. As an optimization problem, given the processing times, proûts, and deadlines for a set of n tasks, you wish to ûnd a schedule that completes all the tasks and returns the greatest amount of proût. The processing times, proûts, and deadlines are all nonnegative numbers. a. State this problem as a decision problem. b. Show that the decision problem is NP-complete. c. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the decision problem, assuming that all processing times are integers from 1 to n. (Hint: Use dynamic programming.) d. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for the optimization problem, assuming that all processing times are integers from 1 to n. Chapter notes The book by Garey and Johnson [176] provides a wonderful guide to NP-complete- ness, discussing the theory at length and providing a catalogue of many problems that were known to be NP-complete in 1979. The proof of Theorem 34.13 is adapted from their book, and the list of NP-complete problem domains at the be- ginning of Section 34.5 is drawn from their table of contents. Johnson wrote a se- ries of 23 columns in the Journal of Algorithms between 1981 and 1992 reporting new developments in NP-completeness. Fortnow’s book [152] gives a history of NP-completeness, along with societal implications. Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ull- man [225], Lewis and Papadimitriou [299], Papadimitriou [352], and Sipser [413] have good treatments of NP-completeness in the context of complexity theory. NP-completeness and several reductions also appear in books by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [5], Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani [107], Johnsonbaugh and Notes for Chapter 34 1103 Schaefer [239], and Kleinberg and Tardos [257]. The book by Hromkoviˇ c [229] studies various methods for solving hard problems. The class P was introduced in 1964 by Cobham [96] and, independently, in 1965 by Edmonds [130], who also introduced the class NP and conjectured that P ¤ NP. The notion of NP-completeness was proposed in 1971 by Cook [100], who gave the ûrst NP-completeness proofs for formula satisûability and 3-CNF satisûabil- ity. Levin [297] independently discovered the notion, giving an NP-completeness proof for a tiling problem. Karp [248] introduced the methodology of reductions in 1972 and demonstrated the rich variety of NP-complete problems. Karp’s pa- per included the original NP-completeness proofs of the clique, vertex-cover, and hamiltonian-cycle problems. Since then, thousands of problems have been proven to be NP-complete by many researchers. Work in complexity theory has shed light on the complexity of computing ap- proximate solutions. This work gives a new deûnition of NP using <probabilis- tically checkable proofs.= This new deûnition implies that for problems such as clique, vertex cover, the traveling-salesperson problem with the triangle inequal- ity, and many others, computing good approximate solutions (see Chapter 35) is NP-hard and hence no easier than computing optimal solutions. An introduction to this area can be found in Arora’s thesis [21], a chapter by Arora and Lund in Hochbaum [221], a survey article by Arora [22], a book edited by Mayr, Pr¨ omel, and Steger [319], a survey article by Johnson [237], and a chapter in the textbook by Arora and Barak [24]. 35 Approximation Algorithms Many problems of practical signiûcance are NP-complete, yet they are too impor- tant to abandon merely because nobody knows how to ûnd an optimal solution in polynomial time. Even if a problem is NP-complete, there may be hope. You have at least three options to get around NP-completeness. First, if the actual inputs are small, an algorithm with exponential running time might be fast enough. Second, you might be able to isolate important special cases that you can solve in polyno- mial time. Third, you can try to devise an approach to ûnd a near-optimal solution in polynomial time (either in the worst case or the expected case). In practice, near- optimality is often good enough. We call an algorithm that returns near-optimal solutions an approximation algorithm. This chapter presents polynomial-time ap- proximation algorithms for several NP-complete problems. Performance ratios for approximation algorithms Suppose that you are working on an optimization problem in which each potential solution has a positive cost, and you want to ûnd a near-optimal solution. Depend- ing on the problem, you could deûne an optimal solution as one with maximum possible cost or as one with minimum possible cost, which is to say that the prob- lem might be either a maximization or a minimization problem. We say that an algorithm for a problem has an approximation ratio of �.n/ if, for any input of size n, the cost C of the solution produced by the algorithm is within a factor of �.n/ of the cost C  of an optimal solution: max ï C C  ; C  C ð හ �.n/ : (35.1) If an algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of �.n/, we call it a .n/-approxi- mation algorithm. The deûnitions of approximation ratio and �.n/-approximation algorithm apply to both minimization and maximization problems. For a maxi- mization problem, 0 < C හ C  , and the ratio C  =C gives the factor by which Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms 1105 the cost of an optimal solution is larger than the cost of the approximate solution. Similarly, for a minimization problem, 0 < C  හ C , and the ratio C =C  gives the factor by which the cost of the approximate solution is larger than the cost of an optimal solution. Because we assume that all solutions have positive cost, these ratios are always well deûned. The approximation ratio of an approximation al- gorithm is never less than 1, since C =C  හ 1 implies C  =C  1. Therefore, a 1-approximation algorithm 1 produces an optimal solution, and an approximation algorithm with a large approximation ratio may return a solution that is much worse than optimal. For many problems, we know of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with small constant approximation ratios, although for other problems, the best known polynomial-time approximation algorithms have approximation ratios that grow as functions of the input size n. An example of such a problem is the set-cover problem presented in Section 35.3. Some polynomial-time approximation algorithms can achieve increasingly bet- ter approximation ratios by using more and more computation time. For such problems, you can trade computation time for the quality of the approximation. An example is the subset-sum problem studied in Section 35.5. This situation is important enough to deserve a name of its own. An approximation scheme for an optimization problem is an approximation al- gorithm that takes as input not only an instance of the problem, but also a value � > 0 such that for any ûxed � , the scheme is a .1 C �/-approximation algorithm. We say that an approximation scheme is a polynomial-time approximation scheme if for any ûxed � > 0, the scheme runs in time polynomial in the size n of its input instance. The running time of a polynomial-time approximation scheme can increase very rapidly as � decreases. For example, the running time of a polynomial-time ap- proximation scheme might be O.n 2= /. Ideally, if � decreases by a constant factor, the running time to achieve the desired approximation should not increase by more than a constant factor (though not necessarily the same constant factor by which � decreased). We say that an approximation scheme is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme if it is an approximation scheme and its running time is polynomial in both 1=� and the size n of the input instance. For example, the scheme might have a running time of O..1=�/ 2 n 3 /. With such a scheme, any constant-factor decrease in � comes with a corresponding constant-factor increase in the running time. 1 When the approximation ratio is independent of n, we use the terms <approximation ratio of �= and <�-approximation algorithm,= indicating no dependence on n. 1106 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms Chapter outline The ûrst four sections of this chapter present some examples of polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems, and the ûfth section gives a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We begin in Section 35.1 with a study of the vertex-cover problem, an NP-complete minimization problem that has an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio of 2. Section 35.2 looks at a version of the traveling-salesperson problem in which the cost function satisûes the triangle inequality and presents an approximation algorithm with an approxi- mation ratio of 2. The section also shows that without the triangle inequality, for any constant �  1, a �-approximation algorithm cannot exist unless P D NP. Section 35.3 applies a greedy method as an effective approximation algorithm for the set-covering problem, obtaining a covering whose cost is at worst a logarithmic factor larger than the optimal cost. Section 35.4 uses randomization and linear pro- gramming to develop two more approximation algorithms. The section ûrst deûnes the optimization version of 3-CNF satisûability and gives a simple randomized algorithm that produces a solution with an expected approximation ratio of 8=7. Then Section 35.4 examines a weighted variant of the vertex-cover problem and exhibits how to use linear programming to develop a 2-approximation algorithm. Finally, Section 35.5 presents a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the subset-sum problem. 35.1 The vertex-cover problem Section 34.5.2 deûned the vertex-cover problem and proved it NP-complete. Recall that a vertex cover of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ is a subset V 0 ෂ V such that if .u; v/ is an edge of G, then either u 2 V 0 or v 2 V 0 (or both). The size of a vertex cover is the number of vertices in it. The vertex-cover problem is to ûnd a vertex cover of minimum size in a given undirected graph. We call such a vertex cover an optimal vertex cover. This prob- lem is the optimization version of an NP-complete decision problem. Even though nobody knows how to ûnd an optimal vertex cover in a graph G in polynomial time, there is an efûcient algorithm to ûnd a vertex cover that is near- optimal. The approximation algorithm APPROX-VERTEX-COVER on the facing page takes as input an undirected graph G and returns a vertex cover whose size is guaranteed to be no more than twice the size of an optimal vertex cover. Figure 35.1 illustrates how APPROX-VERTEX-COVER operates on an example graph. The variable C contains the vertex cover being constructed. Line 1 initial- izes C to the empty set. Line 2 sets E 0 to be a copy of the edge set G: E of the graph. The while loop of lines 336 repeatedly picks an edge .u; v/ from E 0 , adds 35.1 The vertex-cover problem 1107 APPROX-VERTEX-COVER .G/ 1 C D ; 2 E 0 D G: E 3 while E 0 ¤ ; 4 let .u; v/ be an arbitrary edge of E 0 5 C D C [ fu; vg 6 remove from E 0 edge .u; v/ and every edge incident on either u or v 7 return C its endpoints u and v into C , and deletes all edges in E 0 that u or v covers. Finally, line 7 returns the vertex cover C . The running time of this algorithm is O.V C E/, using adjacency lists to represent E 0 . Theorem 35.1 APPROX-VERTEX-COVER is a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm. Proof We have already shown that APPROX-VERTEX-COVER runs in polyno- mial time. The set C of vertices that is returned by APPROX-VERTEX-COVER is a vertex cover, since the algorithm loops until every edge in G: E has been covered by some vertex in C . To see that APPROX-VERTEX-COVER returns a vertex cover that is at most twice the size of an optimal cover, let A denote the set of edges that line 4 of A PPROX- VERTEX-COVER picked. In order to cover the edges in A, any vertex cover4in particular, an optimal cover C  4must include at least one endpoint of each edge in A. No two edges in A share an endpoint, since once an edge is picked in line 4, all other edges that are incident on its endpoints are deleted from E 0 in line 6. Thus, no two edges in A are covered by the same vertex from C  , meaning that for every vertex in C  , there is at most one edge in A, giving the lower bound jC  j  jAj (35.2) on the size of an optimal vertex cover. Each execution of line 4 picks an edge for which neither of its endpoints is already in C , yielding an upper bound (an exact upper bound, in fact) on the size of the vertex cover returned: jC j D 2 jAj : (35.3) Combining equations (35.2) and (35.3) yields jC j D 2 jAj හ 2 jC  j ; thereby proving the theorem. 1108 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms b c d a e f g (a) b c d a e f g (b) b c d a e f g (c) b c d a e f g (d) b c d a e f g (e) b c d a e f g (f) Figure 35.1 The operation of A PPROX-VERTEX-COVER.

(f) The optimal vertex cover for this problem contains only three vertices: b, d , and e. Let us reüect on this proof. At ûrst, you might wonder how you can possibly prove that the size of the vertex cover returned by APPROX-VERTEX-COVER is at most twice the size of an optimal vertex cover, when you don’t even know the size of an optimal vertex cover. Instead of requiring that you know the exact size of an optimal vertex cover, you ûnd a lower bound on the size. As Exercise 35.1-2 asks you to show, the set A of edges that line 4 of APPROX-VERTEX-COVER selects is actually a maximal matching in the graph G. (A maximal matching is a matching to which no edges can be added and still have a matching.) The size of a maximal matching is, as we argued in the proof of Theorem 35.1, a lower bound on the size of an optimal vertex cover. The algorithm returns a vertex cover whose size is at most twice the size of the maximal matching A. The approximation ratio comes from relating the size of the solution returned to the lower bound. We will use this methodology in later sections as well. 35.2 The traveling-salesperson problem 1109 Exercises 35.1-1 Give an example of a graph for which A PPROX-VERTEX-COVER always yields a suboptimal solution. 35.1-2 Prove that the set of edges picked in line 4 of A PPROX-VERTEX-COVER forms a maximal matching in the graph G. ? 35.1-3 Consider the following heuristic to solve the vertex-cover problem. Repeatedly select a vertex of highest degree, and remove all of its incident edges. Give an example to show that this heuristic does not provide an approximation ratio of 2. (Hint: Try a bipartite graph with vertices of uniform degree on the left and vertices of varying degree on the right.) 35.1-4 Give an efûcient greedy algorithm that ûnds an optimal vertex cover for a tree in linear time. 35.1-5 The proof of Theorem 34.12 on page 1084 illustrates that the vertex-cover problem and the NP-complete clique problem are complementary in the sense that an opti- mal vertex cover is the complement of a maximum-size clique in the complement graph. Does this relationship imply that there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio for the clique problem? Justify your answer. 35.2 The traveling-salesperson problem The input to the traveling-salesperson problem, introduced in Section 34.5.4, is a complete undirected graph G D .V; E/ that has a nonnegative integer cost c.u; v/ associated with each edge .u; v/ 2 E. The goal is to ûnd a hamiltonian cycle (a tour) of G with minimum cost. As an extension of our notation, let c.A/ denote the total cost of the edges in the subset A ෂ E: c.A/ D X .u;v/2A c.u; v/ : 1110 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms In many practical situations, the least costly way to go from a place u to a place w is to go directly, with no intermediate steps. Put another way, cutting out an inter- mediate stop never increases the cost. Such a cost function c satisûes the triangle inequality: for all vertices u; v; w 2 V , c.u; w/ හ c.u; v/ C c.v; w/ : The triangle inequality seems as though it should naturally hold, and it is au- tomatically satisûed in several applications. For example, if the vertices of the graph are points in the plane and the cost of traveling between two vertices is the ordinary euclidean distance between them, then the triangle inequality is satisûed. Furthermore, many cost functions other than euclidean distance satisfy the triangle inequality. As Exercise 35.2-2 shows, the traveling-salesperson problem is NP-complete even if you require the cost function to satisfy the triangle inequality. Thus, you should not expect to ûnd a polynomial-time algorithm for solving this problem ex- actly. Your time would be better spent looking for good approximation algorithms. In Section 35.2.1, we examine a 2-approximation algorithm for the traveling- salesperson problem with the triangle inequality. In Section 35.2.2, we show that without the triangle inequality, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio does not exist unless P D NP. 35.2.1 The traveling-salesperson problem with the triangle inequality Applying the methodology of the previous section, start by computing a structure 4a minimum spanning tree4whose weight gives a lower bound on the length of an optimal traveling-salesperson tour. Then use the minimum spanning tree to cre- ate a tour whose cost is no more than twice that of the minimum spanning tree’s weight, as long as the cost function satisûes the triangle inequality. The proce- dure APPROX-TSP-TOUR on the next page implements this approach, calling the minimum-spanning-tree algorithm MST-PRIM on page 596 as a subroutine. The parameter G is a complete undirected graph, and the cost function c satisûes the triangle inequality. Recall from Section 12.1 that a preorder tree walk recursively visits every vertex in the tree, listing a vertex when it is ûrst encountered, before visiting any of its children. Figure 35.2 illustrates the operation of APPROX-TSP-TOUR. Part (a) of the ûg- ure shows a complete undirected graph, and part (b) shows the minimum spanning tree T grown from root vertex a by MST-PRIM. Part (c) shows how a preorder walk of T visits the vertices, and part (d) displays the corresponding tour, which is the tour returned by APPROX-TSP-TOUR. Part (e) displays an optimal tour, which is about 23% shorter. 35.2 The traveling-salesperson problem 1111 (a) a d b f e g c h (b) a d b f e g c h (c) a d e c h (d) a d b f e g c h (e) b f g e h c a b f g d Figure 35.2 The operation of A PPROX-TSP-TOUR.

We now show that if the cost function for an instance of the traveling-salesperson problem satisûes the triangle inequal- ity, then APPROX-TSP-TOUR returns a tour whose cost is at most twice the cost of an optimal tour. Theorem 35.2 When the triangle inequality holds, APPROX-TSP-TOUR is a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for the traveling-salesperson problem. Proof We have already seen that APPROX-TSP-TOUR runs in polynomial time. Let H  denote an optimal tour for the given set of vertices. Deleting any edge from a tour yields a spanning tree, and each edge cost is nonnegative. Therefore, the weight of the minimum spanning tree T computed in line 2 of APPROX-TSP- TOUR provides a lower bound on the cost of an optimal tour: c.T / හ c.H  / : (35.4) A full walk of T lists the vertices when they are ûrst visited and also whenever they are returned to after a visit to a subtree. Let’s call this full walk W . The full walk of our example gives the order a; b; c; b; h; b; a; d; e; f; e; g; e; d; a : Since the full walk traverses every edge of T exactly twice, by extending the deû- nition of the cost c in the natural manner to handle multisets of edges, we have c.W / D 2c.T / : (35.5) Inequality (35.4) and equation (35.5) imply that c.W / හ 2c.H  / ; (35.6) and so the cost of W is within a factor of 2 of the cost of an optimal tour. Of course, the full walk W is not a tour, since it visits some vertices more than once. By the triangle inequality, however, deleting a visit to any vertex from W does not increase the cost. (When a vertex v is deleted from W between visits to u and w, the resulting ordering speciûes going directly from u to w.) Repeatedly apply this operation on each visit to a vertex after the ûrst time it’s visited in W , so that W is left with only the ûrst visit to each vertex. In our example, this process leaves the ordering a; b; c; h; d; e; f; g : This ordering is the same as that obtained by a preorder walk of the tree T . Let H be the cycle corresponding to this preorder walk. It is a hamiltonian cycle, since ev- 35.2 The traveling-salesperson problem 1113 ery vertex is visited exactly once, and in fact it is the cycle computed by A PPROX- TSP-TOUR. Since H is obtained by deleting vertices from the full walk W , we have c.H / හ c.W / : (35.7) Combining inequalities (35.6) and (35.7) gives c.H / හ 2c.H  /, which completes the proof. Despite the small approximation ratio provided by Theorem 35.2, A PPROX- TSP-TOUR is usually not the best practical choice for this problem. There are other approximation algorithms that typically perform much better in practice. (See the references at the end of this chapter.) 35.2.2 The general traveling-salesperson problem When the cost function c does not satisfy the triangle inequality, there is no way to ûnd good approximate tours in polynomial time unless P D NP. Theorem 35.3 If P ¤ NP, then for any constant �  1, there is no polynomial-time approxi- mation algorithm with approximation ratio � for the general traveling-salesperson problem. Proof The proof is by contradiction. Suppose to the contrary that for some num- ber �  1, there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm A with approxima- tion ratio �. Without loss of generality, assume that � is an integer, by rounding it up if necessary. We will show how to use A to solve instances of the hamiltonian- cycle problem (deûned in Section 34.2) in polynomial time. Since Theorem 34.13 on page 1085 says that the hamiltonian-cycle problem is NP-complete, Theo- rem 34.4 on page 1063 implies that if it has a polynomial-time algorithm, then P D NP. Let G D .V; E/ be an instance of the hamiltonian-cycle problem. We will show how to determine efûciently whether G contains a hamiltonian cycle by making use of the hypothesized approximation algorithm A. Convert G into an instance of the traveling-salesperson problem as follows. Let G 0 D .V; E 0 / be the complete graph on V , that is, E 0 D f.u; v/ W u; v 2 V and u ¤ vg : Assign an integer cost to each edge in E 0 as follows: c.u; v/ D ( 1 if .u; v/ 2 E ; � jV j C 1 otherwise : 1114 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms Given a representation of G, it takes time polynomial in jV j and jEj to create representations of G 0 and c . Now consider the traveling-salesperson problem .G 0 ; c/. If the original graph G has a hamiltonian cycle H , then the cost function c assigns to each edge of H a cost of 1, and so .G 0 ; c/ contains a tour of cost jV j. On the other hand, if G does not contain a hamiltonian cycle, then any tour of G 0 must use some edge not in E. But any tour that uses an edge not in E has a cost of at least .� jV j C 1/ C .jV j  1/ D � jV j C jV j > � jV j : Because edges not in G are so costly, there is a gap of at least � jV j between the cost of a tour that is a hamiltonian cycle in G (cost jV j) and the cost of any other tour (cost at least � jV j C jV j). Therefore, the cost of a tour that is not a hamiltonian cycle in G is at least a factor of � C 1 greater than the cost of a tour that is a hamiltonian cycle in G. What happens upon applying the approximation algorithm A to the traveling- salesperson problem .G 0 ; c/? Because A is guaranteed to return a tour of cost no more than � times the cost of an optimal tour, if G contains a hamiltonian cycle, then A must return it. If G has no hamiltonian cycle, then A returns a tour of cost more than � jV j. Therefore, using A solves the hamiltonian-cycle problem in polynomial time. The proof of Theorem 35.3 serves as an example of a general technique to prove that no good approximation algorithm exists for a particular problem. Given an NP-hard decision problem X , produce in polynomial time a minimization prob- lem Y such that <yes= instances of X correspond to instances of Y with value at most k (for some k), but that <no= instances of X correspond to instances of Y with value greater than �k. This technique shows that, unless P D NP, there is no polynomial-time �-approximation algorithm for problem Y . Exercises 35.2-1 Let G D .V; E/ be a complete undirected graph containing at least 3 vertices, and let c be a cost function that satisûes the triangle inequality. Prove that c.u; v/  0 for all u; v 2 V . 35.2-2 Show how in polynomial time to transform one instance of the traveling-sales- person problem into another instance whose cost function satisûes the triangle in- equality. The two instances must have the same set of optimal tours. Explain why 35.3 The set-covering problem 1115 such a polynomial-time transformation does not contradict Theorem 35.3, assum- ing that P ¤ NP. 35.2-3 Consider the following closest-point heuristic for building an approximate trav- eling-salesperson tour whose cost function satisûes the triangle inequality. Begin with a trivial cycle consisting of a single arbitrarily chosen vertex. At each step, identify the vertex u that is not on the cycle but whose distance to any vertex on the cycle is minimum. Suppose that the vertex on the cycle that is nearest u is vertex v. Extend the cycle to include u by inserting u just after v. Repeat until all vertices are on the cycle. Prove that this heuristic returns a tour whose total cost is not more than twice the cost of an optimal tour. 35.2-4 A solution to the bottleneck traveling-salesperson problem is the hamiltonian cy- cle that minimizes the cost of the most costly edge in the cycle. Assuming that the cost function satisûes the triangle inequality, show that there exists a polynomial- time approximation algorithm with approximation ratio 3 for this problem. (Hint: Show recursively how to visit all the nodes in a bottleneck spanning tree, as dis- cussed in Problem 21-4 on page 601, exactly once by taking a full walk of the tree and skipping nodes, but without skipping more than two consecutive intermedi- ate nodes. Show that the costliest edge in a bottleneck spanning tree has a cost bounded from above by the cost of the costliest edge in a bottleneck hamiltonian cycle.) 35.2-5 Suppose that the vertices for an instance of the traveling-salesperson problem are points in the plane and that the cost c.u; v/ is the euclidean distance between points u and v. Show that an optimal tour never crosses itself. 35.2-6 Adapt the proof of Theorem 35.3 to show that for any constant c  0, there is no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with approximation ratio jV j c for the general traveling-salesperson problem. 35.3 The set-covering problem The set-covering problem is an optimization problem that models many problems that require resources to be allocated. Its corresponding decision problem gener- alizes the NP-complete vertex-cover problem and is therefore also NP-hard. The 1116 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms approximation algorithm developed to handle the vertex-cover problem doesn’t ap- ply here, however. Instead, this section investigates a simple greedy heuristic with a logarithmic approximation ratio. That is, as the size of the instance gets larger, the size of the approximate solution may grow, relative to the size of an optimal solution. Because the logarithm function grows rather slowly, however, this ap- proximation algorithm may nonetheless give useful results. An instance .X; F / of the set-covering problem consists of a ûnite set X and a family F of subsets of X , such that every element of X belongs to at least one subset in F : X D [ S2F S : We say that a subfamily C ෂ F covers a set of elements U if U ෂ [ S 2C S : The problem is to ûnd a minimum-size subfamily C ෂ F whose members cover all of X : X D [ S2C S : Figure 35.3 illustrates the set-covering problem. The size of C is the number of sets it contains, rather than the number of individual elements in these sets, since every subfamily C that covers X must contain all jX j individual elements. In Figure 35.3, the minimum set cover has size 3. The set-covering problem abstracts many commonly arising combinatorial prob- lems. As a simple example, suppose that X represents a set of skills that are needed to solve a problem and that you have a given set of people available to work on the problem. You wish to form a committee, containing as few people as possible, such that for every requisite skill in X , at least one member of the committee has that skill. The decision version of the set-covering problem asks whether a covering ex- ists with size at most k, where k is an additional parameter speciûed in the problem instance. The decision version of the problem is NP-complete, as Exercise 35.3-2 asks you to show. greedy approximation algorithm The greedy method in the procedure G REEDY-SET-COVER on the facing page works by picking, at each stage, the set S that covers the greatest number of re- maining elements that are uncovered. In the example of Figure 35.3, GREEDY- SET-COVER adds to C , in order, the sets S 1 , S 4 , and S 5 , followed by either S 3 or S 6 . 35.3 The set-covering problem 1117 S 3 S 6 S 4 S 5 S 2 S 1 Figure 35.3 An instance .X; F / of the set-covering problem, where X consists of the 12 tan points and F D fS 1 ; S 2 ; S 3 ; S 4 ; S 5 ; S 6 g. Each set S i 2 F is outlined in blue. A minimum-size set cover is C D fS 3 ; S 4 ; S 5 g, with size 3. The greedy algorithm produces a cover of size 4 by selecting either the sets S 1 , S 4 , S 5 , and S 3 or the sets S 1 , S 4 , S 5 , and S 6 , in order. GREEDY-SET-COVER .X; F / 1 U 0 D X 2 C D ; 3 i D 0 4 while U i ¤ ; 5 select S 2 F that maximizes jS \\ U i j 6 U i C1 D U i  S 7 C D C [ fS g 8 i D i C 1 9 return C The greedy algorithm works as follows. At the start of each iteration, U i is a subset of X containing the remaining uncovered elements, with the initial sub- set U 0 containing all the elements in X . The set C contains the subfamily being constructed. Line 5 is the greedy decision-making step, choosing a subset S that covers as many uncovered elements as possible (breaking ties arbitrarily). After S is selected, line 6 updates the set of remaining uncovered elements, denoting it by U i C1 , and line 7 places S into C . When the algorithm terminates, C is a subfamily of F that covers X . Analysis We now show that the greedy algorithm returns a set cover that is not too much larger than an optimal set cover. 1118 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms Theorem 35.4 The procedure GREEDY-SET-COVER run on a set X and family of subsets F is a polynomial-time O.lg X /-approximation algorithm. Proof Let’s ûrst show that the algorithm runs in time that is polynomial in jX j and jF j. The number of iterations of the loop in lines 437 is bounded above by min fjX j ; jF jg D O.jX j C jF j/. The loop body can be implemented to run in O.jX jjF j/ time. Thus the algorithm runs in O.jX jjF j .jX jCjF j// time, which is polynomial in the input size. (Exercise 35.3-3 asks for a linear-time algorithm.) To prove the approximation bound, let C  be an optimal set cover for the original instance .X; F /, and let k D jC  j. Since C  is also a set cover of each subset U i of X constructed by the algorithm, we know that any subset U i constructed by the algorithm can be covered by k sets. Therefore, if .U i ; F / is an instance of the set-covering problem, its optimal set cover has size at most k. If an optimal set cover for an instance .U i ; F / has size at most k, at least one of the sets in C covers at least jU i j =k new elements. Thus, line 5 of GREEDY- SET-COVER, which chooses a set with the maximum number of uncovered ele- ments, must choose a set in which the number of newly covered elements is at least jU i j =k. These elements are removed when constructing U i C1 , giving jU i C1 j හ jU i j  jU i j =k D jU i j .1  1=k/ : (35.8) Iterating inequality (35.8) gives jU 0 j D jX j ; jU 1 j හ jU 0 j .1  1=k/ ; jU 2 j හ jU 1 j .1  1=k/ D jU j .1  1=k/ 2 ; and in general U i j හ jU 0 j .1  1=k/ i D jX j .1  1=k/ i : (35.9) The algorithm stops when U i D ;, which means that jU i j < 1. Thus an upper bound on the number of iterations of the algorithm is the smallest value of i for which jU i j < 1. Since 1 C x හ e x for all real x (see inequality (3.14) on page 66), by letting x D 1=k, we have 1  1=k හ e 1=k , so that .1  1=k/ k හ .e 1=k / k D 1=e. Denoting the number i of iterations by ck for some nonnegative integer c , we want c such that jX j .1  1=k/ ck හ jX j e c < 1 : (35.10) Multiplying both sides by e c and then taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives c  ln jX j, so we can choose for c any integer that is at least ln jX j. We 35.4 Randomization and linear programming 1119 choose c D dln jX je. Since i D ck is an upper bound on the number of iterations, which equals the size of C , and k D jC  j, we have jC j හ i D ck D c jC  j D jC  j dln jX je, and the theorem follows.

It starts with a simple randomized algo- rithm for an optimization version of 3-CNF satisûability, and then it shows how to design an approximation algorithm for a weighted version of the vertex-cover problem based on linear programming. This section only scratches the surface of 1120 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms these two powerful techniques. The chapter notes give references for further study of these areas. randomized approximation algorithm for MAX-3-CNF satisﬁability Just as some randomized algorithms compute exact solutions, some randomized algorithms compute approximate solutions. We say that a randomized algorithm for a problem has an approximation ratio of �.n/ if, for any input of size n, the expected cost C of the solution produced by the randomized algorithm is within a factor of �.n/ of the cost C  of an optimal solution: max ï C C  ; C  C ð හ �.n/ : (35.11) We call a randomized algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of �.n/ a randomized .n/-approximation algorithm. In other words, a randomized ap- proximation algorithm is like a deterministic approximation algorithm, except that the approximation ratio is for an expected cost. A particular instance of 3-CNF satisûability, as deûned in Section 34.4, may or may not be satisûable. In order to be satisûable, there must exist an assignment of the variables so that every clause evaluates to 1. If an instance is not satisûable, you might instead want to know how <close= to satisûable it is, that is, ûnd an assign- ment of the variables that satisûes as many clauses as possible. We call the resulting maximization problem MAX-3-CNF satisûability. The input to MAX-3-CNF sat- isûability is the same as for 3-CNF satisûability, and the goal is to return an assign- ment of the variables that maximizes the number of clauses evaluating to 1. You might be surprised that randomly setting each variable to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2 yields a randomized 8=7-approximation algorithm, but we’re about to see why. Recall that the deûnition of 3-CNF satisûability from Section 34.4 requires each clause to consist of exactly three distinct literals. We now further assume that no clause contains both a variable and its negation. Exer- cise 35.4-1 asks you to remove this last assumption. Theorem 35.5 Given an instance of MAX-3-CNF satisûability with n variables x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n and m clauses, the randomized algorithm that independently sets each variable to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2 is a randomized 8=7-approxi- mation algorithm. Proof Suppose that each variable is independently set to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probability 1=2. Deûne, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m, the indicator random variable 35.4 Randomization and linear programming 1121 Y i D I fclause i is satisûedg ; so that Y i D 1 as long as at least one of the literals in the i th clause is set to 1. Since no literal appears more than once in the same clause, and since we assume that no variable and its negation appear in the same clause, the settings of the three literals in each clause are independent. A clause is not satisûed only if all three of its literals are set to 0, and so Pr fclause i is not satisûedg D .1=2/ 3 D 1=8. Thus, we have Pr fclause i is satisûedg D 1  1=8 D 7=8, and Lemma 5.1 on page 130 gives E ŒY i � D 7=8. Let Y be the number of satisûed clauses overall, so that Y D Y 1 C Y 2 C    C Y m . Then, we have E ŒY � D E \" m X i D1 Y i # D m X i D1 E ŒY i � (by linearity of expectation) D m X i D1 7=8 D 7m=8 : Since m is an upper bound on the number of satisûed clauses, the approximation ratio is at most m=.7m=8/ D 8=7. Approximating weighted vertex cover using linear programming The minimum-weight vertex-cover problem takes as input an undirected graph G D .V; E/ in which each vertex v 2 V has an associated positive weight w.v/. The weight w.V 0 / of a vertex cover V 0 ෂ V is the sum of the weights of its vertices: w.V 0 / D P v2V 0 w.v/. The goal is to ûnd a vertex cover of minimum weight. The approximation algorithm for unweighted vertex cover from Section 35.1 won’t work here, because the solution it returns could be far from optimal for the weighted problem. Instead, we’ll ûrst compute a lower bound on the weight of the minimum-weight vertex cover, by using a linear program. Then we’ll <round= this solution and use it to obtain a vertex cover. Start by associating a variable x.v/ with each vertex v 2 V , and require that x.v/ equals either 0 or 1 for each v 2 V . The vertex cover includes v if and only if x.v/ D 1. Then the constraint that for any edge .u; v/, at least one of u and v must belong to the vertex cover can be expressed as x.u/ C x.v/  1. This view gives rise to the following 0-1 integer program for ûnding a minimum-weight vertex cover: 1122 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms minimize X v2V w.v/ x.v/ (35.12) subject to x.u/ C x.v/  1 for each .u; v/ 2 E (35.13) x.v/ 2 f0; 1g for each v 2 V : (35.14) In the special case in which all the weights w.v/ equal 1, this formulation is the optimization version of the NP-hard vertex-cover problem. Let’s remove the constraint that x.v/ 2 f0; 1g and replace it by 0 හ x.v/ හ 1, resulting in the following linear program: minimize X v2V w.v/ x.v/ (35.15) subject to x.u/ C x.v/  1 for each .u; v/ 2 E (35.16) x.v/ හ 1 for each v 2 V (35.17) x.v/  0 for each v 2 V : (35.18) We refer to this linear program as the linear-programming relaxation. Any fea- sible solution to the 0-1 integer program in lines (35.12)3(35.14) is also a feasible solution to its linear-programming relaxation in lines (35.15)3(35.18). Therefore, the value of an optimal solution to the linear-programming relaxation provides a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution to the 0-1 integer program, and hence a lower bound on the optimal weight in the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem. The procedure APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT-VC on the facing page starts with a so- lution to the linear-programming relaxation and uses it to construct an approximate solution to the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem. The procedure works as follows. Line 1 initializes the vertex cover to be empty. Line 2 formulates the linear-programming relaxation in lines (35.15)3(35.18) and then solves this linear program. An optimal solution gives each vertex v an associated value N x.v/, where 0 හ N x.v/ හ 1. The procedure uses this value to guide the choice of which vertices to add to the vertex cover C in lines 335: the vertex cover C includes vertex v if and only if N x.v/  1=2. In effect, the procedure <rounds= each fractional variable in the solution to the linear-programming relaxation to either 0 or 1 in order to ob- tain a solution to the 0-1 integer program in lines (35.12)3(35.14). Finally, line 6 returns the vertex cover C . Theorem 35.6 Algorithm APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT-VC is a polynomial-time 2-approximation al- gorithm for the minimum-weight vertex-cover problem. 35.4 Randomization and linear programming 1123 APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT-VC .G; w/ 1 C D ; 2 compute N x, an optimal solution to the linear-programming relaxation in lines (35.15)3(35.18) 3 for each vertex v 2 V 4 if N x.v/  1=2 5 C D C [ fvg 6 return C Proof Because there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the linear program in line 2, and because the for loop of lines 335 runs in polynomial time, APPROX- MIN-WEIGHT-VC is a polynomial-time algorithm. It remains to show that APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT-VC is a 2-approximation algo- rithm. Let C  be an optimal solution to the minimum-weight vertex-cover prob- lem, and let ´  be the value of an optimal solution to the linear-programming relax- ation in lines (35.15)3(35.18). Since an optimal vertex cover is a feasible solution to the linear-programming relaxation, ´  must be a lower bound on w.C  /, that is, ´  හ w.C  / : (35.19) Next, we claim that rounding the fractional values of the variables N x.v/ in lines 335 produces a set C that is a vertex cover and satisûes w.C / හ 2´  . To see that C is a vertex cover, consider any edge .u; v/ 2 E. By constraint (35.16), we know that x.u/ C x.v/  1, which implies that at least one of N x.u/ and N x.v/ is at least 1=2. Therefore, at least one of u and v is included in the vertex cover, and so every edge is covered. Now we consider the weight of the cover. We have ´  D X v2V w.v/ N x.v/  X v2V W N x.v/  1=2 w.v/ N x.v/  X v2V W N x.v/  1=2 w.v/  1 2 D X v2C w.v/  1 2 D 1 2 X v2C w.v/ D 1 2 w.C / : (35.20) 1124 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms Combining inequalities (35.19) and (35.20) gives w.C / හ 2´  හ 2w.C  / ; and hence APPROX-MIN-WEIGHT-VC is a 2-approximation algorithm. Exercises 35.4-1 Show that even if a clause is allowed to contain both a variable and its negation, randomly setting each variable to 1 with probability 1=2 and to 0 with probabil- ity 1=2 still yields a randomized 8=7-approximation algorithm. 35.4-2 The MAX-CNF satisûability problem is like the MAX-3-CNF satisûability prob- lem, except that it does not restrict each clause to have exactly three literals. Give a randomized 2-approximation algorithm for the MAX-CNF satisûability problem. 35.4-3 In the MAX-CUT problem, the input is an unweighted undirected graph G D .V; E/. We deûne a cut .S; V  S/ as in Chapter 21 and the weight of a cut as the number of edges crossing the cut. The goal is to ûnd a cut of maximum weight. Suppose that each vertex v is randomly and independently placed into S with probability 1=2 and into V  S with probability 1=2. Show that this algorithm is a randomized 2-approximation algorithm. 35.4-4 Show that the constraints in line (35.17) are redundant in the sense that remov- ing them from the linear-programming relaxation in lines (35.15)3(35.18) yields a linear program for which any optimal solution x must satisfy x.v/ හ 1 for each v 2 V . 35.5 The subset-sum problem Recall from Section 34.5.5 that an instance of the subset-sum problem is given by a pair .S; t/, where S is a set fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g of positive integers and t is a positive integer. This decision problem asks whether there exists a subset of S that adds up exactly to the target value t . As we saw in Section 34.5.5, this problem is NP-complete. The optimization problem associated with this decision problem arises in prac- tical applications. The optimization problem seeks a subset of fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g 35.5 The subset-sum problem 1125 whose sum is as large as possible but not larger than t . For example, consider a truck that can carry no more than t pounds, which is to be loaded with up to n dif- ferent boxes, the i th of which weighs x i pounds. How heavy a load can the truck take without exceeding the t -pound weight limit? We start this section with an exponential-time algorithm to compute the optimal value for this optimization problem. Then we show how to modify the algorithm so that it becomes a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. (Recall that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme has a running time that is polynomial in 1=� as well as in the size of the input.) An exponential-time exact algorithm Suppose that you compute, for each subset S 0 of S , the sum of the elements in S 0 , and then you select, among the subsets whose sum does not exceed t , the one whose sum is closest to t . This algorithm returns the optimal solution, but it might take exponential time. To implement this algorithm, you can use an iterative procedure that, in iteration i , computes the sums of all subsets of fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x i g, using as a starting point the sums of all subsets of fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x i 1 g. In doing so, you would realize that once a particular subset S 0 has a sum exceeding t , there is no reason to maintain it, since no superset of S 0 can be an optimal solution. Let’s see how to implement this strategy. The procedure EXACT-SUBSET-SUM takes an input set S D fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g, the size n D jS j, and a target value t . This procedure iteratively computes L i , the list of sums of all subsets of fx 1 ; : : : ; x i g that do not exceed t , and then it returns the maximum value in L n . If L is a list of positive integers and x is another positive integer, then let L C x denote the list of integers derived from L by increasing each element of L by x . For example, if L D h1; 2; 3; 5; 9i, then L C 2 D h3; 4; 5; 7; 11i. This notation extends to sets, so that C x D fs C x W s 2 S g : EXACT-SUBSET-SUM.S; n; t/ 1 L 0 D h0i 2 for i D 1 to n 3 L i D MERGE-LISTS .L i 1 ; L i 1 C x i / 4 remove from L i every element that is greater than t 5 return the largest element in L n EXACT-SUBSET-SUM invokes an auxiliary procedure MERGE-LISTS .L; L 0 /, which returns the sorted list that is the merge of its two sorted input lists L and L 0 , 1126 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms with duplicate values removed. Like the MERGE procedure we used in merge sort on page 36, MERGE-LISTS runs in O.jLj C jL 0 j/ time. We omit the pseudocode for MERGE-LISTS. To see how EXACT-SUBSET-SUM works, let P i denote the set of values ob- tained by selecting each (possibly empty) subset of fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x i g and summing its members. For example, if S D f1; 4; 5g, then P 1 D f0; 1g ; P 2 D f0; 1; 4; 5g ; P 3 D f0; 1; 4; 5; 6; 9; 10g : Given the identity P i D P i 1 [ .P i 1 C x i / ; (35.21) you can prove by induction on i (see Exercise 35.5-1) that the list L i is a sorted list containing every element of P i whose value is not more than t . Since the length of L i can be as much as 2 i , EXACT-SUBSET-SUM is an exponential-time algorithm in general, although it is a polynomial-time algorithm in the special cases in which t is polynomial in jS j or all the numbers in S are bounded by a polynomial in jS j. A fully polynomial-time approximation scheme The key to devising a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the subset- sum problem is to <trim= each list L i after it is created. Here’s the idea behind trimming: if two values in L are close to each other, then since the goal is just an approximate solution, there is no need to maintain both of them explicitly. More precisely, use a trimming parameter ı such that 0 < ı < 1. When trimming a list L by ı , remove as many elements from L as possible, in such a way that if L 0 is the result of trimming L, then for every element y that was removed from L, some element ´ still in L 0 approximates y . For ´ to approximate y , it must be no greater than y and also within a factor of 1 C ı of y , so that y 1 C ı හ ´ හ y : (35.22) You can think of such a ´ as <representing= y in the new list L 0 . Each removed element y is represented by a remaining element ´ satisfying inequality (35.22). For example, suppose that ı D 0:1 and L D h10; 11; 12; 15; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 29i : Then trimming L results in L 0 D h10; 12; 15; 20; 23; 29i ; 35.5 The subset-sum problem 1127 where the deleted value 11 is represented by 10, the deleted values 21 and 22 are represented by 20, and the deleted value 24 is represented by 23. Because every element of the trimmed version of the list is also an element of the original version of the list, trimming can dramatically decrease the number of elements kept while keeping a close (and slightly smaller) representative value in the list for each deleted element. The procedure TRIM trims list L D hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y m i in ‚.m/ time, given L and the trimming parameter ı . It assumes that L is sorted into monotonically increasing order. The output of the procedure is a trimmed, sorted list. The procedure scans the elements of L in monotonically increasing order. A number is appended onto the returned list L 0 only if it is the ûrst element of L or if it cannot be represented by the most recent number placed into L 0 . TRIM.L; ı/ 1 let m be the length of L 2 L 0 D hy 1 i 3 last D y 1 4 for i D 2 to m 5 if y i > last  .1 C ı/ // y i  last because L is sorted 6 append y i onto the end of L 0 7 last D y i 8 return L 0 Given the procedure TRIM, the procedure APPROX-SUBSET-SUM on the fol- lowing page implements the approximation scheme. This procedure takes as input a set S D fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n g of n integers (in arbitrary order), the size n D jS j, the target integer t , and an approximation parameter � , where 0 < � < 1 : (35.23) It returns a value ´  whose value is within a factor of 1 C � of the optimal solution. The APPROX-SUBSET-SUM procedure works as follows. Line 1 initializes the list L 0 to be the list containing just the element 0. The for loop in lines 235 com- putes L i as a sorted list containing a suitably trimmed version of the set P i , with all elements larger than t removed. Since the procedure creates L i from L i 1 , it must ensure that the repeated trimming doesn’t introduce too much compounded inaccuracy. That’s why instead of the trimming parameter being � in the call to TRIM, it has the smaller value �=2n. We’ll soon see that APPROX-SUBSET-SUM returns a correct approximation if one exists. 1128 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms APPROX-SUBSET-SUM .S; n; t; �/ 1 L 0 D h0i 2 for i D 1 to n 3 L i D MERGE-LISTS .L i 1 ; L i 1 C x i / 4 L i D TRIM.L i ; �=2n/ 5 remove from L i every element that is greater than t 6 let ´  be the largest value in L n 7 return ´  As an example, suppose that A PPROX-SUBSET-SUM is given S D h104; 102; 201; 101i with t D 308 and � D 0:40. The trimming parameter ı is �=2n D 0:40=8 D 0:05. The procedure computes the following values on the indicated lines: line 1: L 0 D h0i ; line 3: L 1 D h0; 104i ; line 4: L 1 D h0; 104i ; line 5: L 1 D h0; 104i ; line 3: L 2 D h0; 102; 104; 206i ; line 4: L 2 D h0; 102; 206i ; line 5: L 2 D h0; 102; 206i ; line 3: L 3 D h0; 102; 201; 206; 303; 407i ; line 4: L 3 D h0; 102; 201; 303; 407i ; line 5: L 3 D h0; 102; 201; 303i ; line 3: L 4 D h0; 101; 102; 201; 203; 302; 303; 404i ; line 4: L 4 D h0; 101; 201; 302; 404i ; line 5: L 4 D h0; 101; 201; 302i : The procedure returns ´  D 302 as its answer, which is well within � D 40% of the optimal answer 307 D 104 C 102 C 101. In fact, it is within 2%. Theorem 35.7 APPROX-SUBSET-SUM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the subset-sum problem. 35.5 The subset-sum problem 1129 Proof The operations of trimming L i in line 4 and removing from L i every ele- ment that is greater than t maintain the property that every element of L i is also a member of P i . Therefore, the value ´  returned in line 7 is indeed the sum of some subset of S , that is, ´  2 P n . Let y  2 P n denote an optimal solution to the subset- sum problem, so that it is the greatest value in P n that is less than or equal to t . Because line 5 ensures that ´  හ t , we know that ´  හ y  . By inequality (35.1), we need to show that y  =´  හ 1 C � . We must also show that the running time of this algorithm is polynomial in both 1=� and the size of the input. As Exercise 35.5-2 asks you to show, for every element y in P i that is at most t , there exists an element ´ 2 L i such that y .1 C �=2n/ i හ ´ හ y : (35.24) Inequality (35.24) must hold for y  2 P n , and therefore there exists an element ´ 2 L n such that y  .1 C �=2n/ n හ ´ හ y  ; and thus y  ´ හ  1 C � 2n Í n : (35.25) Since there exists an element ´ 2 L n fulûlling inequality (35.25), the inequality must hold for ´  , which is the largest value in L n , which is to say y  ´  හ  1 C � 2n Í n : (35.26) Now we show that y  =´  හ 1C� . We do so by showing that .1C�=2n/ n හ 1C� . First, inequality (35.23), 0 < � < 1, implies that .�=2/ 2 හ �=2 : (35.27) Next, from equation (3.16) on page 66, we have lim n!1 .1 C �=2n/ n D e =2 . Exercise 35.5-3 asks you to show that d d n  1 C � 2n Í n > 0 : (35.28) Therefore, the function .1 C �=2n/ n increases with n as it approaches its limit of e =2 , and we have  1 C � 2n Í n හ e =2 හ 1 C �=2 C .�=2/ 2 (by inequality (3.15) on page 66) හ 1 C � (by inequality (35.27)) . (35.29) 1130 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms Combining inequalities (35.26) and (35.29) completes the analysis of the approxi- mation ratio. To show that APPROX-SUBSET-SUM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, we derive a bound on the length of L i . After trimming, successive ele- ments ´ and ´ 0 of L i must have the relationship ´ 0 =´ > 1C�=2n. That is, they must differ by a factor of at least 1 C �=2n. Each list, therefore, contains the value 0, possibly the value 1, and up to blog 1C=2n t c additional values. The number of elements in each list L i is at most log 1C=2n t C 2 D ln t ln.1 C �=2n/ C 2 හ 2n.1 C �=2n/ ln t � C 2 (by inequality (3.23) on page 67) < 3n ln t � C 2 (by inequality (35.23), 0 < � < 1) . This bound is polynomial in the size of the input4which is the number of bits lg t needed to represent t plus the number of bits needed to represent the set S , which in turn is polynomial in n4and in 1=� . Since the running time of APPROX-SUBSET- SUM is polynomial in the lengths of the lists L i , we conclude that APPROX- SUBSET-SUM is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. Exercises 35.5-1 Prove equation (35.21). Then show that after executing line 4 of E XACT-SUBSET- SUM, L i is a sorted list containing every element of P i whose value is not more than t . 35.5-2 Using induction on i , prove inequality (35.24). 35.5-3 Prove inequality (35.28). 35.5-4 How can you modify the approximation scheme presented in this section to ûnd a good approximation to the smallest value not less than t that is a sum of some subset of the given input list? 35.5-5 Modify the APPROX-SUBSET-SUM procedure to also return the subset of S that sums to the value ´  . Problems for Chapter 35 1131 Problems 35-1 Bin packing You are given a set of n objects, where the size s i of the i th object satisûes 0 < s i < 1. Your goal is to pack all the objects into the minimum number of unit- size bins. Each bin can hold any subset of the objects whose total size does not exceed 1. a. Prove that the problem of determining the minimum number of bins required is NP-hard. (Hint: Reduce from the subset-sum problem.) The ûrst-ût heuristic takes each object in turn and places it into the ûrst bin that can accommodate it, as follows. It maintains an ordered list of bins. Let b denote the number of bins in the list, where b increases over the course of the algorithm, and let hB 1 ; : : : ; B b i be the list of bins. Initially b D 0 and the list is empty. The algorithm takes each object i in turn and places it in the lowest-numbered bin that can still accommodate it. If no bin can accommodate object i , then b is incremented and a new bin B b is opened, containing object i . Let S D P n i D1 s i . b.

Argue that if there is an approximation algorithm that has a constant approxi- mation ratio for ûnding a maximum-size clique, then there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem. 1132 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms 35-3 Weighted set-covering problem Suppose that sets have weights in the set-covering problem, so that each set S i in the family F has an associated weight w i . The weight of a cover C is P S i 2C w i . The goal is wish to determine a minimum-weight cover. (Section 35.3 handles the case in which w i D 1 for all i .) Show how to generalize the greedy set-covering heuristic in a natural manner to provide an approximate solution for any instance of the weighted set-covering problem. Letting d be the maximum size of any set S i , show that your heuristic has an approximation ratio of H.d / D P d i D1 1=i . 35-4 Maximum matching Recall that for an undirected graph G, a matching is a set of edges such that no two edges in the set are incident on the same vertex. Section 25.1 showed how to ûnd a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, that is, a matching such that no other matching in G contains more edges. This problem examines matchings in undirected graphs that are not required to be bipartite. a. Show that a maximal matching need not be a maximum matching by exhibiting an undirected graph G and a maximal matching M in G that is not a maximum matching.

Problems for Chapter 35 1133 35-5 Parallel machine scheduling In the parallel-machine-scheduling problem, the input has two parts: n jobs, J 1 ; J 2 ; : : : ; J n , where each job J k has an associated nonnegative processing time of p k , and m identical machines, M 1 ; M 2 ; : : : ; M m . Any job can run on any ma- chine. A schedule speciûes, for each job J k , the machine on which it runs and the time period during which it runs. Each job J k must run on some machine M i for p k consecutive time units, and during that time period no other job may run on M i . Let C k denote the completion time of job J k , that is, the time at which job J k completes processing. Given a schedule, deûne C max D max fC j W 1 හ j හ ng to be the makespan of the schedule. The goal is to ûnd a schedule whose makespan is minimum. For example, consider an input with two machines M 1 and M 2 , and four jobs J 1 , J 2 , J 3 , and J 4 with p 1 D 2, p 2 D 12, p 3 D 4, and p 4 D 5. Then one possible schedule runs, on machine M 1 , job J 1 followed by job J 2 , and on machine M 2 , job J 4 followed by job J 3 . For this schedule, C 1 D 2, C 2 D 14, C 3 D 9, C 4 D 5, and C max D 14. An optimal schedule runs job J 2 on machine M 1 and jobs J 1 , J 3 , and J 4 on machine M 2 . For this schedule, we have C 1 D 2, C 2 D 12, C 3 D 6, and C 4 D 11, and so C max D 12.

The input includes n items, where the i th item is worth v i dollars and weighs w i pounds. The input also includes the capacity of a knapsack, which is W pounds. Here, we add the further assumptions that each weight w i is at most W and that the items are indexed in monotonically decreasing order of their values: v 1  v 2      v n . In the 0-1 knapsack problem, the goal is to ûnd a subset of the items whose total weight is at most W and whose total value is maximum. The fractional knapsack problem is like the 0-1 knapsack problem, except that a fraction of each item may be put into the knapsack, rather than either all or none of each item. If a fraction x i of item i goes into the knapsack, where 0 හ x i හ 1, it contributes x i w i to the weight of the knapsack and adds value x i v i . The goal of this problem is to develop a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem. In order to design a polynomial-time algorithm, let’s consider restricted in- stances of the 0-1 knapsack problem. Given an instance I of the knapsack problem, form restricted instances I j , for j D 1; 2; : : : ; n, by removing items 1; 2; : : : ; j  1 and requiring the solution to include item j (all of item j in both the fractional and 0-1 knapsack problems). No items are removed in instance I 1 . For instance I j , let P j denote an optimal solution to the 0-1 problem and Q j denote an optimal solution to the fractional problem. a. Argue that an optimal solution to instance I of the 0-1 knapsack problem is one of fP 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P n g. Notes for Chapter 35 1135 b. Prove that to ûnd an optimal solution Q j to the fractional problem for in- stance I j , you can include item j and then use the greedy algorithm in which each step takes as much as possible of the unchosen item with the maximum value per pound v i =w i in the set fj C 1; j C 2; : : : ; ng. c. Prove that there is always an optimal solution Q j to the fractional problem for instance I j that includes at most one item fractionally. That is, for all items except possibly one, either all of the item or none of the item goes into the knapsack. d. Given an optimal solution Q j to the fractional problem for instance I j , form solution R j from Q j by deleting any fractional items from Q j . Let v.S/ denote the total value of items taken in a solution S . Prove that v.R j /  v.Q j /=2  v.P j /=2. e. Give a polynomial-time algorithm that returns a maximum-value solution from the set fR 1 ; R 2 ; : : : ; R n g, and prove that your algorithm is a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem. Chapter notes Although methods that do not necessarily compute exact solutions have been known for thousands of years (for example, methods to approximate the value of � ), the notion of an approximation algorithm is much more recent. Hochbaum [221] credits Garey, Graham, and Ullman [175] and Johnson [236] with formal- izing the concept of a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. The ûrst such algorithm is often credited to Graham [197]. Since this early work, thousands of approximation algorithms have been de- signed for a wide range of problems, and there is a wealth of literature on this ûeld. Texts by Ausiello et al. [29], Hochbaum [221], Vazirani [446], and Williamson and Shmoys [459] deal exclusively with approximation algorithms, as do surveys by Shmoys [409] and Klein and Young [256]. Several other texts, such as Garey and Johnson [176] and Papadimitriou and Steiglitz [353], have signiûcant coverage of approximation algorithms as well. Books edited by Lawler, Lenstra, Rinnooy Kan, and Shmoys [277] and by Gutin and Punnen [204] provide extensive treatments of approximation algorithms and heuristics for the traveling-salesperson problem. Papadimitriou and Steiglitz attribute the algorithm APPROX-VERTEX-COVER to F. Gavril and M. Yannakakis. The vertex-cover problem has been studied exten- sively (Hochbaum [221] lists 16 different approximation algorithms for this prob- lem), but all the approximation ratios are at least 2  o.1/. 1136 Chapter 35 Approximation Algorithms The algorithm APPROX-TSP-TOUR appears in a paper by Rosenkrantz, Stearns, and Lewis [384]. Christoûdes improved on this algorithm and gave a 3=2-approxi- mation algorithm for the traveling-salesperson problem with the triangle inequality. Arora [23] and Mitchell [330] have shown that if the points lie in the euclidean plane, there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme. Theorem 35.3 is due to Sahni and Gonzalez [392]. The algorithm APPROX-SUBSET-SUM and its analysis are loosely modeled after related approximation algorithms for the knapsack and subset-sum problems by Ibarra and Kim [234]. Problem 35-7 is a combinatorial version of a more general result on approximat- ing knapsack-type integer programs by Bienstock and McClosky [55]. The randomized algorithm for MAX-3-CNF satisûability is implicit in the work of Johnson [236]. The weighted vertex-cover algorithm is by Hochbaum [220]. Section 35.4 only touches on the power of randomization and linear programming in the design of approximation algorithms. A combination of these two ideas yields a technique called <randomized rounding,= which formulates a problem as an in- teger linear program, solves the linear-programming relaxation, and interprets the variables in the solution as probabilities. These probabilities then help guide the solution of the original problem. This technique was ûrst used by Raghavan and Thompson [374], and it has had many subsequent uses. (See Motwani, Naor, and Raghavan [335] for a survey.) Several other notable ideas in the ûeld of approxi- mation algorithms include the primal-dual method (see Goemans and Williamson [184] for a survey), ûnding sparse cuts for use in divide-and-conquer algorithms [288], and the use of semideûnite programming [183]. As mentioned in the chapter notes for Chapter 34, results in probabilistically checkable proofs have led to lower bounds on the approximability of many prob- lems, including several in this chapter. In addition to the references there, the chapter by Arora and Lund [26] contains a good description of the relationship between probabilistically checkable proofs and the hardness of approximating var- ious problems. Part VIII Appendix: Mathematical Background Introduction When you analyze algorithms, you often need to draw upon a body of mathematical tools. Some of these tools are as simple as high-school algebra, but others may be new to you. In Part I, we saw how to manipulate asymptotic notations and solve recurrences. This appendix comprises a compendium of several other concepts and methods used in analyzing algorithms. As noted in the introduction to Part I, you may have seen much of the material in this appendix before having read this book, although some of the speciûc notational conventions appearing here might differ from those you have seen elsewhere. Hence, you should treat this appendix as reference material. As in the rest of this book, however, we have included exercises and problems, in order for you to improve your skills in these areas. Appendix A offers methods for evaluating and bounding summations, which occur frequently in the analysis of algorithms. Many of the formulas here appear in any calculus text, but you will ûnd it convenient to have these methods compiled in one place. Appendix B contains basic deûnitions and notations for sets, relations, functions, graphs, and trees. It also gives some basic properties of these mathematical objects. Appendix C begins with elementary principles of counting: permutations, com- binations, and the like. The remainder contains deûnitions and properties of basic probability. Most of the algorithms in this book require no probability for their analysis, and thus you can easily omit the latter sections of the chapter on a ûrst reading, even without skimming them. Later, when you encounter a probabilistic analysis that you want to understand better, you will ûnd Appendix C well orga- nized for reference purposes. Appendix D deûnes matrices, their operations, and some of their basic prop- erties. You have probably seen most of this material already if you have taken a course in linear algebra. But you might ûnd it helpful to have one place to look for notations and deûnitions. A Summations When an algorithm contains an iterative control construct such as a while or for loop, you can express its running time as the sum of the times spent on each execu- tion of the body of the loop. For example, Section 2.2 argued that the i th iteration of insertion sort took time proportional to i in the worst case. Adding up the time spent on each iteration produced the summation (or series) P n i D2 i . Evaluating this summation resulted in a bound of ‚.n 2 / on the worst-case running time of the algorithm. This example illustrates why you should know how to manipulate and bound summations. Section A.1 lists several basic formulas involving summations. Section A.2 of- fers useful techniques for bounding summations. The formulas in Section A.1 appear without proof, though proofs for some of them appear in Section A.2 to illustrate the methods of that section. You can ûnd most of the other proofs in any calculus text. A.1 Summation formulas and properties Given a sequence a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n of numbers, where n is a nonnegative integer, the ûnite sum a 1 C a 2 C    C a n can be expressed as P n kD1 a k . If n D 0, the value of the summation is deûned to be 0. The value of a ûnite series is always well deûned, and the order in which its terms are added does not matter. Given an inûnite sequence a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : of numbers, we can write their inûnite sum a 1 C a 2 C    as P 1 kD1 a k , which means lim n!1 P n kD1 a k . If the limit does not exist, the series diverges, and otherwise, it converges. The terms of a convergent series cannot always be added in any order. You can, however, rearrange the terms of an absolutely convergent series, that is, a series P 1 kD1 a k for which the series P 1 kD1 ja k j also converges. A.1 Summation formulas and properties 1141 Linearity For any real number c and any ûnite sequences a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n and b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n , n X kD1 .ca k C b k / D c n X kD1 a k C n X kD1 b k : The linearity property also applies to inûnite convergent series. The linearity property applies to summations incorporating asymptotic notation. For example, n X kD1 ‚.f .k// D ‚  n X kD1 f .k/ ! : In this equation, the ‚-notation on the left-hand side applies to the variable k, but on the right-hand side, it applies to n. Such manipulations also apply to inûnite convergent series. Arithmetic series The summation n X kD1 k D 1 C 2 C    C n ; is an arithmetic series and has the value n X kD1 k D n.n C 1/ 2 (A.1) D ‚.n 2 / : (A.2) A general arithmetic series includes an additive constant a  0 and a constant coefûcient b > 0 in each term, but has the same total asymptotically: n X kD1 .a C bk/ D ‚.n 2 / : (A.3) Sums of squares and cubes The following formulas apply to summations of squares and cubes: n X kD0 k 2 D n.n C 1/.2n C 1/ 6 ; (A.4) n X kD0 k 3 D n 2 .n C 1/ 2 4 : (A.5) 1142 Appendix A Summations Geometric series For real x ¤ 1, the summation n X kD0 x k D 1 C x C x 2 C    C x n is a geometric series and has the value n X kD0 x k D x nC1  1 x  1 : (A.6) The inûnite decreasing geometric series occurs when the summation is inûnite and jx j < 1: 1 X kD0 x k D 1 1  x : (A.7) If we assume that 0 0 D 1, these formulas apply even when x D 0. Harmonic series For positive integers n, the nth harmonic number is H n D 1 C 1 2 C 1 3 C 1 4 C    C 1 n D n X kD1 1 k (A.8) D ln n C O.1/ : (A.9) Inequalities (A.20) and (A.21) on page 1150 provide the stronger bounds ln.n C 1/ හ H n හ ln n C 1 : (A.10) Integrating and differentiating series Integrating or differentiating the formulas above yields additional formulas. For example, differentiating both sides of the inûnite geometric series (A.7) and mul- tiplying by x gives 1 X kD0 kx k D x .1  x/ 2 (A.11) for jx j < 1. A.1 Summation formulas and properties 1143 Telescoping series For any sequence a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n , n X kD1 .a k  a k1 / D a n  a 0 ; (A.12) since each of the terms a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n1 is added in exactly once and subtracted out exactly once. We say that the sum telescopes. Similarly, n1 X kD0 .a k  a kC1 / D a 0  a n : As an example of a telescoping sum, consider the series n1 X kD1 1 k.k C 1/ : Rewriting each term as 1 k.k C 1/ D 1 k  1 k C 1 ; gives n1 X kD1 1 k.k C 1/ D n1 X kD1 Î 1 k  1 k C 1 Ï D 1  1 n : Reindexing summations A series can sometimes be simpliûed by changing its index, often reversing the order of summation. Consider the series P n kD0 a nk . Because the terms in this summation are a n ; a n1 ; : : : ; a 0 , we can reverse the order of indices by letting j D n  k and rewrite this summation as n X kD0 a nk D n X j D0 a j : (A.13) Generally, if the summation index appears in the body of the sum with a minus sign, it’s worth thinking about reindexing. As an example, consider the summation 1144 Appendix A Summations n X kD1 1 n  k C 1 : The index k appears with a negative sign in 1=.n  k C 1/. And indeed, we can simplify this summation, this time setting j D n  k C 1, yielding n X kD1 1 n  k C 1 D n X j D1 1 j ; (A.14) which is just the harmonic series (A.8). Products The ûnite product a 1 a 2    a n can be expressed as n Y kD1 a k : If n D 0, the value of the product is deûned to be 1. You can convert a formula with a product to a formula with a summation by using the identity lg  n Y kD1 a k ! D n X kD1 lg a k : Exercises A.1-1 Prove that P n kD1 O.f k .i // D O ã P n kD1 f k .i / ä by using the linearity property of summations. A.1-2 Find a simple formula for P n kD1 .2k  1/.

A.1-10 Evaluate the sum P 1 kD1 .2k C 1/x 2k for jx j < 1. ? A.1-11 Evaluate the product Q n kD2 .1  1=k 2 /. A.2 Bounding summations You can choose from several techniques to bound the summations that describe the running times of algorithms. Here are some of the most frequently used methods. Mathematical induction The most basic way to evaluate a series is to use mathematical induction. As an example, let’s prove that the arithmetic series P n kD1 k evaluates to n.n C 1/=2. For n D 1, we have that n.n C 1/=2 D 1  2=2 D 1, which equals P 1 kD1 k. With the inductive assumption that it holds for n, we prove that it holds for n C 1. We have nC1 X kD1 k D n X kD1 k C .n C 1/ D n.n C 1/ 2 C .n C 1/ D n 2 C n C 2n C 2 2 D .n C 1/.n C 2/ 2 : You don’t always need to guess the exact value of a summation in order to use mathematical induction. Instead, you can use induction to prove an upper or lower 1146 Appendix A Summations bound on a summation. As an example, let’s prove the asymptotic upper bound P n kD0 3 k D O.3 n /. More speciûcally, we’ll prove that P n kD0 3 k හ c3 n for some constant c . For the initial condition n D 0, we have P 0 kD0 3 k D 1 හ c  1 as long as c  1. Assuming that the bound holds for n, we prove that it holds for n C 1. We have nC1 X kD0 3 k D n X kD0 3 k C 3 nC1 හ c3 n C 3 nC1 (by the inductive hypothesis) D Î 1 3 C 1 c Ï c3 nC1 හ c3 nC1 as long as .1=3 C 1=c/ හ 1 or, equivalently, c  3=2. Thus, P n kD0 3 k D O.3 n /, as we wished to show. You need to take care when using asymptotic notation to prove bounds by in- duction. Consider the following fallacious proof that P n kD1 k D O.n/. Certainly, P 1 kD1 k D O.1/. Assuming that the bound holds for n, we now prove it for n C 1: nC1 X kD1 k D n X kD1 k C .n C 1/ D O.n/ C .n C 1/ Ń wrong! D O.n C 1/ : The bug in the argument is that the <constant= hidden by the <big-oh= grows with n and thus is not constant. We have not shown that the same constant works for all n. Bounding the terms You can sometimes obtain a good upper bound on a series by bounding each term of the series, and it often sufûces to use the largest term to bound the others. For example, a quick upper bound on the arithmetic series (A.1) is n X kD1 k හ n X kD1 n D n 2 : In general, for a series P n kD1 a k , if we let a max D max fa k W 1 හ k හ ng, then n X kD1 a k හ n  a max : A.2 Bounding summations 1147 The technique of bounding each term in a series by the largest term is a weak method when the series can in fact be bounded by a geometric series. Given the series P n kD0 a k , suppose that a kC1 =a k හ r for all k  0, where 0 < r < 1 is a constant. You can bound the sum by an inûnite decreasing geometric series, since a k හ a 0 r k , and thus n X kD0 a k හ 1 X kD0 a 0 r k D a 0 1 X kD0 r k (A.15) D a 0 1 1  r : (A.16) You can apply this method to bound the summation P 1 kD1 .k=3 k /. In order to start the summation at k D 0, rewrite it as P 1 kD0 ..k C1/=3 kC1 /. The ûrst term (a 0 ) is 1=3, and the ratio (r ) of consecutive terms is .k C 2/=3 kC2 .k C 1/=3 kC1 D 1 3  k C 2 k C 1 හ 2 3 for all k  0. Thus, we have 1 X kD1 k 3 k D 1 X kD0 k C 1 3 kC1 හ 1 3  1 1  2=3 D 1 : A common bug in applying this method is to show that the ratio of consecu- tive terms is less than 1 and then to assume that the summation is bounded by a geometric series. An example is the inûnite harmonic series, which diverges since 1 X kD1 1 k D lim n!1 n X kD1 1 k D lim n!1 ‚.lg n/ D 1 : The ratio of the .k C1/st and kth terms in this series is k=.k C1/ < 1, but the series is not bounded by a decreasing geometric series. To bound a series by a geometric 1148 Appendix A Summations series, you need to show that there is an r < 1, which is a constant, such that the ratio of all pairs of consecutive terms never exceeds r . In the harmonic series, no such r exists because the ratio becomes arbitrarily close to 1. Splitting summations One way to obtain bounds on a difûcult summation is to express the series as the sum of two or more series by partitioning the range of the index and then to bound each of the resulting series. For example, let’s ûnd a lower bound on the arithmetic series P n kD1 k, which we have already seen has an upper bound of n 2 . You might attempt to bound each term in the summation by the smallest term, but since that term is 1, you would get a lower bound of n for the summation4far off from the upper bound of n 2 . You can obtain a better lower bound by ûrst splitting the summation. Assume for convenience that n is even, so that n X kD1 k D n=2 X kD1 k C n X kDn=2C1 k  n=2 X kD1 0 C n X kDn=2C1 n 2 D  n 2 Í 2 D �.n 2 / ; which is an asymptotically tight bound, since P n kD1 k D O.n 2 /. For a summation arising from the analysis of an algorithm, you can sometimes split the summation and ignore a constant number of the initial terms. Generally, this technique applies when each term a k in a summation P n kD0 a k is independent of n. Then for any constant k 0 > 0, you can write n X kD0 a k D k 0 1 X kD0 a k C n X kDk 0 a k D ‚.1/ C n X kDk 0 a k ; since the initial terms of the summation are all constant and there are a constant number of them. You can then use other methods to bound P n kDk 0 a k . This tech- nique applies to inûnite summations as well. For example, let’s ûnd an asymptotic upper bound on P 1 kD0 k 2 =2 k . The ratio of consecutive terms is A.2 Bounding summations 1149 .k C 1/ 2 =2 kC1 k 2 =2 k D .k C 1/ 2 2k 2 හ 8=9 if k  3. Thus, you can split the summation into 1 X kD0 k 2 2 k D 2 X kD0 k 2 2 k C 1 X kD3 k 2 2 k D 2 X kD0 k 2 2 k C 1 X kD0 .k C 3/ 2 2 kC3 (by reindexing) හ 2 X kD0 k 2 2 k C 9 8 1 X kD0 Î 8 9 Ï k (by inequality (A.15)) D .0 C 1=2 C 1/ C 9=8 1  8=9 (by equation (A.16)) D O.1/ : The technique of splitting summations can help determine asymptotic bounds in much more difûcult situations. For example, here is one way to obtain a bound of O.lg n/ on the harmonic series (A.9): H n D n X kD1 1 k : The idea is to split the range 1 to n into blg nc C 1 pieces and upper-bound the contribution of each piece by 1. For i D 0; 1; : : : ; blg nc, the i th piece consists of the terms starting at 1=2 i and going up to but not including 1=2 i C1 . The last piece might contain terms not in the original harmonic series, giving n X kD1 1 k හ blg nc X i D0 2 i 1 X j D0 1 2 i C j හ blg nc X i D0 2 i 1 X j D0 1 2 i D blg nc X i D0 Î 2 i  1 2 i Ï D blg nc X i D0 1 හ lg n C 1 : (A.17) 1150 Appendix A Summations Approximation by integrals When a summation has the form P n kDm f .k/, where f .k/ is a monotonically in- creasing function, you can approximate it by integrals: Z n m1 f .x/ dx හ n X kDm f .k/ හ Z nC1 m f .x/ dx : (A.18) Figure A.1 justiûes this approximation.

Appendix notes Knuth [259] provides an excellent reference for the material presented here. You can ûnd basic properties of series in any good calculus book, such as Apostol [19] or Thomas et al. [433]. B Sets, Etc. Many chapters of this book touch on the elements of discrete mathematics. This appendix reviews the notations, deûnitions, and elementary properties of sets, re- lations, functions, graphs, and trees. If you are already well versed in this material, you can probably just skim this chapter. B.1 Sets A set is a collection of distinguishable objects, called its members or elements. If an object x is a member of a set S , we write x 2 S (read <x is a member of S = or, more brieüy, <x belongs to S =). If x is not a member of S , we write x … S . To describe a set explicitly, write its members as a list inside braces. For example, to deûne a set S to contain precisely the numbers 1, 2, and 3, write S D f1; 2; 3g. Since 2 belongs to the set S , we can write 2 2 S , and since 4 is not a member, we can write 4 … S . A set cannot contain the same object more than once, 1 and its elements are not ordered. Two sets A and B are equal, written A D B , if they contain the same elements. For example, f1; 2; 3; 1g D f1; 2; 3g D f3; 2; 1g. We adopt special notations for frequently encountered sets:  ; denotes the empty set, that is, the set containing no members.  Z denotes the set of integers, that is, the set f: : : ; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; : : : g.  R denotes the set of real numbers.  N denotes the set of natural numbers, that is, the set f0; 1; 2; : : :g. 2 1 A variation of a set, which can contain the same object more than once, is called a multiset. 2 Some authors start the natural numbers with 1 instead of 0. The modern trend seems to be to start with 0. 1154 Appendix B Sets, Etc. If all the elements of a set A are contained in a set B , that is, if x 2 A implies x 2 B , then we write A ෂ B and say that A is a subset of B . A set A is a proper subset of set B , written A  B , if A ෂ B but A ¤ B . (Some authors use the symbol <= to denote the ordinary subset relation, rather than the proper-subset relation.) Every set is a subset of itself: A ෂ A for any set A. For two sets A and B , we have A D B if and only if A ෂ B and B ෂ A. The subset relation is transitive (see page 1159): for any three sets A, B , and C , if A ෂ B and B ෂ C , then A ෂ C . The proper-subset relation is transitive as well. The empty set is a subset of all sets: for any set A, we have ; ෂ A. Sets can be speciûed in terms of other sets. Given a set A, a set B ෂ A can be deûned by stating a property that distinguishes the elements of B . For example, one way to deûne the set of even integers is fx W x 2 Z and x=2 is an integerg. The colon in this notation is read <such that.= (Some authors use a vertical bar in place of the colon.) Given two sets A and B , set operations deûne new sets:  The intersection of sets A and B is the set A \\ B D fx W x 2 A and x 2 B g :  The union of sets A and B is the set A [ B D fx W x 2 A or x 2 B g :  The difference between two sets A and B is the set A  B D fx W x 2 A and x … B g : Set operations obey the following laws: Empty set laws: A \\ ; D ; ; A [ ; D A : Idempotency laws: A \\ A D A ; A [ A D A : Commutative laws: A \\ B D B \\ A ; A [ B D B [ A : B.1 Sets 1155 A A A A A A B B B B B   .B \\ C / [ [ D D D D A  .B \\ C / .A  B/ .A  C / C C C C C Figure B.1 A Venn diagram illustrating the ûrst of DeMorgan’s laws (B.2).

Often, all the sets under consideration are subsets of some larger set U called the universe. For example, when considering various sets made up only of integers, the set Z of integers is an appropriate universe. Given a universe U , we deûne the complement of a set A as A D U  A D fx W x 2 U and x … Ag. For any set A ෂ U , we have the following laws: A D A ; A \\ A D ; ; A [ A D U : 1156 Appendix B Sets, Etc. An equivalent way to express DeMorgan’s laws (B.2) uses set complements. For any two sets B; C ෂ U , we have B \\ C D B [ C ; B [ C D B \\ C : Two sets A and B are disjoint if they have no elements in common, that is, if A \\ B D ;. A collection of sets S 1 ; S 2 ; : : :, either ûnite or inûnite, is a set of sets, in which each member is a set S i . A collection S D fS i g of nonempty sets forms a partition of a set S if  the sets are pairwise disjoint, that is, S i ; S j 2 S and i ¤ j imply S i \\ S j D ;, and  their union is S , that is, S D [ S i 2S S i : In other words, S forms a partition of S if each element of S appears in exactly one set S i 2 S . The number of elements in a set is the cardinality (or size) of the set, denoted jS j. Two sets have the same cardinality if their elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence. The cardinality of the empty set is j;j D 0. If the cardinality of a set is a natural number, the set is ûnite, and otherwise, it is inûnite. An inûnite set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers N is countably inûnite, and otherwise, it is uncountable. For example, the integers Z are countable, but the reals R are uncountable. For any two ûnite sets A and B , we have the identity jA [ B j D jAj C jB j  jA \\ B j ; (B.3) from which we can conclude that A [ B j හ jAj C jB j : If A and B are disjoint, then jA \\ B j D 0 and thus jA [ B j D jAj C jB j. If A ෂ B , then jAj හ jB j. A ûnite set of n elements is sometimes called an n-set. A 1-set is called a singleton. A subset of k elements of a set is sometimes called a k-subset. We denote the set of all subsets of a set S , including the empty set and S itself, by 2 S , called the power set of S . For example, 2 fa;bg D f;; fag ; fbg ; fa; bgg. The power set of a ûnite set S has cardinality 2 jSj (see Exercise B.1-5). We sometimes care about setlike structures in which the elements are ordered. An ordered pair of two elements a and b is denoted .a; b/ and is deûned formally B.1 Sets 1157 as the set .a; b/ D fa; fa; bgg. Thus, the ordered pair .a; b/ is not the same as the ordered pair .b; a/. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B , denoted A  B , is the set of all ordered pairs such that the ûrst element of the pair is an element of A and the second is an element of B . More formally, A  B D f.a; b/ W a 2 A and b 2 B g : For example, fa; bgfa; b; c g D f.a; a/; .a; b/; .a; c/; .b; a/; .b; b/; .b; c/g. When A and B are ûnite sets, the cardinality of their Cartesian product is jA  B j D jAj  jB j : (B.4) The Cartesian product of n sets A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n is the set of n-tuples A 1  A 2      A n D f.a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n / W a i 2 A i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; ng ; whose cardinality is A 1  A 2      A n j D jA 1 j  jA 2 j    jA n j if all sets A i are ûnite. We denote an n-fold Cartesian product over a single set A by the set n D A  A      A › n times ; whose cardinality is jA n j D jAj n if A is ûnite. We can also view an n-tuple as a ûnite sequence of length n (see page 1162). Intervals are continuous sets of real numbers. We denote them with parenthe- ses and/or brackets. Given real numbers a and b, the closed interval Œa; b� is the set fx 2 R W a හ x හ bg of reals between a and b, including both a and b. (If a > b, this deûnition implies that Œa; b� D ;.) The open interval .a; b/ D fx 2 R W a < x < bg omits both of the endpoints from the set. There are two half- open intervals Œa; b/ D fx 2 R W a හ x < bg and .a; b� D fx 2 R W a < x හ bg, each of which excludes one endpoint. Intervals can also be deûned on the integers by replacing R in the these deûni- tions by Z. Whether the interval is deûned over the reals or integers can usually be inferred from context.

B.2 Relations A binary relation R on two sets A and B is a subset of the Cartesian product AB . If .a; b/ 2 R, we sometimes write a R b. When we say that R is a binary relation on a set A, we mean that R is a subset of A  A. For example, the <less than= relation on the natural numbers is the set f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a < bg. An n-ary relation on sets A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n is a subset of A 1  A 2      A n . A binary relation R ෂ A  A is reüexive if a R a B.2 Relations 1159 for all a 2 A. For example, <D= and <හ= are reüexive relations on N, but <<= is not. The relation R is symmetric if a R b implies b R a for all a; b 2 A. For example, <D= is symmetric, but <<= and <හ= are not. The relation R is transitive if a R b and b R c imply a R c for all a; b; c 2 A. For example, the relations <<,= <හ,= and <D= are transitive, but the relation R D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a D b  1g is not, since 3 R 4 and 4 R 5 do not imply 3 R 5. A relation that is reüexive, symmetric, and transitive is an equivalence relation. For example, <D= is an equivalence relation on the natural numbers, but <<= is not. If R is an equivalence relation on a set A, then for a 2 A, the equivalence class of a is the set Œa� D fb 2 A W a R bg, that is, the set of all elements equivalent to a. For example, if we deûne R D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a C b is an even numberg, then R is an equivalence relation, since a C a is even (reüexive), a C b is even implies b C a is even (symmetric), and a C b is even and b C c is even imply a C c is even (transitive). The equivalence class of 4 is Œ4� D f0; 2; 4; 6; : : : g, and the equivalence class of 3 is Œ3� D f1; 3; 5; 7; : : : g. A basic theorem of equivalence classes is the following. Theorem B.1 (An equivalence relation is the same as a partition) The equivalence classes of any equivalence relation R on a set A form a partition of A, and any partition of A determines an equivalence relation on A for which the sets in the partition are the equivalence classes. Proof For the ûrst part of the proof, we must show that the equivalence classes of R are nonempty, pairwise-disjoint sets whose union is A. Because R is reüex- ive, a 2 Œa�, and so the equivalence classes are nonempty. Moreover, since every element a 2 A belongs to the equivalence class Œa�, the union of the equivalence classes is A. It remains to show that the equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint, that is, if two equivalence classes Œa� and Œb� have an element c in common, then they are in fact the same set. Suppose that a R c and b R c . Symmetry gives that c R b and, by transitivity, a R b. Thus, we have x R a for any arbitrary ele- ment x 2 Œa� and, by transitivity, x R b, and thus Œa� ෂ Œb�. Similarly, Œb� ෂ Œa�, and thus Œa� D Œb�. For the second part of the proof, let A D fA i g be a partition of A, and de- ûne R D f.a; b/ W there exists i such that a 2 A i and b 2 A i g. We claim that R is an equivalence relation on A. Reüexivity holds, since a 2 A i implies a R a. Symmetry holds, because if a R b, then a and b belong to the same set A i , and 1160 Appendix B Sets, Etc. hence b R a. If a R b and b R c , then all three elements are in the same set A i , and thus a R c and transitivity holds. To see that the sets in the partition are the equivalence classes of R, observe that if a 2 A i , then x 2 Œa� implies x 2 A i , and x 2 A i implies x 2 Œa�. A binary relation R on a set A is antisymmetric if a R b and b R a imply a D b : For example, the <හ= relation on the natural numbers is antisymmetric, since a හ b and b හ a imply a D b. A relation that is reüexive, antisymmetric, and transitive is a partial order, and we call a set on which a partial order is deûned a partially ordered set. For example, the relation <is a descendant of= is a partial order on the set of all people (if we view individuals as being their own descendants). In a partially ordered set A, there may be no single <maximum= element a such that b R a for all b 2 A. Instead, the set may contain several maximal elements a such that for no b 2 A, where b ¤ a, is it the case that a R b. For example, a collection of different-sized boxes may contain several maximal boxes that don’t ût inside any other box, yet it has no single <maximum= box into which any other box will ût. 3 A relation R on a set A is a total relation if for all a; b 2 A, we have a R b or b R a (or both), that is, if every pairing of elements of A is related by R. A partial order that is also a total relation is a total order or linear order. For example, the relation <හ= is a total order on the natural numbers, but the <is a descendant of= relation is not a total order on the set of all people, since there are individuals neither of whom is descended from the other. A total relation that is transitive, but not necessarily either symmetric or antisymmetric, is a total preorder. Exercises B.2-1 Prove that the subset relation <ෂ= on all subsets of Z is a partial order but not a total order. B.2-2 Show that for any positive integer n, the relation <equivalent modulo n= is an equiv- alence relation on the integers. (We say that a D b .mod n/ if there exists an integer q such that a  b D q n.) Into what equivalence classes does this relation partition the integers? 3 To be precise, in order for the <ût inside= relation to be a partial order, we need to view a box as ûtting inside itself. B.3 Functions 1161 B.2-3 Give examples of relations that are a. reüexive and symmetric but not transitive, b. reüexive and transitive but not symmetric, c. symmetric and transitive but not reüexive. B.2-4 Let S be a ûnite set, and let R be an equivalence relation on S  S . Show that if in addition R is antisymmetric, then the equivalence classes of S with respect to R are singletons. B.2-5 Professor Narcissus claims that if a relation R is symmetric and transitive, then it is also reüexive. He offers the following proof. By symmetry, a R b implies b R a. Transitivity, therefore, implies a R a. Is the professor correct? B.3 Functions Given two sets A and B , a function f is a binary relation on A and B such that for all a 2 A, there exists precisely one b 2 B such that .a; b/ 2 f . The set A is called the domain of f , and the set B is called the codomain of f . We sometimes write f W A ! B , and if .a; b/ 2 f , we write b D f .a/, since the choice of a uniquely determines b. Intuitively, the function f assigns an element of B to each element of A. No element of A is assigned two different elements of B , but the same element of B can be assigned to two different elements of A. For example, the binary relation f D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and b D a mod 2g is a function f W N ! f0; 1g, since for each natural number a, there is exactly one value b in f0; 1g such that b D a mod 2. For this example, 0 D f .0/, 1 D f .1/, 0 D f .2/, 1 D f .3/, etc. In contrast, the binary relation g D f.a; b/ W a; b 2 N and a C b is eveng is not a function, since .1; 3/ and .1; 5/ are both in g, and thus for the choice a D 1, there is not precisely one b such that .a; b/ 2 g. Given a function f W A ! B , if b D f .a/, we say that a is the argument of f and that b is the value of f at a. We can deûne a function by stating its value for 1162 Appendix B Sets, Etc. every element of its domain. For example, we might deûne f .n/ D 2n for n 2 N, which means f D f.n; 2n/ W n 2 Ng. Two functions f and g are equal if they have the same domain and codomain and if f .a/ D g.a/ for all a in the domain. A ûnite sequence of length n is a function f whose domain is the set of n inte- gers f0; 1; : : : ; n  1g. We often denote a ûnite sequence by listing its values in an- gle brackets: hf .0/; f .1/; : : : ; f .n  1/i. An inûnite sequence is a function whose domain is the set N of natural numbers. For example, the Fibonacci sequence, deûned by recurrence (3.31), is the inûnite sequence h0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; : : : i. When the domain of a function f is a Cartesian product, we often omit the extra parentheses surrounding the argument of f . For example, if we have a function f W A 1 A 2   A n ! B , we write b D f .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n / instead of writing b D f ..a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n //. We also call each a i an argument to the function f , though technically f has just a single argument, which is the n-tuple .a 1 ; a 2 ; : : : ; a n /. If f W A ! B is a function and b D f .a/, then we sometimes say that b is the image of a under f . The image of a set A 0 ෂ A under f is deûned by f .A 0 / D fb 2 B W b D f .a/ for some a 2 A 0 g : The range of f is the image of its domain, that is, f .A/. For example, the range of the function f W N ! N deûned by f .n/ D 2n is f .N/ D fm W m D 2n for some n 2 Ng, in other words, the set of nonnegative even integers. A function is a surjection if its range is its codomain. For example, the func- tion f .n/ D bn=2c is a surjective function from N to N, since every element in N appears as the value of f for some argument. In contrast, the function f .n/ D 2n is not a surjective function from N to N, since no argument to f can produce any odd natural number as a value. The function f .n/ D 2n is, however, a surjective function from the natural numbers to the even numbers. A surjection f W A ! B is sometimes described as mapping A onto B . When we say that f is onto, we mean that it is surjective. A function f W A ! B is an injection if distinct arguments to f produce dis- tinct values, that is, if a ¤ a 0 implies f .a/ ¤ f .a 0 /. For example, the function f .n/ D 2n is an injective function from N to N, since each even number b is the image under f of at most one element of the domain, namely b=2. The func- tion f .n/ D bn=2c is not injective, since the value 1 is produced by two arguments: f .2/ D 1 and f .3/ D 1. An injection is sometimes called a one-to-one function. A function f W A ! B is a bijection if it is injective and surjective. For example, the function f .n/ D .1/ n dn=2e is a bijection from N to Z: B.3 Functions 1163 0 ! 0 ; 1 ! 1 ; 2 ! 1 ; 3 ! 2 ; 4 ! 2 ; : : : The function is injective, since no element of Z is the image of more than one element of N. It is surjective, since every element of Z appears as the image of some element of N. Hence, the function is bijective. A bijection is sometimes called a one-to-one correspondence, since it pairs elements in the domain and codomain. A bijection from a set A to itself is sometimes called a permutation. When a function f is bijective, we deûne its inverse f 1 as f 1 .b/ D a if and only if f .a/ D b : For example, the inverse of the function f .n/ D .1/ n dn=2e is f 1 .m/ D ( 2m if m  0 ; 2m  1 if m < 0 : Exercises B.3-1 Let A and B be ûnite sets, and let f W A ! B be a function. Show the following: a. If f is injective, then jAj හ jB j. b. If f is surjective, then jAj  jB j. B.3-2 Is the function f .x/ D x C 1 bijective when the domain and the codomain are the set N? Is it bijective when the domain and the codomain are the set Z? B.3-3 Give a natural deûnition for the inverse of a binary relation such that if a relation is in fact a bijective function, its relational inverse is its functional inverse. ? B.3-4 Give a bijection from Z to Z  Z. 1164 Appendix B Sets, Etc. B.4 Graphs This section presents two kinds of graphs: directed and undirected. Certain def- initions in the literature differ from those given here, but for the most part, the differences are slight. Section 20.1 shows how to represent graphs in computer memory. A directed graph (or digraph) G is a pair .V; E/, where V is a ûnite set and E is a binary relation on V . The set V is called the vertex set of G, and its elements are called vertices (singular: vertex). The set E is called the edge set of G, and its elements are called edges. Figure B.2(a) is a pictorial representation of a directed graph on the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g . Vertices are represented by circles in the ûgure, and edges are represented by arrows. Self-loops4edges from a vertex to itself4are possible. In an undirected graph G D .V; E/, the edge set E consists of unordered pairs of vertices, rather than ordered pairs. That is, an edge is a set fu; vg, where u; v 2 V and u ¤ v. By convention, we use the notation .u; v/ for an edge, rather than the set notation fu; vg, and we consider .u; v/ and .v; u/ to be the same edge. In an undirected graph, self-loops are forbidden, so that every edge consists of two distinct vertices. Figure B.2(b) shows an undirected graph on the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g . Many deûnitions for directed and undirected graphs are the same, although cer- tain terms have slightly different meanings in the two contexts. If .u; v/ is an edge in a directed graph G D .V; E/, we say that .u; v/ is incident from or leaves ver- tex u and is incident to or enters vertex v. For example, the edges leaving vertex 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 (a) 1 2 3 4 5 6 (b) 1 2 3 6 (c) Figure B.2 Directed and undirected graphs.

If .u; v/ is an edge in an undirected graph G D .V; E/, we say that .u; v/ is incident on vertices u and v. In Figure B.2(b), the edges incident on vertex 2 are .1; 2/ and .2; 5/. If .u; v/ is an edge in a graph G D .V; E/, we say that vertex v is adjacent to vertex u. When the graph is undirected, the adjacency relation is symmetric. When the graph is directed, the adjacency relation is not necessarily symmetric. If v is adjacent to u in a directed graph, we can write u ! v. In parts (a) and (b) of Figure B.2, vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, since the edge .1; 2/ belongs to both graphs. Vertex 1 is not adjacent to vertex 2 in Figure B.2(a), since the edge .2; 1/ is absent. The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident on it. For example, vertex 2 in Figure B.2(b) has degree 2. A vertex whose degree is 0, such as vertex 4 in Figure B.2(b), is isolated. In a directed graph, the out-degree of a vertex is the number of edges leaving it, and the in-degree of a vertex is the number of edges entering it. The degree of a vertex in a directed graph is its in- degree plus its out-degree. Vertex 2 in Figure B.2(a) has in-degree 2, out-degree 3, and degree 5. A path of length k from a vertex u to a vertex u 0 in a graph G D .V; E/ is a sequence hv 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k i of vertices such that u D v 0 , u 0 D v k , and .v i 1 ; v i / 2 E for i D 1; 2; : : : ; k. The length of the path is the number of edges in the path, which is 1 less than the number of vertices in the path. The path contains the vertices v 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k and the edges .v 0 ; v 1 /; .v 1 ; v 2 /; : : : ; .v k1 ; v k /. (There is always a 0-length path from u to u.) If there is a path p from u to u 0 , we say that u 0 is reachable from u via p, which we can write as u p ❀ u 0 . A path is simple 4 if all vertices in the path are distinct. In Figure B.2(a), the path h1; 2; 5; 4i is a simple path of length 3. The path h2; 5; 4; 5i is not simple. A subpath of path p D hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i is a contiguous subsequence of its vertices. That is, for any 0 හ i හ j හ k, the subsequence of vertices hv i ; v i C1 ; : : : ; v j i is a subpath of p. In a directed graph, a path hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i forms a cycle if v 0 D v k and the path contains at least one edge. The cycle is simple if, in addition, v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k are distinct. A cycle consisting of k vertices has length k. A self-loop is a cycle of length 1. Two paths hv 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k1 ; v 0 i and hv 0 0 ; v 0 1 ; v 0 2 ; : : : ; v 0 k1 ; v 0 0 i form the same cycle if there exists an integer j such that v 0 i D v .i Cj / mod k for i D 0; 1; : : : ; k1. In Figure B.2(a), the path h1; 2; 4; 1i forms the same cycle as the paths h2; 4; 1; 2i and h4; 1; 2; 4i. This cycle is simple, but the cycle h1; 2; 4; 5; 4; 1i is not. The cycle h2; 2i formed by the edge .2; 2/ is a self-loop. A directed graph 4 Some authors refer to what we call a path as a <walk= and to what we call a simple path as just a <path.= 1166 Appendix B Sets, Etc. with no self-loops is simple. In an undirected graph, a path hv 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v k i forms a cycle if k > 0, v 0 D v k , and all edges on the path are distinct. The cycle is simple if v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k are distinct. For example, in Figure B.2(b), the path h1; 2; 5; 1i is a simple cycle. A graph with no simple cycles is acyclic. An undirected graph is connected if every vertex is reachable from all other vertices. The connected components of an undirected graph are the equivalence classes of vertices under the <is reachable from= relation. The graph shown in Figure B.2(b) has three connected components: f1; 2; 5g, f3; 6g, and f4g. Every vertex in the connected component f1; 2; 5g is reachable from every other vertex in f1; 2; 5g. An undirected graph is connected if it has exactly one connected com- ponent. The edges of a connected component are those that are incident on only the vertices of the component. In other words, edge .u; v/ is an edge of a connected component only if both u and v are vertices of the component. A directed graph is strongly connected if every two vertices are reachable from each other. The strongly connected components of a directed graph are the equiv- alence classes of vertices under the <are mutually reachable= relation. A directed graph is strongly connected if it has only one strongly connected component. The graph in Figure B.2(a) has three strongly connected components: f1; 2; 4; 5g, f3g, and f6g. All pairs of vertices in f1; 2; 4; 5g are mutually reachable. The ver- tices f3; 6g do not form a strongly connected component, since vertex 6 cannot be reached from vertex 3. Two graphs G D .V; E/ and G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / are isomorphic if there exists a bijection f W V ! V 0 such that .u; v/ 2 E if and only if .f .u/; f .v// 2 E 0 . In other words, G and G 0 are isomorphic if the vertices of G can be relabeled to be vertices of G 0 , maintaining the corresponding edges in G and G 0 . Fig- ure B.3(a) shows a pair of isomorphic graphs G and G 0 with respective vertex sets V D f1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6g and V 0 D fu; v; w; x; y; ´g. The mapping from V to V 0 given by f .1/ D u; f .2/ D v; f .3/ D w; f .4/ D x; f .5/ D y; f .6/ D ´ provides the required bijective function. The graphs in Figure B.3(b) are not iso- morphic. Although both graphs have 5 vertices and 7 edges, the top graph has a vertex of degree 4 and the bottom graph does not. We say that a graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 / is a subgraph of G D .V; E/ if V 0 ෂ V and E 0 ෂ E. Given a set V 0 ෂ V , the subgraph of G induced by V 0 is the graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where E 0 D f.u; v/ 2 E W u; v 2 V 0 g : The subgraph induced by the vertex set f1; 2; 3; 6g in Figure B.2(a) appears in Figure B.2(c) and has the edge set f.1; 2/; .2; 2/; .6; 3/g . Given an undirected graph G D .V; E/, the directed version of G is the directed graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where .u; v/ 2 E 0 if and only if .u; v/ 2 E. That is, each undirected edge .u; v/ in G turns into two directed edges, .u; v/ and .v; u/, in the B.4 Graphs 1167 1 2 3 4 5 6 u w x y z (a) 1 2 3 4 5 u w x y (b) G Gʹ v v Figure B.3 (a) A pair of isomorphic graphs.

The top graph has a vertex of degree 4, and the bottom graph does not. directed version. Given a directed graph G D .V; E/, the undirected version of G is the undirected graph G 0 D .V; E 0 /, where .u; v/ 2 E 0 if and only if u ¤ v and E contains at least one of the edges .u; v/ and .v; u/. That is, the undirected version contains the edges of G <with their directions removed= and with self-loops eliminated. (Since .u; v/ and .v; u/ are the same edge in an undirected graph, the undirected version of a directed graph contains it only once, even if the directed graph contains both edges .u; v/ and .v; u/.) In a directed graph G D .V; E/, a neighbor of a vertex u is any vertex that is adjacent to u in the undirected version of G. That is, v is a neighbor of u if u ¤ v and either .u; v/ 2 E or .v; u/ 2 E. In an undirected graph, u and v are neighbors if they are adjacent. Several kinds of graphs have special names. A complete graph is an undirected graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent. An undirected graph G D .V; E/ is bipartite if V can be partitioned into two sets V 1 and V 2 such that .u; v/ 2 E implies either u 2 V 1 and v 2 V 2 or u 2 V 2 and v 2 V 1 . That is, all edges go between the two sets V 1 and V 2 . An acyclic, undirected graph is a forest, and a connected, acyclic, undirected graph is a (free) tree (see Section B.5). We often take the ûrst letters of <directed acyclic graph= and call such a graph a dag. There are two variants of graphs that you may occasionally encounter. A multi- graph is like an undirected graph, but it can have both multiple edges between ver- tices (such as two distinct edges .u; v/ and .u; v/) and self-loops. A hypergraph is like an undirected graph, but each hyperedge, rather than connecting two vertices, 1168 Appendix B Sets, Etc. connects an arbitrary subset of vertices. Many algorithms written for ordinary di- rected and undirected graphs can be adapted to run on these graphlike structures. The contraction of an undirected graph G D .V; E/ by an edge e D .u; v/ is a graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where V 0 D V  fu; vg [ fx g and x is a new vertex. The set of edges E 0 is formed from E by deleting the edge .u; v/ and, for each vertex w adjacent to u or v, deleting whichever of .u; w/ and .v; w/ belongs to E and adding the new edge .x; w/. In effect, u and v are <contracted= into a single vertex. Exercises B.4-1 Attendees of a faculty party shake hands to greet each other, with every pair of professors shaking hands one time. Each professor remembers the number of times he or she shook hands. At the end of the party, the department head asks the professors for their totals and adds them all up.

B.4-4 Verify that in an undirected graph, the <is reachable from= relation is an equiv- alence relation on the vertices of the graph. Which of the three properties of an equivalence relation hold in general for the <is reachable from= relation on the vertices of a directed graph? B.4-5 What is the undirected version of the directed graph in Figure B.2(a)? What is the directed version of the undirected graph in Figure B.2(b)? B.4-6 Show how a bipartite graph can represent a hypergraph by letting incidence in the hypergraph correspond to adjacency in the bipartite graph. (Hint: Let one set of B.5 Trees 1169 vertices in the bipartite graph correspond to vertices of the hypergraph, and let the other set of vertices of the bipartite graph correspond to hyperedges.) B.5 Trees As with graphs, there are many related, but slightly different, notions of trees. This section presents deûnitions and mathematical properties of several kinds of trees. Sections 10.3 and 20.1 describe how to represent trees in computer memory. B.5.1 Free trees As deûned in Section B.4, a free tree is a connected, acyclic, undirected graph. We often omit the adjective <free= when we say that a graph is a tree. If an undirected graph is acyclic but possibly disconnected, it is a forest. Many algorithms that work for trees also work for forests. Figure B.4(a) shows a free tree, and Figure B.4(b) shows a forest. The forest in Figure B.4(b) is not a tree because it is not connected. The graph in Figure B.4(c) is connected but neither a tree nor a forest, because it contains a cycle. The following theorem captures many important facts about free trees. Theorem B.2 (Properties of free trees) Let G D .V; E/ be an undirected graph. The following statements are equivalent. 1. G is a free tree. 2. Any two vertices in G are connected by a unique simple path. 3. G is connected, but if any edge is removed from E, the resulting graph is dis- connected. (a) (b) (c) Figure B.4 (a) A free tree. (b) A forest. (c) A graph that contains a cycle and is therefore neither a tree nor a forest. 1170 Appendix B Sets, Etc. u w z x y pʹ pʹʹ v Figure B.5 A step in the proof of Theorem B.2: if (1) G is a free tree, then (2) any two vertices in G are connected by a unique simple path. Assume for the sake of contradiction that vertices u and v are connected by two distinct simple paths. These paths ûrst diverge at vertex w, and they ûrst reconverge at vertex ´. The path p 0 concatenated with the reverse of the path p 00 forms a cycle, which yields the contradiction. 4. G is connected, and jEj D jV j  1. 5. G is acyclic, and jEj D jV j  1. 6. G is acyclic, but if any edge is added to E, the resulting graph contains a cycle. Proof (1) ) (2): Since a tree is connected, any two vertices in G are connected by at least one simple path. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that vertices u and v are connected by two distinct simple paths as shown in Figure B.5. Let w be the vertex at which the paths ûrst diverge. That is, if we call the paths p 1 and p 2 , then w is the ûrst vertex on both p 1 and p 2 whose successor on p 1 is x and whose successor on p 2 is y , where x ¤ y . Let ´ be the ûrst vertex at which the paths reconverge, that is, ´ is the ûrst vertex following w on p 1 that is also on p 2 . Let p 0 D w ! x ❀ ´ be the subpath of p 1 from w through x to ´, so that p 1 D u ❀ w p 0 ❀ ´ ❀ v, and let p 00 D w ! y ❀ ´ be the subpath of p 2 from w through y to ´, so that p 2 D u ❀ w p 00 ❀ ´ ❀ v. Paths p 0 and p 00 share no vertices except their endpoints. Then, as Figure B.5 shows, the path obtained by concatenating p 0 and the reverse of p 00 is a cycle, which contradicts our assumption that G is a tree. Thus, if G is a tree, there can be at most one simple path between two vertices. (2) ) (3): If any two vertices in G are connected by a unique simple path, then G is connected. Let .u; v/ be any edge in E. This edge is a path from u to v, and so it must be the unique path from u to v. If .u; v/ were to be removed from G, there would be no path from u to v, and G would be disconnected. (3) ) (4): By assumption, the graph G is connected, so Exercise B.4-3 gives that jEj  jV j  1. We prove jEj හ jV j  1 by induction on jV j. The base cases are when jV j D 1 or jV j D 2, and in either case, jEj D jV j  1. For the inductive step, suppose that jV j  3 for graph G and that any graph G 0 D .V 0 ; E 0 /, where B.5 Trees 1171 V 0 j < jV j, that satisûes (3) also satisûes jE 0 j හ jV 0 j  1. Removing an arbi- trary edge from G separates the graph into k  2 connected components (actually k D 2). Each component satisûes (3), or else G would not satisfy (3). Consider each connected component V i , with edge set E i , as a separate free tree. Then, because each connected component has fewer than jV j vertices, the inductive hy- pothesis implies that jE i j හ jV i j  1. Thus, the number of edges in all k connected components combined is at most jV j  k හ jV j  2. Adding in the removed edge yields jEj හ jV j  1. (4) ) (5): Suppose that G is connected and that jEj D jV j  1. We must show that G is acyclic. Suppose that G has a cycle containing k vertices v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k , and without loss of generality assume that this cycle is simple. Let G k D .V k ; E k / be the subgraph of G consisting of the cycle, so that jV k j D jE k j D k. If k < jV j, then because G is connected, there must be a vertex v kC1 2 V  V k that is adjacent to some vertex v i 2 V k . Deûne G kC1 D .V kC1 ; E kC1 / to be the subgraph of G with V kC1 D V k [ fv kC1 g and E kC1 D E k [ f.v i ; v kC1 /g. Note that jV kC1 j D jE kC1 j D k C 1. If k C 1 < jV j, then continue, deûning G kC2 in the same manner, and so forth, until we obtain G n D .V n ; E n /, where n D jV j, V n D V , and jE n j D jV n j D jV j. Since G n is a subgraph of G, we have E n ෂ E, and hence jEj  jE n j D jV n j D jV j, which contradicts the assumption that jEj D jV j  1. Thus, G is acyclic. (5) ) (6): Suppose that G is acyclic and that jEj D jV j  1. Let k be the number of connected components of G. Each connected component is a free tree by deûnition, and since (1) implies (5), the sum of all edges in all connected com- ponents of G is jV j  k. Consequently, k must equal 1, and G is in fact a tree. Since (1) implies (2), any two vertices in G are connected by a unique simple path. Thus, adding any edge to G creates a cycle. (6) ) (1): Suppose that G is acyclic but that adding any edge to E creates a cycle. We must show that G is connected. Let u and v be arbitrary vertices in G. If u and v are not already adjacent, adding the edge .u; v/ creates a cycle in which all edges but .u; v/ belong to G. Thus, the cycle minus edge .u; v/ must contain a path from u to v, and since u and v were chosen arbitrarily, G is connected. B.5.2 Rooted and ordered trees A rooted tree is a free tree in which one of the vertices is distinguished from the others. We call the distinguished vertex the root of the tree. We often refer to a 1172 Appendix B Sets, Etc. 9 6 5 8 1 12 3 10 7 11 2 4 height = 4 depth 0 depth 1 depth 2 depth 3 depth 4 (a) 9 6 5 8 12 3 10 7 11 2 4 (b) 1 Figure B.6 Rooted and ordered trees. (a) A rooted tree with height 4. The tree is drawn in a standard way: the root (node 7) is at the top, its children (nodes with depth 1) are beneath it, their children (nodes with depth 2) are beneath them, and so forth. If the tree is ordered, the relative left- to-right order of the children of a node matters; otherwise, it doesn’t. (b) Another rooted tree. As a rooted tree, it is identical to the tree in (a), but as an ordered tree it is different, since the children of node 3 appear in a different order. vertex of a rooted tree as a node 5 of the tree. Figure B.6(a) shows a rooted tree on a set of 12 nodes with root 7. Consider a node x in a rooted tree T with root r . We call any node y on the unique simple path from r to x an ancestor of x . If y is an ancestor of x , then x is a descendant of y . (Every node is both an ancestor and a descendant of itself.) If y is an ancestor of x and x ¤ y , then y is a proper ancestor of x and x is a proper descendant of y . The subtree rooted at x is the tree induced by descendants of x , rooted at x . For example, the subtree rooted at node 8 in Figure B.6(a) contains nodes 8, 6, 5, and 9. If the last edge on the simple path from the root r of a tree T to a node x is .y; x/, then y is the parent of x , and x is a child of y . The root is the only node in T with no parent. If two nodes have the same parent, they are siblings. A node with no children is a leaf or external node. A nonleaf node is an internal node. 5 The term <node= is often used in the graph theory literature as a synonym for <vertex.= We reserve the term <node= to mean a vertex of a rooted tree. B.5 Trees 1173 The number of children of a node x in a rooted tree T is the degree of x . 6 The length of the simple path from the root r to a node x is the depth of x in T . A level of a tree consists of all nodes at the same depth. The height of a node in a tree is the number of edges on the longest simple downward path from the node to a leaf, and the height of a tree is the height of its root. The height of a tree is also equal to the largest depth of any node in the tree. An ordered tree is a rooted tree in which the children of each node are ordered. That is, if a node has k children, then there is a ûrst child, a second child, and so on, up to and including a kth child. The two trees in Figure B.6 are different when considered to be ordered trees, but the same when considered to be just rooted trees. B.5.3 Binary and positional trees We deûne binary trees recursively. A binary tree T is a structure deûned on a ûnite set of nodes that either contains no nodes, or  is composed of three disjoint sets of nodes: a root node, a binary tree called its left subtree, and a binary tree called its right subtree. The binary tree that contains no nodes is called the empty tree or null tree, some- times denoted NIL. If the left subtree is nonempty, its root is called the left child of the root of the entire tree. Likewise, the root of a nonnull right subtree is the right child of the root of the entire tree. If a subtree is the null tree NIL, we say that the child is absent or missing. Figure B.7(a) shows a binary tree. A binary tree is not simply an ordered tree in which each node has degree at most 2. For example, in a binary tree, if a node has just one child, the position of the child4whether it is the left child or the right child4matters. In an or- dered tree, there is no distinguishing a sole child as being either left or right. Fig- ure B.7(b) shows a binary tree that differs from the tree in Figure B.7(a) because of the position of one node. Considered as ordered trees, however, the two trees are identical. One way to represent the positioning information in a binary tree is by the inter- nal nodes of an ordered tree, as shown in Figure B.7(c). The idea is to replace each missing child in the binary tree with a node having no children. These leaf nodes 6 The degree of a node depends on whether we consider T to be a rooted tree or a free tree. The degree of a vertex in a free tree is, as in any undirected graph, the number of adjacent vertices. In a rooted tree, however, the degree is the number of children4the parent of a node does not count toward its degree. 1174 Appendix B Sets, Etc. 3 2 4 1 6 7 5 (a) 3 2 4 1 6 7 5 (b) 3 2 4 1 6 7 5 (c) Figure B.7 Binary trees. (a) A binary tree drawn in a standard way. The left child of a node is drawn beneath the node and to the left. The right child is drawn beneath and to the right. (b) A binary tree different from the one in (a). In (a), the left child of node 7 is 5 and the right child is absent. In (b), the left child of node 7 is absent and the right child is 5. As ordered trees, these trees are the same, but as binary trees, they are distinct. (c) The binary tree in (a) represented by the internal nodes of a full binary tree: an ordered tree in which each internal node has degree 2. The leaves in the tree are shown as squares. are drawn as squares in the ûgure. The tree that results is a full binary tree: each node is either a leaf or has degree exactly 2. No nodes have degree 1. Consequently, the order of the children of a node preserves the position information. The positioning information that distinguishes binary trees from ordered trees extends to trees with more than two children per node. In a positional tree, the children of a node are labeled with distinct positive integers. The i th child of a node is absent if no child is labeled with integer i . A k-ary tree is a positional tree in which for every node, all children with labels greater than k are missing. Thus, a binary tree is a k-ary tree with k D 2. A complete k-ary tree is a k-ary tree in which all leaves have the same depth and all internal nodes have degree k. Figure B.8 shows a complete binary tree of height 3. How many leaves does a complete k-ary tree of height h have? The root has k children at depth 1, each of which has k children at depth 2, etc. Thus, the number of nodes at depth d is k d . In a complete k-ary tree with height h, the leaves are at depth h, so that there are k h leaves. Consequently, the height of a complete k-ary tree with n leaves is log k n. A complete k-ary tree of height h has 1 C k C k 2 C    C k h1 D h1 X d D0 k d D k h  1 k  1 (by equation (A.6) on page 1142) internal nodes.

Every group of six people contains either at least three mutual friends or at least three mutual strangers. c. Any group of people can be partitioned into two subgroups such that at least half the friends of each person belong to the subgroup of which that person is not a member. Notes for Appendix B 1177 d. If everyone in a group is the friend of at least half the people in the group, then the group can be seated around a table in such a way that everyone is seated between two friends. B-3 Bisecting trees Many divide-and-conquer algorithms that operate on graphs require that the graph be bisected into two nearly equal-sized subgraphs, which are induced by a partition of the vertices. This problem investigates bisections of trees formed by removing a small number of edges. We require that whenever two vertices end up in the same subtree after removing edges, then they must belong to the same partition. a. Show that the vertices of any n-vertex binary tree can be partitioned into two sets A and B , such that jAj හ 3n=4 and jB j හ 3n=4, by removing a single edge. b. Show that the constant 3=4 in part (a) is optimal in the worst case by giving an example of a simple binary tree whose most evenly balanced partition upon removal of a single edge has jAj D 3n=4. c. Show that by removing at most O.lg n/ edges, we can partition the vertices of any n-vertex binary tree into two sets A and B such that jAj D bn=2c and jB j D dn=2e. Appendix notes G. Boole pioneered the development of symbolic logic, and he introduced many of the basic set notations in a book published in 1854. Modern set theory was created by G. Cantor during the period 187431895. Cantor focused primarily on sets of inûnite cardinality. The term <function= is attributed to G. W. Leibniz, who used it to refer to several kinds of mathematical formulas. His limited deûnition has been generalized many times. Graph theory originated in 1736, when L. Euler proved that it was impossible to cross each of the seven bridges in the city of K¨ onigsberg exactly once and return to the starting point. The book by Harary [208] provides a useful compendium of many deûnitions and results from graph theory. C Counting and Probability This appendix reviews elementary combinatorics and probability theory. If you have a good background in these areas, you may want to skim the beginning of this appendix lightly and concentrate on the later sections. Most of this book’s chapters do not require probability, but for some chapters it is essential. Section C.1 reviews elementary results in counting theory, including standard formulas for counting permutations and combinations. The axioms of probability and basic facts concerning probability distributions form Section C.2. Random variables are introduced in Section C.3, along with the properties of expectation and variance. Section C.4 investigates the geometric and binomial distributions that arise from studying Bernoulli trials. The study of the binomial distribution continues in Section C.5, an advanced discussion of the <tails= of the distribution. C.1 Counting Counting theory tries to answer the question <How many?= without actually enu- merating all the choices. For example, you might ask, <How many different n-bit numbers are there?= or <How many orderings of n distinct elements are there?= This section reviews the elements of counting theory. Since some of the material assumes a basic understanding of sets, you might wish to start by reviewing the material in Section B.1. Rules of sum and product We can sometimes express a set of items that we wish to count as a union of disjoint sets or as a Cartesian product of sets. The rule of sum says that the number of ways to choose one element from one of two disjoint sets is the sum of the cardinalities of the sets. That is, if A and B are two ûnite sets with no members in common, then jA [ B j D jAj C jB j, which C.1 Counting 1179 follows from equation (B.3) on page 1156. For example, if each position on a car’s license plate is a letter or a digit, then the number of possibilities for each position is 26 C 10 D 36, since there are 26 choices if it is a letter and 10 choices if it is a digit. The rule of product says that the number of ways to choose an ordered pair is the number of ways to choose the ûrst element times the number of ways to choose the second element. That is, if A and B are two ûnite sets, then jA  B j D jAjjB j, which is simply equation (B.4) on page 1157. For example, if an ice-cream parlor offers 28 üavors of ice cream and four toppings, the number of possible sundaes with one scoop of ice cream and one topping is 28  4 D 112. Strings A string over a ûnite set S is a sequence of elements of S . For example, there are eight binary strings of length 3: 000; 001; 010; 011; 100; 101; 110; 111 : (Here we use the shorthand of omitting the angle brackets when denoting a se- quence.) We sometimes call a string of length k a k-string. A substring s 0 of a string s is an ordered sequence of consecutive elements of s . A k-substring of a string is a substring of length k. For example, 010 is a 3-substring of 01101001 (the 3-substring that begins in position 4), but 111 is not a substring of 01101001. We can view a k-string over a set S as an element of the Cartesian product S k of k-tuples, which means that there are jS j k strings of length k. For example, the number of binary k-strings is 2 k . Intuitively, to construct a k-string over an n-set, there are n ways to pick the ûrst element; for each of these choices, there are n ways to pick the second element; and so forth k times. This construction leads to the k-fold product n  n    n ˜ n times D n k as the number of k-strings. Permutations A permutation of a ûnite set S is an ordered sequence of all the elements of S , with each element appearing exactly once. For example, if S D fa; b; c g, then S has 6 permutations: abc; acb; bac; bca; cab; cba : (Again, we use the shorthand of omitting the angle brackets when denoting a se- quence.) There are nŠ permutations of a set of n elements, since there are n ways to choose the ûrst element of the sequence, n  1 ways for the second element, n  2 ways for the third, and so on. 1180 Appendix C Counting and Probability A k-permutation of S is an ordered sequence of k elements of S , with no ele- ment appearing more than once in the sequence. (Thus, an ordinary permutation is an n-permutation of an n-set.) Here are the 2-permutations of the set fa; b; c; d g: ab; ac; ad; ba; bc; bd; ca; cb; cd; da; db; dc : The number of k-permutations of an n-set is n.n  1/.n  2/    .n  k C 1/ D nŠ .n  k/Š ; (C.1) since there are n ways to choose the ûrst element, n  1 ways to choose the second element, and so on, until k elements are chosen, with the last element chosen from the remaining n  k C 1 elements. For the above example, with n D 4 and k D 2, the formula (C.1) evaluates to 4Š=2Š D 12, matching the number of 2-permutations listed. Combinations A k-combination of an n-set S is simply a k-subset of S . For example, the 4-set fa; b; c; d g has six 2-combinations: ab; ac; ad; bc; bd; cd : (Here we use the shorthand of omitting the braces around each subset.) To con- struct a k-combination of an n-set, choose k distinct (different) elements from the n-set. The order of selecting the elements does not matter. We can express the number of k-combinations of an n-set in terms of the number of k-permutations of an n-set. Every k-combination has exactly kŠ permutations of its elements, each of which is a distinct k-permutation of the n-set. Thus the number of k-combinations of an n-set is the number of k-permutations divided by kŠ. From equation (C.1), this quantity is nŠ kŠ .n  k/Š : (C.2) For k D 0, this formula tells us that the number of ways to choose 0 elements from an n-set is 1 (not 0), since 0Š D 1. Binomial coefﬁcients The notation ã n k ä (read <n choose k=) denotes the number of k-combinations of an n-set. Equation (C.2) gives  n k ! D nŠ kŠ .n  k/Š : C.1 Counting 1181 This formula is symmetric in k and n  k:  n k ! D  n n  k ! : (C.3) These numbers are also known as binomial coefﬁcients, due to their appearance in the binomial theorem: .x C y/ n D n X kD0  n k ! x k y nk ; (C.4) where n 2 N and x; y 2 R. The right-hand side of equation (C.4) is called the binomial expansion of the left-hand side. A special case of the binomial theorem occurs when x D y D 1: 2 n D n X kD0  n k ! : This formula corresponds to counting the 2 n binary n-strings by the number of 1s they contain: ã n k ä binary n-strings contain exactly k 1s, since there are ã n k ä ways to choose k out of the n positions in which to place the 1s. Many identities involve binomial coefûcients. The exercises at the end of this section give you the opportunity to prove a few. Binomial bounds You sometimes need to bound the size of a binomial coefûcient. For 1 හ k හ n, we have the lower bound n k ! D n.n  1/    .n  k C 1/ k.k  1/    1 D  n k Í Î n  1 k  1 Ï    Î n  k C 1 1 Ï   n k Í k : (C.5) Taking advantage of the inequality kŠ  .k=e/ k derived from Stirling’s approxi- mation (3.25) on page 67, we obtain the upper bounds  n k !

C.2 Probability Probability is an essential tool for the design and analysis of probabilistic and ran- domized algorithms. This section reviews basic probability theory. C.2 Probability 1185 We deûne probability in terms of a sample space S , which is a set whose ele- ments are called outcomes or elementary events. Think of each outcome as a pos- sible result of an experiment. For the experiment of üipping two distinguishable coins, with each individual üip resulting in a head (H) or a tail (T), you can view the sample space S as consisting of the set of all possible 2-strings over fH; Tg: S D fHH; HT; TH; TTg : An event is a subset 1 of the sample space S . For example, in the experiment of üipping two coins, the event of obtaining one head and one tail is fHT; THg. The event S is called the certain event, and the event ; is called the null event. We say that two events A and B are mutually exclusive if A \\ B D ;. An outcome s also deûnes the event fs g, which we sometimes write as just s . By deûnition, all outcomes are mutually exclusive. Axioms of probability A probability distribution Pr fg on a sample space S is a mapping from events of S to real numbers satisfying the following probability axioms: 1. Pr fAg  0 for any event A. 2. Pr fS g D 1. 3. Pr fA [ B g D Pr fAg C Pr fB g for any two mutually exclusive events A and B . More generally, for any sequence of events A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : (ûnite or countably inû- nite) that are pairwise mutually exclusive, Pr ï [ i A i ð D X i Pr fA i g : We call Pr fAg the probability of the event A. Axiom 2 is simply a normalization requirement: there is really nothing fundamental about choosing 1 as the probabil- ity of the certain event, except that it is natural and convenient. Several results follow immediately from these axioms and basic set theory (see Section B.1). The null event ; has probability Pr f;g D 0. If A ෂ B , then 1 For a general probability distribution, there may be some subsets of the sample space S that are not considered to be events. This situation usually arises when the sample space is uncountably inûnite. The main requirement for what subsets are events is that the set of events of a sample space must be closed under the operations of taking the complement of an event, forming the union of a ûnite or countable number of events, and taking the intersection of a ûnite or countable number of events. Most of the probability distributions we see in this book are over ûnite or countable sample spaces, and we generally consider all subsets of a sample space to be events. A notable exception is the continuous uniform probability distribution, which we’ll see shortly. 1186 Appendix C Counting and Probability Pr fAg හ Pr fB g. Using A to denote the event S  A (the complement of A), we have Pr ˚ A  D 1  Pr fAg. For any two events A and B , Pr fA [ B g D Pr fAg C Pr fB g  Pr fA \\ B g (C.14) හ Pr fAg C Pr fB g : (C.15) In our coin-üipping example, suppose that each of the four outcomes has prob- ability 1=4. Then the probability of getting at least one head is Pr fHH; HT; THg D Pr fHHg C Pr fHTg C Pr fTHg D 3=4 : Another way to obtain the same result is to observe that since the probability of getting strictly less than one head is Pr fTTg D 1=4, the probability of getting at least one head is 1  1=4 D 3=4. Discrete probability distributions A probability distribution is discrete if it is deûned over a ûnite or countably inûnite sample space. Let S be the sample space. Then for any event A, Pr fAg D X s2A Pr fs g ; since outcomes, speciûcally those in A, are mutually exclusive. If S is ûnite and every outcome s 2 S has probability Pr fs g D 1= jS j, then we have the uniform probability distribution on S . In such a case the experiment is often described as <picking an element of S at random.= As an example, consider the process of üipping a fair coin, one for which the probability of obtaining a head is the same as the probability of obtaining a tail, that is, 1=2. Flipping the coin n times gives the uniform probability distribution deûned on the sample space S D fH; Tg n , a set of size 2 n . We can represent each outcome in S as a string of length n over fH; Tg, with each string occurring with probability 1=2 n . The event A D fexactly k heads and exactly n  k tails occurg is a subset of S of size jAj D ã n k ä , since ã n k ä strings of length n over fH; Tg contain exactly k H’s. The probability of event A is thus Pr fAg D ã n k ä =2 n . Continuous uniform probability distribution The continuous uniform probability distribution is an example of a probability dis- tribution in which not all subsets of the sample space are considered to be events. The continuous uniform probability distribution is deûned over a closed inter- val Œa; b� of the reals, where a < b. The intuition is that each point in the in- terval Œa; b� should be <equally likely.= Because there are an uncountable number C.2 Probability 1187 of points, however, if all points had the same ûnite, positive probability, axioms 2 and 3 would not be simultaneously satisûed. For this reason, we’d like to associate a probability only with some of the subsets of S in such a way that the axioms are satisûed for these events. For any closed interval Œc; d �, where a හ c හ d හ b, the continuous uniform probability distribution deûnes the probability of the event Œc; d � to be Pr fŒc; d �g D d  c b  a : Letting c D d gives that the probability of a single point is 0. Removing the end- points Œc; c� and Œd; d � of an interval Œc; d � results in the open interval .c; d /. Since Œc; d � D Œc; c� [ .c; d / [ Œd; d �, axiom 3 gives Pr fŒc; d �g D Pr f.c; d /g. Generally, the set of events for the continuous uniform probability distribution contains any subset of the sample space Œa; b� that can be obtained by a ûnite or countable union of open and closed intervals, as well as certain more complicated sets. Conditional probability and independence Sometimes you have some prior partial knowledge about the outcome of an exper- iment. For example, suppose that a friend has üipped two fair coins and has told you that at least one of the coins showed a head. What is the probability that both coins are heads? The information given eliminates the possibility of two tails. The three remaining outcomes are equally likely, and so you infer that each occurs with probability 1=3. Since only one of these outcomes shows two heads, the answer is 1=3. Conditional probability formalizes the notion of having prior partial knowledge of the outcome of an experiment. The conditional probability of an event A given that another event B occurs is deûned to be Pr fA j B g D Pr fA \\ B g Pr fB g (C.16) whenever Pr fB g ¤ 0. (Read <Pr fA j B g= as <the probability of A given B .=) The idea behind equation (C.16) is that since we are given that event B occurs, the event that A also occurs is A \\ B . That is, A \\ B is the set of outcomes in which both A and B occur. Because the outcome is one of the elementary events in B , we normalize the probabilities of all the elementary events in B by dividing them by Pr fB g, so that they sum to 1. The conditional probability of A given B is, therefore, the ratio of the probability of event A \\ B to the probability of event B . In the example above, A is the event that both coins are heads, and B is the event that at least one coin is a head. Thus, Pr fA j B g D .1=4/=.3=4/ D 1=3. 1188 Appendix C Counting and Probability Two events are independent if Pr fA \\ B g D Pr fAg Pr fB g ; (C.17) which is equivalent, if Pr fB g ¤ 0, to the condition Pr fA j B g D Pr fAg : For example, suppose that you üip two fair coins and that the outcomes are inde- pendent. Then the probability of two heads is .1=2/.1=2/ D 1=4. Now suppose that one event is that the ûrst coin comes up heads and the other event is that the coins come up differently. Each of these events occurs with probability 1=2, and the probability that both events occur is 1=4. Thus, according to the deûnition of independence, the events are independent4even though you might think that both events depend on the ûrst coin. Finally, suppose that the coins are welded together so that they both fall heads or both fall tails and that the two possibilities are equally likely. Then the probability that each coin comes up heads is 1=2, but the probability that they both come up heads is 1=2 ¤ .1=2/.1=2/. Consequently, the event that one comes up heads and the event that the other comes up heads are not independent. A collection A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n of events is said to be pairwise independent if Pr fA i \\ A j g D Pr fA i g Pr fA j g for all 1 හ i < j හ n. We say that the events of the collection are (mutually) independent if every k-subset A i 1 ; A i 2 ; : : : ; A i k of the collection, where 2 හ k හ n and 1 හ i 1 < i 2 <    < i k හ n, satisûes Pr fA i 1 \\ A i 2 \\    \\ A i k g D Pr fA i 1 g Pr fA i 2 g    Pr fA i k g : For example, suppose that you üip two fair coins. Let A 1 be the event that the ûrst coin is heads, let A 2 be the event that the second coin is heads, and let A 3 be the event that the two coins are different. Then, Pr fA 1 g D 1=2 , Pr fA 2 g D 1=2 , Pr fA 3 g D 1=2 , Pr fA 1 \\ A 2 g D 1=4 , Pr fA 1 \\ A 3 g D 1=4 , Pr fA 2 \\ A 3 g D 1=4 , Pr fA 1 \\ A 2 \\ A 3 g D 0 . Since for 1 හ i < j හ 3, we have Pr fA i \\ A j g D Pr fA i g Pr fA j g D 1=4, the events A 1 , A 2 , and A 3 are pairwise independent. The events are not mutually inde- pendent, however, because Pr fA 1 \\ A 2 \\ A 3 g D 0 and Pr fA 1 g Pr fA 2 g Pr fA 3 g D 1=8 ¤ 0. C.2 Probability 1189 Bayes’s theorem From the deûnition (C.16) of conditional probability and the commutative law A \\ B D B \\ A, it follows that for two events A and B , each with nonzero prob- ability, Pr fA \\ B g D Pr fB g Pr fA j B g (C.18) D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag : Solving for Pr fA j B g, we obtain Pr fA j B g D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag Pr fB g ; (C.19) which is known as Bayes’s theorem. The denominator Pr fB g is a normalizing constant, which we can reformulate as follows. Since B D .B \\ A/ [ .B \\ A/, and since B \\ A and B \\ A are mutually exclusive events, Pr fB g D Pr fB \\ Ag C Pr ˚ B \\ A  D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag C Pr ˚ A  Pr ˚ B j A  : Substituting into equation (C.19) produces an equivalent form of Bayes’s theorem: Pr fA j B g D Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag Pr fAg Pr fB j Ag C Pr ˚ A  Pr ˚ B j A  : (C.20) Bayes’s theorem can simplify the computing of conditional probabilities. For example, suppose that you have a fair coin and a biased coin that always comes up heads. Run an experiment consisting of three independent events: choose one of the two coins at random, üip that coin once, and then üip it again. Suppose that the coin you have chosen comes up heads both times. What is the probability that it’s the biased coin? Bayes’s theorem solves this problem. Let A be the event that you choose the biased coin, and let B be the event that the chosen coin comes up heads both times. We wish to determine Pr fA j B g, knowing that Pr fAg D 1=2, Pr fB j Ag D 1, Pr ˚ A  D 1=2, and Pr ˚ B j A  D 1=4. Thus we have Pr fA j B g D .1=2/  1 .1=2/  1 C .1=2/  .1=4/ D 4=5 : 1190 Appendix C Counting and Probability Exercises C.2-1 Professor Rosencrantz üips a fair coin twice.

C.2-8 Professor Gore teaches a music class on rhythm in which three students4Jeff, Tim, and Carmine4are in danger of failing. Professor Gore tells the three that one of C.3 Discrete random variables 1191 them will pass the course and the other two will fail. Carmine asks Professor Gore privately which of Jeff and Tim will fail, arguing that since he already knows at least one of them will fail, the professor won’t be revealing any information about Carmine’s outcome. In a breach of privacy law, Professor Gore tells Carmine that Jeff will fail. Carmine feels somewhat relieved now, ûguring that either he or Tim will pass, so that his probability of passing is now 1=2. Is Carmine correct, or is his chance of passing still 1=3? Explain. C.3 Discrete random variables A (discrete) random variable X is a function from a ûnite or countably inûnite sample space S to the real numbers. It associates a real number with each possible outcome of an experiment, which allows us to work with the probability distri- bution induced on the resulting set of numbers. Random variables can also be deûned for uncountably inûnite sample spaces, but they raise technical issues that are unnecessary to address for our purposes. Therefore we’ll assume that random variables are discrete. For a random variable X and a real number x , we deûne the event X D x to be fs 2 S W X.s/ D x g, and thus Pr fX D x g D X s2S WX.s/Dx Pr fs g : The function f .x/ D Pr fX D x g is the probability density function of the random variable X . From the probability axioms, Pr fX D x g  0 and P x Pr fX D x g D 1. As an example, consider the experiment of rolling a pair of ordinary, 6-sided dice. There are 36 possible outcomes in the sample space. Assume that the probability distribution is uniform, so that each outcome s 2 S is equally likely: Pr fs g D 1=36. Deûne the random variable X to be the maximum of the two values showing on the dice. We have Pr fX D 3g D 5=36, since X assigns a value of 3 to 5 of the 36 possible outcomes, namely, .1; 3/, .2; 3/, .3; 3/, .3; 2/, and .3; 1/. We can deûne several random variables on the same sample space. If X and Y are random variables, the function f .x; y/ D Pr fX D x and Y D y g is the joint probability density function of X and Y . For a ûxed value y , 1192 Appendix C Counting and Probability Pr fY D y g D X x Pr fX D x and Y D y g ; and similarly, for a ûxed value x , Pr fX D x g D X y Pr fX D x and Y D y g : Using the deûnition (C.16) of conditional probability on page 1187, we have Pr fX D x j Y D y g D Pr fX D x and Y D y g Pr fY D y g : We deûne two random variables X and Y to be independent if for all x and y , the events X D x and Y D y are independent or, equivalently, if for all x and y , we have Pr fX D x and Y D y g D Pr fX D x g Pr fY D y g. Given a set of random variables deûned over the same sample space, we can deûne new random variables as sums, products, or other functions of the original variables. Expected value of a random variable The simplest, and often the most useful, summary of the distribution of a random variable is the <average= of the values it takes on. The expected value (or, synony- mously, expectation or mean) of a discrete random variable X is E ŒX � D X x x  Pr fX D x g ; (C.23) which is well deûned if the sum is ûnite or converges absolutely. Sometimes the expectation of X is denoted by � X or, when the random variable is apparent from context, simply by �. Consider a game in which you üip two fair coins. You earn $3 for each head but lose $2 for each tail. The expected value of the random variable X representing your earnings is E ŒX � D 6  Pr f2 H’sg C 1  Pr f1 H, 1 Tg  4  Pr f2 T’sg D 6  .1=4/ C 1  .1=2/  4  .1=4/ D 1 : Linearity of expectation says that the expectation of the sum of two random variables is the sum of their expectations, that is, E ŒX C Y � D E ŒX � C E ŒY � ; (C.24) C.3 Discrete random variables 1193 whenever E ŒX � and E ŒY � are deûned. Linearity of expectation applies to a broad range of situations, holding even when X and Y are not independent. It also ex- tends to ûnite and absolutely convergent summations of expectations. Linearity of expectation is the key property that enables us to perform probabilistic analyses by using indicator random variables (see Section 5.2). If X is any random variable, any function g.x/ deûnes a new random vari- able g.X /. If the expectation of g.X / is deûned, then E Œg.X /� D X x g.x/  Pr fX D x g : Letting g.x/ D ax , we have for any constant a, E ŒaX � D aE ŒX � : (C.25) Consequently, expectations are linear: for any two random variables X and Y and any constant a, E ŒaX C Y � D aE ŒX � C E ŒY � : (C.26) When two random variables X and Y are independent and each has a deûned expectation, E ŒX Y � D X x X y xy  Pr fX D x and Y D y g D X x X y xy  Pr fX D x g Pr fY D y g (by independence of X and Y ) D  X x x  Pr fX D x g !  X y y  Pr fY D y g ! D E ŒX � E ŒY � (by equation (C.23)) . In general, when n random variables X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X n are mutually independent, E ŒX 1 X 2    X n � D E ŒX 1 � E ŒX 2 �    E ŒX n � : (C.27) When a random variable X takes on values from the set of natural numbers N D f0; 1; 2; : : :g, we have a nice formula for its expectation: E ŒX � D 1 X i D0 i  Pr fX D i g D 1 X i D0 i  .Pr fX  i g  Pr fX  i C 1g/ D 1 X i D1 Pr fX  i g ; (C.28) 1194 Appendix C Counting and Probability since each term Pr fX  i g is added in i times and subtracted out i  1 times (except Pr fX  0g, which is added in 0 times and not subtracted out at all). A function f .x/ is convex if f .�x C .1  �/y/ හ �f .x/ C .1  �/f .y/ (C.29) for all x and y and for all 0 හ � හ 1. Jensen’s inequality says that when a convex function f .x/ is applied to a random variable X , E Œf .X /�  f .E ŒX �/ ; (C.30) provided that the expectations exist and are ûnite. Variance and standard deviation The expected value of a random variable does not express how <spread out= the variable’s values are. For example, consider random variables X and Y for which Pr fX D 1=4g D Pr fX D 3=4g D 1=2 and Pr fY D 0g D Pr fY D 1g D 1=2. Then both E ŒX � and E ŒY � are 1=2, yet the actual values taken on by Y are further from the mean than the actual values taken on by X . The notion of variance mathematically expresses how far from the mean a ran- dom variable’s values are likely to be. The variance of a random variable X with mean E ŒX � is Var ŒX � D E í .X  E ŒX �/ 2 î D E í X 2  2X E ŒX � C E 2 ŒX � î D E ŒX 2 �  2E ŒX E ŒX �� C E 2 ŒX � D E ŒX 2 �  2E 2 ŒX � C E 2 ŒX � D E ŒX 2 �  E 2 ŒX � : (C.31) To justify the equation E ŒE 2 ŒX �� D E 2 ŒX �, note that because E ŒX � is a real num- ber and not a random variable, so is E 2 ŒX �. The equation E ŒX E ŒX �� D E 2 ŒX � follows from equation (C.25), with a D E ŒX �. Rewriting equation (C.31) yields an expression for the expectation of the square of a random variable: E ŒX 2 � D Var ŒX � C E 2 ŒX � : (C.32) The variance of a random variable X and the variance of aX are related (see Exercise C.3-10): Var ŒaX � D a 2 Var ŒX � : When X and Y are independent random variables, Var ŒX C Y � D Var ŒX � C Var ŒY � : C.3 Discrete random variables 1195 In general, if n random variables X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X n are pairwise independent, then Var \" n X i D1 X i # D n X i D1 Var ŒX i � : (C.33) The standard deviation of a random variable X is the nonnegative square root of the variance of X . The standard deviation of a random variable X is sometimes denoted � X or simply � when the random variable X is understood from context. With this notation, the variance of X is denoted � 2 .

C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions A Bernoulli trial is an experiment with only two possible outcomes: success, which occurs with probability p, and failure, which occurs with probability q D 1  p. A coin üip serves as an example where, depending on your point of view, heads equates to success and tails to failure. When we speak of Bernoulli trials collectively, we mean that the trials are mutually independent and, unless we speciûcally say otherwise, that each has the same probability p for success. Two important distributions arise from Bernoulli trials: the geometric distribution and the binomial distribution. The geometric distribution Consider a sequence of Bernoulli trials, each with a probability p of success and a probability q D 1  p of failure. How many trials occur before a success? Deûne the random variable X to be the number of trials needed to obtain a success. Then X has values in the range f1; 2; : : :g, and for k  1, C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions 1197 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0.30 0.35 k Î 2 3 Ï k1 Î 1 3 Ï Figure C.1 A geometric distribution with probability p D 1=3 of success and a probability q D 1  p of failure. The expectation of the distribution is 1=p D 3. Pr fX D kg D q k1 p ; (C.35) since k  1 failures occur before the ûrst success. A probability distribution satis- fying equation (C.35) is said to be a geometric distribution. Figure C.1 illustrates such a distribution. Assuming that q < 1, we can calculate the expectation of a geometric distribu- tion: E ŒX � D 1 X kD1 kq k1 p D p q 1 X kD0 kq k D p q  q .1  q/ 2 (by equation (A.11) on page 1142) D p q  q p 2 D 1=p : (C.36) 1198 Appendix C Counting and Probability Thus, on average, it takes 1=p trials before a success occurs, an intuitive result. As Exercise C.4-3 asks you to show, the variance is Var ŒX � D q=p 2 : (C.37) As an example, suppose that you repeatedly roll two dice until you obtain either a seven or an eleven. Of the 36 possible outcomes, 6 yield a seven and 2 yield an eleven. Thus, the probability of success is p D 8=36 D 2=9, and you’d have to roll 1=p D 9=2 D 4:5 times on average to obtain a seven or eleven. The binomial distribution How many successes occur during n Bernoulli trials, where a success occurs with probability p and a failure with probability q D 1  p? Deûne the random vari- able X to be the number of successes in n trials. Then X has values in the range f0; 1; : : : ; ng, and for k D 0; 1; : : : ; n, Pr fX D kg D  n k ! p k q nk ; (C.38) since there are ã n k ä ways to pick which k of the n trials are successes, and the probability that each occurs is p k q nk . A probability distribution satisfying equa- tion (C.38) is said to be a binomial distribution. For convenience, we deûne the family of binomial distributions using the notation b.kI n; p/ D  n k ! p k .1  p/ nk : (C.39) Figure C.2 illustrates a binomial distribution. The name <binomial= comes from the right-hand side of equation (C.38) being the kth term of the expansion of .p C q/ n . Consequently, since p C q D 1, equation (C.4) on page 1181 gives n X kD0 b.kI n; p/ D 1 ; (C.40) as axiom 2 of the probability axioms requires. We can compute the expectation of a random variable having a binomial distri- bution from equations (C.9) and (C.40). Let X be a random variable that follows the binomial distribution b.kI n; p/, and let q D 1  p. The deûnition of expecta- tion gives C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions 1199 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 k 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 b (k; 15, 1/3) Figure C.2 The binomial distribution b.kI 15; 1=3/ resulting from n D 15 Bernoulli trials, each with probability p D 1=3 of success.

(C.41) Linearity of expectation produces the same result with substantially less algebra. Let X i be the random variable describing the number of successes in the i th trial. Then E ŒX i � D p  1 C q  0 D p, and the expected number of successes for n trials is 1200 Appendix C Counting and Probability E ŒX � D E \" n X i D1 X i # D n X i D1 E ŒX i � (by equation (C.24) on page 1192) D n X i D1 p D np : (C.42) We can use the same approach to calculate the variance of the distribution. By equation (C.31), Var ŒX i � D E ŒX 2 i �  E 2 ŒX i �. Since X i takes on only the values 0 and 1, we have X 2 i D X i , which implies E ŒX 2 i � D E ŒX i � D p. Hence, Var ŒX i � D p  p 2 D p.1  p/ D pq : (C.43) To compute the variance of X , we take advantage of the independence of the n trials. By equation (C.33), we have Var ŒX � D Var \" n X i D1 X i # D n X i D1 Var ŒX i � D n X i D1 pq D npq : (C.44) As Figure C.2 shows, the binomial distribution b.kI n; p/ increases with k until it reaches the mean np, and then it decreases. To prove that the distribution always behaves in this manner, examine the ratio of successive terms: b.kI n; p/ b.k  1I n; p/ D ã n k ä p k q nk ã n k1 ä p k1 q nkC1 D nŠ .k  1/Š .n  k C 1/Š p kŠ .n  k/Š nŠ q D .n  k C 1/p kq (C.45) D 1 C .n  k C 1/p  kq kq D 1 C .n  k C 1/p  k.1  p/ kq C.4 The geometric and binomial distributions 1201 D 1 C .n C 1/p  k kq : This ratio is greater than 1 precisely when .n C 1/p  k is positive. Consequently, b.kI n; p/ > b.k  1I n; p/ for k < .n C 1/p (the distribution increases), and b.kI n; p/ < b.k  1I n; p/ for k > .n C 1/p (the distribution decreases). If .n C 1/p is an integer, then for k D .n C 1/p, the ratio b.kI n; p/=b.k  1I n; p/ equals 1, so that b.kI n; p/ D b.k  1I n; p/. In this case, the distribution has two maxima: at k D .nC1/p and at k 1 D .nC1/p1 D npq. Otherwise, it attains a maximum at the unique integer k that lies in the range np  q < k < .n C 1/p. The following lemma provides an upper bound on the binomial distribution. Lemma C.1 Let n  0, let 0 < p < 1, let q D 1  p, and let 0 හ k හ n.

C.5 The tails of the binomial distribution 1203 ? C.5 The tails of the binomial distribution The probability of having at least, or at most, k successes in n Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success, is often of more interest than the probability of having exactly k successes. In this section, we investigate the tails of the binomial distribution: the two regions of the distribution b.kI n; p/ that are far from the mean np. We’ll prove several important bounds on (the sum of all terms in) a tail. We ûrst provide a bound on the right tail of the distribution b.kI n; p/. To deter- mine bounds on the left tail, simply invert the roles of successes and failures. Theorem C.2 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p.

Then for 0 හ k හ n, the probability of at least k successes is Pr fX  kg D n X i Dk b.i I n; p/ හ  n k ! p k : Proof For S ෂ f1; 2; : : : ; ng, let A S denote the event that the i th trial is a success for every i 2 S .

In general, we’ll leave it to you to adapt the proofs from one tail to the other. Corollary C.3 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probabil- ity p. If X is the random variable denoting the total number of successes, then for 0 හ k හ n, the probability of at most k successes is 1204 Appendix C Counting and Probability Pr fX හ kg D k X i D0 b.i I n; p/ හ  n n  k ! .1  p/ nk D  n k ! .1  p/ nk : Our next bound concerns the left tail of the binomial distribution. Its corollary shows that, far from the mean, the left tail diminishes exponentially. Theorem C.4 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p and failure with probability q D 1  p. Let X be the random variable denoting the total number of successes. Then for 0 < k < np , the probability of fewer than k successes is Pr fX < kg D k1 X i D0 b.i I n; p/ < kq np  k b.kI n; p/ : Proof We bound the series P k1 i D0 b.i I n; p/ by a geometric series using the tech- nique from Section A.2, page 1147.

Iteratively applying this inequality k  i times gives b.i I n; p/ < x ki b.kI n; p/ for 0 හ i < k, and hence k1 X i D0 b.i I n; p/ < k1 X i D0 x ki b.kI n; p/ < b.k I n; p/ 1 X i D1 x i D x 1  x b.kI n; p/ D kq=..n  k/p/ ..n  k/p  kq/=..n  k/p/ b.kI n; p/ D kq np  kp  kq b.kI n; p/ D kq np  k b.kI n; p/ : Corollary C.5 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p and failure with probability q D 1  p. Then for 0 < k හ np=2, the probability of fewer than k successes is less than half the probability of fewer than k C 1 successes. Proof Because k හ np=2, we have kq np  k හ .np=2/q np  .np=2/ D .np=2/q np=2 හ 1 ; (C.46) since q හ 1. Letting X be the random variable denoting the number of successes, Theorem C.4 and inequality (C.46) imply that the probability of fewer than k suc- cesses is 1206 Appendix C Counting and Probability Pr fX < kg D k1 X i D0 b.i I n; p/ < b.kI n; p/ : Thus we have Pr fX < kg Pr fX < k C 1g D P k1 i D0 b.i I n; p/ P k i D0 b.i I n; p/ D P k1 i D0 b.i I n; p/ P k1 i D0 b.i I n; p/ C b.kI n; p/ < 1=2 ; since P k1 i D0 b.i I n; p/ < b.kI n; p/. Bounds on the right tail follow similarly. Exercise C.5-2 asks you to prove them. Corollary C.6 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p. Let X be the random variable denoting the total number of successes. Then for np < k < n, the probability of more than k successes is Pr fX > kg D n X i DkC1 b.i I n; p/ < .n  k/p k  np b.kI n; p/ : Corollary C.7 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where success occurs with probability p and failure with probability q D 1  p. Then for .np C n/=2 < k < n , the probability of more than k successes is less than half the probability of more than k  1 successes. The next theorem considers n Bernoulli trials, each with a probability p i of success, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. As the subsequent corollary shows, we can use the theorem to provide a bound on the right tail of the binomial distribution by setting p i D p for each trial. Theorem C.8 Consider a sequence of n Bernoulli trials, where in the i th trial, for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n, success occurs with probability p i and failure occurs with probability q i D 1  p i .

Problems C-1 The Monty Hall problem Imagine that you are a contestant in the 1960s game show Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by emcee Monty Hall. A valuable prize is hidden behind one of three doors and comparatively worthless prizes behind the other two doors. You will win the valuable prize, typically an automobile or other expensive product, if you select the correct door. After you have picked one door, but before the door has been opened, Monty, who knows which door hides the automobile, directs his assistant Carol Merrill to open one of the other doors, revealing a goat (not a valuable prize). He asks whether you would like to stick with your current choice or to switch to the other closed door. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the automobile and not the other goat? The answer to this question4stick or switch?4has been heavily debated, in part because the problem setup is ambiguous. We’ll explore different subtle assump- tions. a. Suppose that your ûrst pick is random, with probability 1=3 of choosing the right door. Moreover, you know that Monty always gives every contestant (and will give you) the opportunity to switch. Prove that it is better to switch than stick. What is your probability of winning the automobile? This answer is the one typically given, even though the original statement of the problem rarely mentions the assumption that Monty always offers the contestant the opportunity to switch. But, as the remainder of this problem will elucidate, your best strategy may be different if this unstated assumption does not hold. In Problems for Appendix C 1211 fact, in the real game show, after a contestant picked a door, Monty sometimes simply asked Carol to open the door that the contestant had chosen. Let’s model the interactions between you and Monty as a probabilistic experi- ment, where you both employ randomized strategies. Speciûcally, after you pick a door, Monty offers you the opportunity to switch with probability p right if you picked the right door and with probability p wrong if you picked the wrong door. Given the opportunity to switch, you randomly choose to switch with probabil- ity p switch . For example, if Monty always offers you the opportunity to switch, then his strategy is given by p right D p wrong D 1. If you always switch, then your strategy is given by p switch D 1. The game can now be viewed as an experiment consisting of ûve steps: 1. You pick a door at random, choosing the automobile (right) with probability 1=3 or a goat (wrong) with probability 2=3. 2. Carol opens one of the two closed doors, revealing a goat. 3. Monty offers you the opportunity to switch with probability p right if your choice is right and with probability p wrong if your choice is wrong. 4. If Monty makes you an offer in step 3, you switch with probability p switch . 5. Carol opens the door you’ve chosen, revealing either an automobile (you win) or a goat (you lose). Let’s now analyze this game and understand how the choices of p right , p wrong , and p switch inüuence the probability of winning. b. What are the six outcomes in the sample space for this game? Which outcomes correspond to you winning the automobile? What are the probabilities in terms of p right , p wrong , and p switch of each outcome? Organize your answers into a table. c. Use the results of your table (or other means) to prove that the probability of winning the automobile is 1 3 .2p wrong p switch  p right p switch C 1/ : Suppose that Monty knows the probability p switch that you switch, and his goal is to minimize your chance of winning. d. If p switch > 0 (you switch with a positive probability), what is Monty’s best strategy, that is, his best choice for p right and p wrong ? e. If p switch D 0 (you always stick), argue that all of Monty’s possible strategies are optimal for him. 1212 Appendix C Counting and Probability Suppose that now Monty’s strategy is ûxed, with particular values for p right and p wrong . f. If you know p right and p wrong , what is your best strategy for choosing your prob- ability p switch of switching as a function of p right and p wrong ? g. If you don’t know p right and p wrong , what choice of p switch maximizes the mini- mum probability of winning over all the choices of p right and p wrong ? Let’s return to the original problem as stated, where Monty has given you the option of switching, but you have no knowledge of Monty’s possible motivations or strategies. h. Argue that the conditional probability of winning the automobile given that Monty offers you the opportunity to switch is p right  p right p switch C 2p wrong p switch p right C 2p wrong : (C.52) Explain why p right C 2p wrong ¤ 0. i. What is the value of expression (C.52) when p switch D 1=2? Show that choosing p switch < 1=2 or p switch > 1=2 allows Monty to select values for p right and p wrong that yield a lower value for expression (C.52) than choosing p switch D 1=2. j. Suppose that you don’t know Monty’s strategy. Explain why choosing to switch with probability 1=2 is a good strategy for the original problem as stated. Sum- marize what you have learned overall from this problem. C-2 Balls and bins This problem investigates the effect of various assumptions on the number of ways of placing n balls into b distinct bins. a. Suppose that the n balls are distinct and that their order within a bin does not matter. Argue that the number of ways of placing the balls in the bins is b n . b. Suppose that the balls are distinct and that the balls in each bin are ordered. Prove that there are exactly .b C n  1/Š=.b  1/Š ways to place the balls in the bins. (Hint: Consider the number of ways of arranging n distinct balls and b  1 indistinguishable sticks in a row.) c. Suppose that the balls are identical, and hence their order within a bin does not matter. Show that the number of ways of placing the balls in the bins is ã bCn1 n ä . (Hint: Of the arrangements in part (b), how many are repeated if the balls are made identical?) Notes for Appendix C 1213 d. Suppose that the balls are identical and that no bin may contain more than one ball, so that n හ b. Show that the number of ways of placing the balls is ã b n ä . e. Suppose that the balls are identical and that no bin may be left empty. Assuming that n  b, show that the number of ways of placing the balls is ã n1 b1 ä . Appendix notes The ûrst general methods for solving probability problems were discussed in a famous correspondence between B. Pascal and P. de Fermat, which began in 1654, and in a book by C. Huygens in 1657. Rigorous probability theory began with the work of J. Bernoulli in 1713 and A. De Moivre in 1730. Further developments of the theory were provided by P.-S. Laplace, S.-D. Poisson, and C. F. Gauss. Sums of random variables were originally studied by P. L. Chebyshev and A. A. Markov. A. N. Kolmogorov axiomatized probability theory in 1933. Chernoff [91] and Hoeffding [222] provided bounds on the tails of distributions. Seminal work in random combinatorial structures was done by P. Erd˝ os. Knuth [259] and Liu [302] are good references for elementary combinatorics and counting. Standard textbooks such as Billingsley [56], Chung [93], Drake [125], Feller [139], and Rozanov [390] offer comprehensive introductions to probability. D Matrices Matrices arise in numerous applications, including, but by no means limited to, scientiûc computing. If you have seen matrices before, much of the material in this appendix will be familiar to you, but some of it might be new. Section D.1 covers basic matrix deûnitions and operations, and Section D.2 presents some basic matrix properties. D.1 Matrices and matrix operations This section reviews some basic concepts of matrix theory and some fundamental properties of matrices. Matrices and vectors A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. For example, A D Î a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 Ï D Î 1 2 3 4 5 6 Ï (D.1) is a 2  3 matrix A D .a ij /, where for i D 1; 2 and j D 1; 2; 3, the element of the matrix in row i and column j is denoted by a ij . By convention, uppercase letters denote matrices and corresponding subscripted lowercase letters denote their elements. We denote the set of all m  n matrices with real-valued entries by R mn and, in general, the set of m  n matrices with entries drawn from a set S by S mn . The transpose of a matrix A is the matrix A T obtained by exchanging the rows and columns of A. For the matrix A of equation (D.1), D.1 Matrices and matrix operations 1215 A T D ã 1 4 2 5 3 6 ä : A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. For example, x D ã 2 3 5 ä is a vector of size 3. We sometimes call a vector of length n an n-vector. By con- vention, lowercase letters denote vectors, and the i th element of a size-n vector x is denoted by x i , for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n. We take the standard form of a vector to be as a column vector equivalent to an n  1 matrix, whereas the corresponding row vector is obtained by taking the transpose: x T D . 2 3 5 / : The unit vector e i is the vector whose i th element is 1 and all of whose other elements are 0. Usually, the context makes the size of a unit vector clear. A zero matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are 0. Such a matrix is often denoted 0, since the ambiguity between the number 0 and a matrix of 0s can usually be resolved from context. If a matrix of 0s is intended, then the size of the matrix also needs to be derived from the context. Square matrices Square n  n matrices arise frequently. Several special cases of square matrices are of particular interest: 1. A diagonal matrix has a ij D 0 whenever i ¤ j . Because all of the off-diagonal elements are 0, a succinct way to specify the matrix lists only the elements along the diagonal: diag.a 11 ; a 22 ; : : : ; a nn / D ˙ a 11 0 : : : 0 0 a 22 : : : 0 : : : : : : : : : : : : 0 0 : : : a nn  : 2. The n  n identity matrix I n is a diagonal matrix with 1s along the diagonal: I n D diag.1; 1; : : : ; 1/ D ˙ 1 0 : : : 0 0 1 : : : 0 : : : : : : : : : : : : 0 0 : : : 1  : 1216 Appendix D Matrices When I appears without a subscript, its size derives from the context. The i th column of an identity matrix is the unit vector e i . 3. A tridiagonal matrix T is one for which t ij D 0 if ji  j j > 1. Nonzero entries appear only on the main diagonal, immediately above the main diagonal (t i;i C1 for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1), or immediately below the main diagonal (t i C1;i for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n  1): T D  t 11 t 12 0 0 : : : 0 0 0 t 21 t 22 t 23 0 : : : 0 0 0 0 t 32 t 33 t 34 : : : 0 0 0 : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 0 0 0 0 : : : t n2;n2 t n2;n1 0 0 0 0 0 : : : t n1;n2 t n1;n1 t n1;n 0 0 0 0 : : : 0 t n;n1 t nn ˘ : 4. An upper-triangular matrix U is one for which u ij D 0 if i > j . All entries below the diagonal are 0: U D ˙ u 11 u 12 : : : u 1n 0 u 22 : : : u 2n : : : : : : : : : : : : 0 0 : : : u nn  : An upper-triangular matrix is unit upper-triangular if it has all 1s along the diagonal. 5. A lower-triangular matrix L is one for which l ij D 0 if i < j . All entries above the diagonal are 0: L D ˙ l 11 0 : : : 0 l 21 l 22 : : : 0 : : : : : : : : : : : : l n1 l n2 : : : l nn  : A lower-triangular matrix is unit lower-triangular if it has all 1s along the diagonal. D.1 Matrices and matrix operations 1217 6. A permutation matrix P has exactly one 1 in each row or column, and 0s elsewhere. An example of a permutation matrix is D ˇ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0  : Such a matrix is called a permutation matrix because multiplying a vector x by a permutation matrix has the effect of permuting (rearranging) the elements of x . Exercise D.1-4 explores additional properties of permutation matrices. 7. A symmetric matrix A satisûes the condition A D A T . For example, ã 1 2 3 2 6 4 3 4 5 ä is a symmetric matrix. Basic matrix operations The elements of a matrix or vector are scalar numbers from a number system, such as the real numbers, the complex numbers, or integers modulo a prime. The number system deûnes how to add and multiply scalars. These deûnitions extend to encompass addition and multiplication of matrices. We deûne matrix addition as follows. If A D .a ij / and B D .b ij / are m  n matrices, then their matrix sum C D .c ij / D A C B is the m  n matrix deûned by c ij D a ij C b ij for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m and j D 1; 2; : : : ; n. That is, matrix addition is performed componentwise. A zero matrix is the identity for matrix addition: A C 0 D A D 0 C A : If � is a scalar number and A D .a ij / is a matrix, then �A D .�a ij / is the scalar multiple of A obtained by multiplying each of its elements by �. As a special case, we deûne the negative of a matrix A D .a ij / to be 1  A D A, so that the ij th entry of A is a ij . Thus, A C .A/ D 0 D .A/ C A : 1218 Appendix D Matrices The negative of a matrix deûnes matrix subtraction: A  B D A C .B/. We deûne matrix multiplication as follows. Start with two matrices A and B that are compatible in the sense that the number of columns of A equals the number of rows of B . (In general, an expression containing a matrix product AB is always assumed to imply that matrices A and B are compatible.) If A D .a i k / is a p  q matrix and B D .b kj / is a q  r matrix, then their matrix product C D AB is the p  r matrix C D .c ij /, where c ij D q X kD1 a i k b kj (D.2) for i D 1; 2; : : : ; m and j D 1; 2; : : : ; p. The procedure RECTANGULAR- MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 374 implements matrix multiplication in the straight- forward manner based on equation (D.2), assuming that C is initialized to 0, using pqr multiplications and p.q  1/r additions for a running time of ‚.pqr/. If the matrices are nn square matrices, so that n D p D q D r , the pseudocode reduces to MATRIX-MULTIPLY on page 81, whose running time is ‚.n 3 /. (Section 4.2 de- scribes an asymptotically faster ‚.n lg 7 /-time algorithm due to V. Strassen.) Matrices have many (but not all) of the algebraic properties typical of numbers. Identity matrices are identities for matrix multiplication: I m A D AI n D A for any m  n matrix A. Multiplying by a zero matrix gives a zero matrix: A  0 D 0 : Matrix multiplication is associative: A.BC / D .AB/C for compatible matrices A, B , and C . Matrix multiplication distributes over addi- tion: A.B C C / D AB C AC ; .B C C /D D BD C CD : For n > 1, multiplication of n  n matrices is not commutative. For example, if A D Î 0 1 0 0 Ï and B D Î 0 0 1 0 Ï , then AB D Î 1 0 0 0 Ï and BA D Î 0 0 0 1 Ï . We deûne matrix-vector products or vector-vector products as if the vector were the equivalent n  1 matrix (or a 1  n matrix, in the case of a row vector). Thus, if A is an m  n matrix and x is an n-vector, then Ax is an m-vector. If x and y are n-vectors, then D.2 Basic matrix properties 1219 x T y D n X i D1 x i y i is a scalar number (actually a 1  1 matrix) called the inner product of x and y . We also use the notation hx; y i to denote x T y . The inner-product operator is com- mutative: hx; y i D hy; x i. The matrix xy T is an n  n matrix Z called the outer product of x and y , where ´ ij D x i y j . The (euclidean) norm kx k of an n-vector x is deûned by kx k D .x 2 1 C x 2 2 C    C x 2 n / 1=2 D .x T x/ 1=2 : Thus, the norm of x is its length in n-dimensional euclidean space. A useful fact, which follows from the equality .ax 1 / 2 C .ax 2 / 2 C    C .ax n / 2 ä 1=2 D jaj .x 2 1 C x 2 2 C    C x 2 n / 1=2 is that for any real number a and n-vector x , kax k D jaj kx k : (D.3) Exercises D.1-1 Show that if A and B are symmetric n  n matrices, then so are A C B and A  B . D.1-2 Prove that .AB/ T D B T A T and that A T A is always a symmetric matrix. D.1-3 Prove that the product of two lower-triangular matrices is lower-triangular. D.1-4 Prove that if P is an n  n permutation matrix and A is an n  n matrix, then the matrix product PA is A with its rows permuted, and the matrix product AP is A with its columns permuted. Prove that the product of two permutation matrices is a permutation matrix. D.2 Basic matrix properties We now deûne some basic properties pertaining to matrices: inverses, linear de- pendence and independence, rank, and determinants. We also deûne the class of positive-deûnite matrices. 1220 Appendix D Matrices Matrix inverses, ranks, and determinants The inverse of an n  n matrix A is the n  n matrix, denoted A 1 (if it exists), such that AA 1 D I n D A 1 A. For example, Î 1 1 1 0 Ï 1 D Î 0 1 1 1 Ï : Many nonzero n  n matrices do not have inverses. A matrix without an inverse is called noninvertible, or singular. An example of a nonzero singular matrix is Î 1 0 1 0 Ï : If a matrix has an inverse, it is called invertible, or nonsingular. Matrix inverses, when they exist, are unique. (See Exercise D.2-1.) If A and B are nonsingular n  n matrices, then .BA/ 1 D A 1 B 1 : The inverse operation commutes with the transpose operation: .A 1 / T D .A T / 1 : The vectors x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n are linearly dependent if there exist coefûcients c 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c n , not all of which are 0, such that c 1 x 1 C c 2 x 2 C    C c n x n D 0. The row vectors x 1 D . 1 2 3 / , x 2 D . 2 6 4 / , and x 3 D . 4 11 9 / are lin- early dependent, for example, since 2x 1 C3x 2 2x 3 D 0. If vectors are not linearly dependent, they are linearly independent. For example, the columns of an identity matrix are linearly independent. The column rank of a nonzero m  n matrix A is the size of the largest set of linearly independent columns of A. Similarly, the row rank of A is the size of the largest set of linearly independent rows of A. A fundamental property of any matrix A is that its row rank always equals its column rank, so that we can simply refer to the rank of A. The rank of an m  n matrix is an integer between 0 and min fm; ng, inclusive. (The rank of a zero matrix is 0, and the rank of an n  n identity matrix is n.) An alternate, but equivalent and often more useful, deûnition is that the rank of a nonzero m  n matrix A is the smallest number r such that there exist matrices B and C of respective sizes m  r and r  n such that A D BC . A square n  n matrix has full rank if its rank is n. An m  n matrix has full column rank if its rank is n. The following theorem gives a fundamental property of ranks. Theorem D.1 A square matrix has full rank if and only if it is nonsingular. D.2 Basic matrix properties 1221 A null vector for a matrix A is a nonzero vector x such that Ax D 0. The following theorem (whose proof is left as Exercise D.2-7) and its corollary relate the notions of column rank and singularity to null vectors. Theorem D.2 A matrix has full column rank if and only if it does not have a null vector. Corollary D.3 A square matrix is singular if and only if it has a null vector. The ij th minor of an nn matrix A, for n > 1, is the .n1/ .n1/ matrix A Œij Ł obtained by deleting the i th row and j th column of A. The determinant of an n  n matrix A is deûned recursively in terms of its minors by det.A/ D ‚ a 11 if n D 1 ; n X j D1 .1/ 1Cj a 1j det.A Œ1j Ł / if n > 1 : The term .1/ i Cj det.A Œij Ł / is known as the cofactor of the element a ij . The following theorems, whose proofs are omitted, express fundamental prop- erties of the determinant. Theorem D.4 (Determinant properties) The determinant of a square matrix A has the following properties:  If any row or any column of A is zero, then det.A/ D 0.  The determinant of A is multiplied by � if the entries of any one row (or any one column) of A are all multiplied by �.  The determinant of A is unchanged if the entries in one row (respectively, col- umn) are added to those in another row (respectively, column).  The determinant of A equals the determinant of A T .  The determinant of A is multiplied by 1 if any two rows (or any two columns) are exchanged. Also, for any square matrices A and B , we have det.AB/ D det.A/ det.B/. Theorem D.5 An n  n matrix A is singular if and only if det.A/ D 0. 1222 Appendix D Matrices Positive-deﬁnite matrices Positive-deûnite matrices play an important role in many applications. An n  n matrix A is positive-deﬁnite if x T Ax > 0 for all n-vectors x ¤ 0. For example, the identity matrix is positive-deûnite, since if x D . x 1 x 2    x n / T is a nonzero vector, then T I n x D x T x D n X i D1 x 2 i > 0 : Matrices that arise in applications are often positive-deûnite due to the following theorem. Theorem D.6 For any matrix A with full column rank, the matrix A T A is positive-deûnite. Proof We must show that x T .A T A/x > 0 for any nonzero vector x . For any vector x , x T .A T A/x D .Ax/ T .Ax/ (by Exercise D.1-2) D kAx k 2 : The value kAx k 2 is just the sum of the squares of the elements of the vector Ax . Therefore, kAx k 2  0. We’ll show by contradiction that kAx k 2 > 0. Suppose that kAx k 2 D 0. Then, every element of Ax is 0, which is to say Ax D 0. Since A has full column rank, Theorem D.2 says that x D 0, which contradicts the requirement that x is nonzero. Hence, A T A is positive-deûnite. Section 28.3 explores other properties of positive-deûnite matrices. Section 33.3 uses a similar condition, known as positive-semideûnite. An n  n matrix A is positive-semideﬁnite if x T Ax  0 for all n-vectors x ¤ 0. Exercises D.2-1 Prove that matrix inverses are unique, that is, if B and C are inverses of A, then B D C . Problems for Appendix D 1223 D.2-2 Prove that the determinant of a lower-triangular or upper-triangular matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal elements. Prove that the inverse of a lower-triangular matrix, if it exists, is lower-triangular. D.2-3 Prove that if P is a permutation matrix, then P is invertible, its inverse is P T , and P T is a permutation matrix. D.2-4 Let A and B be n  n matrices such that AB D I . Prove that if A 0 is obtained from A by adding row j into row i , where i ¤ j , then subtracting column i from column j of B yields the inverse B 0 of A 0 . D.2-5 Let A be a nonsingular n  n matrix with complex entries. Show that every entry of A 1 is real if and only if every entry of A is real. D.2-6 Show that if A is a nonsingular, symmetric, n  n matrix, then A 1 is symmetric. Show that if B is an arbitrary m  n matrix, then the m  m matrix given by the product BAB T is symmetric. D.2-7 Prove Theorem D.2. That is, show that a matrix A has full column rank if and only if Ax D 0 implies x D 0. (Hint: Express the linear dependence of one column on the others as a matrix-vector equation.) D.2-8 Prove that for any two compatible matrices A and B , rank.AB/ හ min frank.A/; rank.B/g ; where equality holds if either A or B is a nonsingular square matrix. (Hint: Use the alternate deûnition of the rank of a matrix.)

D-2 Permutations deﬁned by matrix-vector multiplication over GF.2/ One class of permutations of the integers in the set S n D f0; 1; 2; : : : ; 2 n  1g is deûned by matrix multiplication over GF.2/, the Galois ûeld of two elements. For each integer x 2 S n , we view its binary representation as an n-bit vector â x 0 x 1 x 2 : : : x n1 ã ; where x D P n1 i D0 x i 2 i . If A is an n  n matrix in which each entry is either 0 or 1, then we can deûne a permutation mapping each value x 2 S n to the number whose binary representation is the matrix-vector product Ax . All this arithmetic is performed over GF.2/: all values are either 0 or 1, and with one exception, the usual rules of addition and multiplication apply. The exception is that 1 C 1 D 0. You can think of arithmetic over GF.2/ as being just like regular integer arithmetic, except that you use only the least-signiûcant bit. As an example, for S 2 D f0; 1; 2; 3g, the matrix A D Î 1 0 1 1 Ï deûnes the following permutation � A : � A .0/ D 0, � A .1/ D 3, � A .2/ D 2, � A .3/ D 1. To see why � A .3/ D 1, observe that, working in GF.2/, Problems for Appendix D 1225 A .3/ D Î 1 0 1 1 ÏÎ 1 1 Ï D Î 1  1 C 0  1 1  1 C 1  1 Ï D Î 1 0 Ï ; which is the binary representation of 1. For the remainder of this problem, we’ll work over GF.2/, and all matrix and vector entries will be 0 or 1. Deûne the rank of a 0-1 matrix (a matrix for which each entry is either 0 or 1) over GF.2/ the same as for a regular matrix, but with all arithmetic that determines linear independence performed over GF.2/. We deûne the range of an n  n 0-1 matrix A by R.A/ D fy W y D Ax for some x 2 S n g ; so that R.A/ is the set of numbers in S n that are produced by multiplying each value x 2 S n by A. a. If r is the rank of matrix A, prove that jR.A/j D 2 r . Conclude that A deûnes a permutation on S n only if A has full rank. For a given n  n matrix A and a given value y 2 R.A/, we deûne the preimage of y by P .A; y/ D fx W Ax D y g ; so that P .A; y/ is the set of values in S n that map to y when multiplied by A. b. If r is the rank of n  n matrix A and y 2 R.A/, prove that jP .A; y/j D 2 nr . Let 0 හ m හ n, and suppose that we partition the set S n into blocks of con- secutive numbers, where the i th block consists of the 2 m numbers i 2 m ; i 2 m C 1; i 2 m C 2; : : : ; .i C 1/2 m  1. For any subset S ෂ S n , deûne B.S; m/ to be the set of size-2 m blocks of S n containing some element of S . As an example, when n D 3, m D 1, and S D f1; 4; 5g, then B.S; m/ consists of blocks 0 (since 1 is in the 0th block) and 2 (since both 4 and 5 belong to block 2). c. Let r be the rank of the lower left .n  m/  m submatrix of A, that is, the matrix formed by taking the intersection of the bottom n  m rows and the leftmost m columns of A. Let S be any size-2 m block of S n , and let S 0 D fy W y D Ax for some x 2 S g. Prove that jB.S 0 ; m/j D 2 r and that for each block in B.S 0 ; m/, exactly 2 mr numbers in S map to that block. 1226 Appendix D Matrices Because multiplying the zero vector by any matrix yields a zero vector, the set of permutations of S n deûned by multiplying by n  n 0-1 matrices with full rank over GF.2/ cannot include all permutations of S n . Let’s extend the class of per- mutations deûned by matrix-vector multiplication to include an additive term, so that x 2 S n maps to Ax C c , where c is an n-bit vector and addition is performed over GF.2/. For example, when A D Î 1 0 1 1 Ï and D Î 0 1 Ï ; we get the following permutation � A;c : � A;c .0/ D 2, � A;c .1/ D 1, � A;c .2/ D 0, � A;c .3/ D 3. We call any permutation that maps x 2 S n to Ax C c , for some n  n 0-1 matrix A with full rank and some n-bit vector c , a linear permutation. d. Use a counting argument to show that the number of linear permutations of S n is much less than the number of permutations of S n . e. Give an example of a value of n and a permutation of S n that cannot be achieved by any linear permutation. (Hint: For a given permutation, think about how multiplying a matrix by a unit vector relates to the columns of the matrix.)
