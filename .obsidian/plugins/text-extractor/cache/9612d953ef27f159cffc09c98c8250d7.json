Thus the graph representation of a finite automaton M that accepts the given language, i.e. L = L(M) is given below . 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 q0 q00 q01 q010 q10 q11 q101 Its states' equivalence classes are the following. □ Kl[q0] = Lλ Kl[q00] = {0w00 ∣ w ∈ Σ∗} ∪ {0, 00} Kl[q01] = {0w1 ∣ w ∈ Σ∗} Kl[q010] = Kl[q01] ⋅ {0} Kl[q10] = {1w0 ∣ w ∈ Σ∗} ∪ {1} Kl[q101] = Kl[q10] ⋅ {1} Kl[q11] = Kl[q101] ⋅ {1} 11 We define two partial finite automata M1, M2, such that L = L(M1) ∪ L(M2). The partial automata are defined over the same input alphabet Σ = {a, b}. The graph representation of M1 is as follows. a, b a, b a, b a, b q0 q1 q2 q3 With its states' equivalence classes being defined as below . For the second partial automaton, M2 its graph representation is this. a a a b b b q0 q1 q2 And the classes on its states are then this. Kl[q0] = Lλ Kl[q1] = Σ1 Kl[q2] = Σ2 Kl[q3] = Σ3 ⋅ Σ∗ The graph representation of the product automaton M is given below . □ Kl[q0] = {b}∗ ∪ {w ∈ Σ∗ ∣ |w|a ≡3 0} Kl[q1] = Kl[q0] ⋅ {a} ⋅ {b}∗ Kl[q3] = Σ∗ − (Kl[q0] ∪ Kl[q1]) 12 Assume L1 is regular. Then there exists a finite automaton A = (Q, {a, b, c}, δ, q0, F ) where L(A) = L1. Let’s observe the words ab, ab2, . . . , ab|Q|+1. According to the pigeonhole principle there exists some i, j ∈ {1, . . . , |Q| + 1} with i < j, where δ(q0, abi) = δ(q0, abj). From lemma 3.3 now follows that for all z ∈ {a, b, c}∗ Fixing z = bai shows that creating a contradiction and proving that L1 cannot be regular . Assuming L2 is regular. The pumping lemma states that there exists some constant n0 ∈ N that fulfills requirements (i) − (iii). Let‘s pick the word w = an0aban0 ∈ L2. Since |w| = (n0 + 2 + n0) ≥ n0, we can decompose w = yxz where abiz ∈ L1 ⟺ abjz ∈ L1 abiz ∈ L1 abjz ∉ L1 (i) |yx| ≤ n0 (ii) |x| ≥ 1 This means that yx is fully in (a)n0 ⟹ y = am ∧ x = al for some m + l ≤ n0 ∧ 1 ≤ l. If we pump x we get following words below . This contradicts (iii) and proves that L2 is not regular . □ yx1z ∈ L2 yx2z ∉ L2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
