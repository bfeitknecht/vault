A soft Neural Processing Unit (NPU), based on a high-performance field-programmable gate array (FPGA), accelerates deep neural network (DNN) inferencing, with applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Project Brainwave is transforming computing by augmenting CPUs with an interconnected and configurable compute layer composed of programmable silicon.” 13 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-brainwave/ https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-unveils-project-brainwave/ FPGAs in Today’s Systems: Amazon EC2 F1 n “Amazon EC2 F1 instances use FPGAs to enable delivery of custom hardware accelerations. F1 instances are easy to program and come with everything you need to develop, simulate, debug, and compile your hardware acceleration code, including an FPGA Developer AMI and supporting hardware level development on the cloud. Using F1 instances to deploy hardware accelerations can be useful in many applications to solve complex science, engineering, and business problems that require high bandwidth, enhanced networking, and very high compute capabilities.” 14 https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/ https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/courses/EENG428/19-20a/slides/eeng428_lecture_001_intro.pdf FPGAs in Today’s Systems: DNA Sequencing n DRAGEN’s suite of analysis pipelines are engineered to run on FPGAs, offering hardware-accelerated implementations of genomic analysis algorithms, including BCL conversion, mapping and alignment, sorting, duplicate marking and haplotype variant calling. 15 https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/dragen-bio-it-platform.html Illumina NextSeq 2000 Illumina DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics) Bio-IT Platform FPGAs in Today’s Systems: More Bioinformatics 16 Alser+, \"GateKeeper: A New Hardware Architecture for Accelerating Pre-Alignment in DNA Short Read Mapping”, Bioinformatics, 2017.
