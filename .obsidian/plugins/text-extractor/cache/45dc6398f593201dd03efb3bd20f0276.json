By the deﬁnition of gcd, we have d | a and d | b. That is, there exist k, l ∈ Z such that a = kd and b = ld. Hence, 1 = ua + vb = ukd + vld = (uk + vl)d. Thus, d | 1. Since 1 is the only positive divisor of 1, it follows that d = 1. 7.2 Geometric Interpretation of the Greatest Common Divisor Remark: a proof that assumes the steps in the footnotes without proof would still be con- sidered valid in an exam situation. Consider the line in the Cartesian plane through (0, 0) and (a, b) which has equation y = b a x. Let d = gcd(a, b). By deﬁnition, gcd(a, b) | a and gcd(a, b) | b, so that we can write a = d · k1 and b = d · k2 for some k1, k2 ∈ Z. Since a, b are positive and d is positive, then k1 and k2 must be positive. Therefore. we get y = b a x ⇐⇒ y = k2 k1 x. Observe that gcd(k1, k2) = 1.1 Assume that (x, y) is an integer solution to the equation. This means that k1 · y = k2 · x, or that in other words k1 | x · k2. Since gcd(k1, k2) = 1, this implies k1 | x.2 We are only interested in points lying in the segment with endpoints (0, 0) and (a, b), so that necessarily 0 ≤ x ≤ a = k1 · d. There are exactly d + 1 multiples of k1 between 0 and k1 · d, namely {0, k1, 2 · k1, . . . , d · k1}. This shows that there are at most gcd(a, b)+1 integer solutions to the equation above. How- ever, clearly we can plug each of these values for x in the equation to ﬁnd a corresponding point on the segment with integer coordinates. This proves the claim. 1Indeed, assume that this is not true, and let 1 < e = gcd(k1, k2). By deﬁnition, gcd(k1, k2) | k2 and gcd(k1, k2) | k2, so that we can write k1 = e · k3 and k2 = e · k4 for some k3, k3 ∈ Z. We have a = k1 · d = (k3 · e) · d = k3 · d2 and a = k1 · d = (k4 · e) · d = k4 · d2. Therefore, e · d | a and e · d | b, which means that e · d | d by deﬁnition of gcd. However, since e > 1 we have e · d > d, a contradiction. This proves gcd(k1, k2) = 1. 2This is easily seen by considering the prime factorizations of k1, k2, x, and k2 ·x. Indeed, by the uniqueness of the factorization each prime factor of k1 must be a factor of either k2 or x. It cannot be a factor of k2 because this would contradict gcd(k1, k2) = 1, and therefore it must be a factor of x. 7.3 Properties of Greatest Common Divisor Consider the unique prime factorizations a = ∏i pei i , b = ∏i p fi i , and c = ∏i pgi i (notice that only ﬁnitely many exponents are non-zero). We have gcd (a, lcm(b, c)) = gcd ( a, ∏ i p max(fi,gi) i ) (Section 4.3.3 ) = ∏ i p min (ei,max(fi,gi) ) i (Section 4.3.3) = ∏ i p max ( min(ei,fi),min(ei,gi) ) i (∗) = lcm ( ∏ i pmin(ei,fi) i , ∏ i pmin(ei,gi) i ) (Section 4.3.3) = lcm ( gcd(a, b), gcd(a, c) ). (Section 4.3.3) Proof of (∗): we show that for all x, y, z ∈ N min (x, max(y, z)) = max ( min(x, y), min(x, z) ). (1) Suppose, without loss of generality that y ≤ z (else, replace y by z). We distinguish a few cases: – (x ≤ y) Since y ≤ x in this case the left hand side of equation (1) is min(x, z) = x. On the right hand side we get max(x, x) = x. – (y ≤ x ≤ z). In this case, since max(y, z) = z, on the left hand side of equation 1 we get min(x, z) = x. On the right hand side we get max(y, x) which is again x. – (y ≤ z ≤ x). In this case, on the left hand side of the equation we get min(x, z) = z. On the right hand side we get max(y, z) which is again z. This concludes the proof of (∗). 7.4 Congruences a) Take arbitrary m, n ∈ N. By Lemma 4.14 we have 123m − 33 n ≡10 3m − 3 n. Assume without loss of generality that m ≤ n. If m ≡4 n, then there exists a k ∈ N, such that n − m = 4k and by Lemma 4.14, we have: 3 m − 3n ≡10 3 m(1 − 3n−m) ≡10 3m(1 − 3 4k) ≡10 3 m(1 − 92k) ≡10 3 m(1 − (−1) 2k) ≡10 3 m(1 − 1k) ≡10 3 m · 0 ≡10 0. b) Take any a, b, c, d, m ∈ Z, such that m > 0. Assume that a ≡m b and c ≡m d. Then, there exist s, t ∈ Z such that a − b = ms and c − d = mt. It follows that ac = (ms + b)(mt + d) = m 2st + msd + mtb + bd = m(mst + sd + tb) + bd. Therefore, m | ac − bd, so ac ≡m bd. c) Consider all possible remainders R11(n5 + 7) and R11(m2) when m, n ∈ Z. By Corol- lary 4.17, we have R11(n5 + 7) = R11((R11(n))5 + 7) and R11(m2) = R11((R11(m))2). By trying all ten possibilities for R11(n) and, respectively, for R11(m), we get that R11(n5 + 7) ∈ {6, 7, 8} and R11(m2) ∈ {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}. Since these sets are disjoint, n5 + 7 cannot be equal to m2. 7.5 Modular Arithmetic a) Take any even n ≥ 0 and let k ∈ N be such that n = 2k. By Corollary 4.17, we have R7(13n+6) = R7(R7(13)n+6) = R7(R7(−1)n+6) = R7((−1)n+6) = R7((−1)2k+6) = R7(7) = 0. Hence, 7 | 13n + 6. b) Let a, e, m, n ∈ N \\ {0} and assume that Rm(ae) = 1. By Theorem 4.1, there exists a q ∈ N, such that n = qe + Re(n). Therefore, Rm(an) = Rm (aqe+Re(n)) = Rm ((a e) q · a Re(n)) = Rm ((Rm (a e)) q · Rm (a Re(n))) (Corollary 4.17) = Rm (1q · Rm (aRe(n))) (Rm(a e) = 1) = Rm (Rm(1) q · Rm (aRe(n))) = Rm (aRe(n)) . (Corollary 4.17) c) We ﬁrst compute 2023 ≡12 2023 − 1800 ≡12 223 ≡12 223 − 180 ≡12 43 ≡12 7. By Subtask b), R13(22023) = R13(2R12(2023)) = R13(27). Now we have 27 ≡13 128 ≡13 11. 7.6 Multiplicative Inverses a) The inverse of a is Rm(u), because a · Rm(u) ≡m au ≡m 1 − vm ≡m 1. b) We ﬁrst compute gcd(142, 553), using Lemma 4.2. Notice that dividing 553 by 142, we get 553 = 3 · 142 + 127. (2) Hence, by Lemma 4.2 (setting m = 142 and n = 553), we have gcd(142, 553) = gcd(142, 127). We then repeat this trick: 142 = 127 + 15 (3) 127 = 8 · 15 + 7 (4) 15 = 2 · 7 + 1 (5) Therefore, gcd(142, 553) = gcd(142, 127) = gcd(127, 15) = gcd(15, 7) = gcd(7, 1) = 1. We now notice that rearranging Equations (1) to (4) allows us to ﬁnd u and v such that 1 = 142u + 553v as follows: 1 (4) = 15 − 2 · 7 (3) = 15 − 2 · (127 − 8 · 15) = (−2) · 127 + 17 · 15 (2) = (−2) · 127 + 17 · (142 − 127) = 17 · 142 − 19 · 127 (1) = 17 · 142 − 19 · (553 − 3 · 142) = 74 · 142 − 19 · 553 Therefore, the multiplicative inverse of 142 modulo 553 is R553(74) = 74. Note: The above method can be generalized to efﬁciently compute, for any given a and b, values u and v, such that gcd(a, b) = ua + vb. The resulting algorithm is called the extended Euclid’s gcd-algorithm. Moreover, since an integer a has the multiplicative inverse modulo m if and only if gcd(a, m) = 1, this algorithm allows to efﬁciently compute the multiplicative inverse of any number (or conclude that the inverse does not exist). 7.7 Solution of a Congruence Equation Take any a, b, m ∈ Z, such that m > 0. ax ≡m b for some x ∈ Z · ⇐⇒ ax − b = km for some x, k ∈ Z (def. ≡m) · ⇐⇒ ax + (−k)m = b for some x, k ∈ Z · ⇐⇒ b ∈ (a, m) (def. of the ideal) · ⇐⇒ b ∈ (d), where d = gcd(a, m) (Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4) · ⇐⇒ b = u · gcd(a, m) for some u ∈ Z (def. of the ideal) · ⇐⇒ gcd(a, m) | b 7.8 The Chinese Remainder Theorem a) =⇒: Assume that a ≡nm b. This means that there exists a k ∈ Z such that a − b = k(nm). Therefore, a − b = (km)n and, thus, a ≡n b. Analogously, we get a ≡m b. ⇐=: Assume that a ≡n b ∧ a ≡m b. Now consider the system of congruence equations x ≡n Rn(b) ∧ x ≡m Rm(b). By Lemma 4.16, we have a ≡n b ∧ a ≡m b ⇐⇒ a ≡n Rn(b) ∧ a ≡m Rm(b). Hence, by the assumption, x = a is a solution to the system of congruence equations. Analogously, x = b is also a valid solution. Since gcd(n, m) = 1, it follows from the Chinese Remainder Theorem that all solu- tions for x are congruent modulo nm. Therefore, we must have a ≡nm b. b) Since m and n are not relatively prime, we cannot apply directly the Chinese Remain- der Theorem. Therefore, we will transform the system of congruence equations. By subtask a), the following system of congruence equations is equivalent: x ≡a y1 (1) x ≡b y1 (2) x ≡a y2 (3) x ≡c y2 (4) If y1 ̸≡a y2, there are clearly no solutions. Otherwise, the equations (1) and (3) are equivalent and we can remove (3). By Lemma 4.16, we get the following equivalent system of congruence equations: x ≡a Ra(y1) x ≡b Rb(y1) x ≡c Rc(y2) Since a, b, c are pairwise relatively prime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guaran- tees that there exists a unique solution x0 such that 0 ≤ x0 < abc. All remaining solutions must be of the form x0 + k(abc) for k ∈ N. Since nm = a2bc, there exist exactly a solutions x such that 0 ≤ x < nm.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
