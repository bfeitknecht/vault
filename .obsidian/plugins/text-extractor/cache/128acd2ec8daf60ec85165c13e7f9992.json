Furthermore, per lemma 5.35 for m(x) = x3 − x2 + 1, the structure Z3[x]m(x) is a ring. To prove that F is a ﬁeld, per theorem 5.37 it remains to show that m(x) is irreducible. From the fact that the degree of m(x) is three it follows by theorem 5.31 that it has at most three roots. Since it trivially isn't the zero polynomial, corollary 5.30 states that it's irreducible if and only if it has no roots in Z3. The evaluation below demonstrates that this holds true. Thus, m(x) is an irreducible polynomial in Z3 and hence F is a ﬁeld. □ m(0) = 03 − 02 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0 m(1) = 13 − 12 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0 m(2) = 23 − 22 + 1 = 2 ≠ 0 b) Recall that F ∗ is the (cyclic) group of units in the ﬁnite ﬁeld F . Its order is given by the following. The elements of F ∗ are polynomials of the form a(x) = α2x2 + α1x + α0, where αi ∈ Z3, not all equal zero. Since all constant polynomials only generate constant polynomials, let's consider the simplest monic polynomial with an indeterminate, g(x) = x ∈ F ∗. The computations of the powers of g(x) are given below. It can be observed, that after the ﬁrst thirteen iterations, continued exponentiation repeats the additive inverses of the previous thirteen elements. Thus, since it holds that ⟨x⟩ = F ∗, the polynomial g(x) = x is a generator ofF ∗. An alternative approach is given as follows. By lagrange's theorem (T. 5.8.), for a ﬁnite group G and subgroup H it holds that the order of H divides the order of G. Let H = ⟨x⟩ ⊆ F ∗ be the subgroup generated by the postulated generator x. Thus it must be true that |H| ∈ {1, 2, 13, 26}, since those are the possible orders that divide the order of |F ∗| = 26. Then per corollary 5.10, we know that x|H| = 1, since trivially x ∈ H. Then, for n ∈ {1, 2, 13} we have xn ≠ 1 as shown below. However, we have x26 = 22 ≡ m(x) 1. Thus, since the order of the subgroup generated by x is equal to that of the multiplicative group of the underlying ﬁeld, |H| = 26 = |F ∗| and the subgroup is a subset of the multiplicative group of units H ⊆ F ∗, it must be that H = F ∗. Hence x is a generator of F ∗. □ |F ∗| = |F − {0}| (D. 5.26.) = |F | − 1 (L. 5.34.) = |Z3|deg(m(x)) − 1 = 33 − 1 = 26 g(x) 0 = x0 ≡ m(x) 1 g(x) 1 = x1 ≡ m(x) x g(x) 2 = x2 ≡ m(x) x2 g(x) 3 = x3 ≡ m(x) x2 − 1 g(x) 4 = x4 ≡ m(x) x2 − x − 1 g(x) 5 = x5 ≡ m(x) −x − 1 g(x) 6 = x6 ≡ m(x) −x2 − x g(x) 7 = x7 ≡ m(x) x2 + 1 g(x) 8 = x8 ≡ m(x) x2 + x − 1 g(x) 9 = x9 ≡ m(x) −x2 − x − 1 g(x) 10 = x10 ≡ m(x) x2 − x + 1 g(x) 11 = x11 ≡ m(x) x − 1 g(x) 12 = x12 ≡ m(x) x2 − x = −g(x) −1 g(x) 13 = x13 ≡ m(x) −1 = −g(x) 0   g(x) 14 = x14 ≡ m(x) −x = −g(x) 1   g(x) 15 = x15 ≡ m(x) −x2 = −g(x) 2   ⋮ ⋮ g(x) 25 = x25 ≡ m(x) −x2 + x = g(x) −1    g(x) 26 = x26 ≡ m(x) 1 x1 ≡ m(x) x x2 ≡ m(x) x2 x13 ≡ m(x) 2 c) Recall that F is the ﬁeld of polynomials in x with coeﬃcients in Z3 and degree less than three. Then F [y] is the ring of polynomials in y with coeﬃcients in F . Per theorem 5.31, since F is a ﬁeld, the non-zero polynomial a(y) ∈ F [y] of degree d = 2 has at most two roots, i.e. an element α ∈ F such that a(α) = 0. First, let's consider the element α1 = x ∈ F . Evaluation conﬁrms that this is a root, as shown below. Second, observe α2 = x2 ∈ F . Computation of the polynomial yields the following. Thus we have found the two roots, α1, α2 ∈ F of a(y). □ a(x) = x2 − x(x2 + x) + (x2 + 2) (distributivity) = x2 − x3 + 2 (additive inverse) = −x3 + x2 − 1 (constant multiple) = −1(x3 − x2 + 1) ≡ m(x) 0 − x2 + x2 a(x2) = (x2) 2 − x2(x2 + x) + (x2 + 2) (distributivity) = − x3 + x2 + 2 (additive inverse) = −x3 + x2 − 1 (constant multiple) = −1(x3 − x2 + 1) ≡ m(x) 0 x4 − x4","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
