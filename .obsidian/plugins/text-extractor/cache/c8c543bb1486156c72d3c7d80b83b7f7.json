Question 1.1 Anycast-based CDNs have greater flexibility in load management than DNS-based ones. Question 1.2 Exclusively-anycast-based services may resolve the same domain name to different IP addresses for different clients. Question 1.3 For DNS-based CDNs, the content provider must dynamically rewrite URLs for each client request. Question 2: Video Streaming Question 2.1 Assume you are watching a video on Netflix, and your buffer contains 30s of unplayed video when the player starts to download chunk X. Assume chunk X to be 1.4MB and 4s long, your link bandwidth to be 1Mbps and the RTT between you and Netflix CDN to be of 50ms. Assume that downloading chunk X contains sending a request (with tiny size) and receiving the data. All other delays are negligible. Assume that the player is using a single persistent TCP connection to download the segments. • Do you experience rebuffering? • If not, how many seconds of unplayed video will your buffer contain after the download of chunk X? Question 2.2 Assume now that the chunk size of segment X in KB is ∼ P oisson(3700KB), meaning that the chunk size follows a discrete distribution with granularity of 1KB. What is the probability of rebuffering? Question 3: Video Streaming True or false? 1 Question 3.1 Video resolution is a synonym of video bitrate. Question 3.2 In video streaming, the entire content is usually provided as a single continuous flow of bytes at once. Question 3.3 Adaptation algorithms may vary depending on users’ devices. Question 3.4 Usually, all chunks of a particular video content are stored exclusively on a single server. Question 3.5 Video chunks duration is typically in the order of seconds. Question 3.6 Video providers usually geographically replicate their video content. Question 4: Video Chunk Size In VOD (Video-On-Demand) video streaming, video is divided into chunks of equal length. Discuss briefly what is the tradeoff between short and long video chunks. Question 5: Adapting Video Quality You are starting your brand new video streaming service. Should you deploy the logic for adapting video quality over time on the client or on the server? Discuss pros and cons. 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
