Then we ﬁnd a topological sorting. Contradiction. This topological sorting has to start from a source but by assumption there are none. Furthermore, a topological sorting is possible if and only if the graph is a directed acyclic cycle. Contraposition of the fact that it doesn't implies that G contains a cycle. □ (b) False. Consider the following counter example. Observe that every vertex has even in-degree and out-degree, ∀v ∈ V : degin(v) ≡ 2 degout(v) ≡ 2 0. However, G does not contain a directed eulerian walk. 1 2 3 4 5 6 □ (c) True.
