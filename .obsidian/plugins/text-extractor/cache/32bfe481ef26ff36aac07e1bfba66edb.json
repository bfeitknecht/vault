Gürkaynak Seyyedmohammad Sadrosadati ETH Zurich Spring 2024 [19. March 2024] What Will We Learn? n In Lab 3, you will design more combinatorial circuits. n Convert a binary number to 7-Segment display encoding. n Implement a circuit to drive the 7-Segment display. n Show the addition result on the 7-Segment display. 2 7-Segment Display n A 7-segment display consists of seven separate LEDs in a single package. n Each of the seven segments is labeled using the letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g. 3 Representing Different Numbers n We can represent different characters or digits by making particular segments glow at the same time. 4 Binary Number to 7-Segment Encoding n As a first step, you will complete the truth table for converting a 4-bit number to a 7-segment encoding. n Note: A segment glows when the corresponding output is set to logic-0. 5 Drive the 7-Segment Display n Design a “decoder” that receives a 4-bit input and returns a 7-bit output signal, and converts a binary number to a 7-segment display encoding. n Make sure to use behavioural modelling instead of explicit gate- level modelling. 6 Show the Results of the Addition n Show the result of our adder circuit from Lab 2 using the 7- segment display. You need one overflow bit to be displayed on an LED. n Attach an instance of the decoder to the output of the adder. n Hint: Create a new “top” module that will create an instance of each module and make appropriate connections between them. 7 Decoder n You do not use gate-level implementation. n Instead of gates use behavioural modeling. 8 Gate-level implementation Behavioural implementation Last Words n In Lab 3, you will design more combinatorial circuits. n Convert a binary number to 7-Segment display encoding. n Implement a circuit to drive the 7-Segment display. n Show the addition result on the 7-Segment display. n In the report, you will learn how to display the addition result using only a single 7-segment display. 9 Report Deadline 10 [19.
