Simply run dijkstra's algorithm with the modiﬁcation of updating the associated weights to reach vertices with their logarithm. Additional edges sum up the logarithm, since log(a ⋅ b) = log(a) + log(b) and edge weights are strictly greater than zero by deﬁnition. 11.2 Rotating Weights no idea 11.4 Rail Racer (b) 1. undirected weighted graph, every checkpoint is another vertex and the edge weight is speed limit on that stretch. 2. shortest path without negative cycles 3. probably dijkstra or some other shortest path ﬁnding algorithm","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
