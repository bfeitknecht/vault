UDP does not use ports E. The slow-start phase increases the congestion window more aggressively than the congestion avoidance phase F. TCP is a stop-and-wait protocol G. UDP establishes the connection using a three-way handshake H. If there is a TCP connection from a client to a server, and the client changes IP address, a new TCP connection must be established.

Assume both inﬁnite bandwidth and inﬁnite initial TCP window. Originally, HTTP/1.0 only sent a new request once the response for the previous request was received. It opened a new TCP connection for the retrieval of each object. i. (1 point) How many RTTs would it take to retrieve all n objects using HTTP/1.0? A. 2n B. n C. 1 + n D. n2 ii.

(1 point) At a later stage, ”Connection: Keep-Alive” was added to HTTP/1.0, let’s call it HTTP/1.0+KA. In this version of HTTP, a TCP connection is kept alive, and as such is persistent meaning it does not have to be re-opened for each subsequent request.

How many RTTs would it take to retrieve all n objects over a single persistent TCP con- nection using HTTP/1.1? A. 1 B. 2 C. n D. 1 + n Page 6 vi. (2 points) Assume bandwidth (and initial congestion window) is limited again. HTTP/1.1 with pipelining has a disadvantage due to its sequential nature in receiving responses.

Opening multiple TCP connections can help reduce head-of-line blocking C. It is possible in the general case to mitigate all head-of-line blocking when using TCP as transport layer protocol D. Head-of-line blocking increases the whole completion time (meaning the time until the last object is fetched) (d) (4 points) Video streaming i. (2 points) Which of the following statements is/are true? A. For any two videos, a certain bitrate will always result in the same resolution B. For a buﬀer-based adaptation algorithm in general, the emptier the buﬀer, the lower resolution chunks are requested C. For a rate-based adaptation algorithm in general, the higher the estimated rate, the higher resolution chunks are requested D. For any two client devices, the same video resolution results in the same user quality of experience ii. (2 points) List and shortly motivate, in one sentence each, two types of information that can be contained in the chunk manifest for each chunk which could be relevant to the decision process of an adaptation algorithm. There exist more than 2, but you must only state 2. Page 7 3. The Transport Layer (29 points) (a) (4 points) Transport principles i. (2 points) Which of the following statements is/are true? A. TCP headers are not visible to all network devices between two communicating hosts B. The end-to-end check of a ﬁle transfer must still be implemented no matter how reliable the communication system becomes C. The primary goal of congestion control is to not overwhelm the receiver D. Timeliness is maximized with a window size equal to the bandwidth-RTT product ii. (2 points) Name 4 negative eﬀects that can happen to individual packets or a stream of packets due to varying network conditions. In the best case, it is correctly delivered to the receiver. Page 8 (b) (17 points) Transport protocols i. (5 points) TCP phase switches. A TCP connection uses fast-retransmit/recovery, time- outs, congestion avoidance and slow start. Figure 3 shows an example of the change in the size of the congestion window of such a TCP connection over time (in RTTs). (The initial ssthresh is set to 8 packets). (The duration of the timeout is 4 RTTs.) At the time points in the table, a certain event happened, which caused TCP to switch from congestion avoidance to slow start or from slow start to congestion avoidance. Derive from the ﬁgure, which events happened when, and ﬁll them into the table: the possible events are (a) ssthresh reached (SSR), (b) timeout occurred (TIMEOUT), or (c) a fast-retransmit/recovery (FAST). Ex- actly one event type occurred at each time point. Each event type can have occurred zero or more times overall. The grading of this question is based only on the table (no explanation is required). Time point in RTTs Event 3 5 12 15 21 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 0 5 10 15 20 Figure 3: Congestion window size in packets (y-axis) against time in number of RTTs (x-axis) Page 9 ii. (3 points) Go-Back-N. Consider a Go-Back-N sender and receiver directly connected by a 15 Mbps link with a one-way propagation delay of 150 milliseconds. (There is no out-of- order buﬀering because it is Go-Back-N.) The retransmission timer is set to 3 seconds and the window has a length of 2 segments. The sender’s timeout timer is reset each time an ACK is received, even if it is a duplicate. An ACK is transmitted as soon as the last bit of the corresponding data segment is re- ceived and the size of the ACK is negligibly small. 4 segments are to be sent, and each segment contains 15000 bits. The ﬁrst transmission of the 3rd segment is dropped. All other transmissions of segments and acknowledgments are successful. Fill in the table below with the acknowledgement times of the segments. The acknowledgement time is the moment at which the sender has a segment cumulatively acknowledged and as such can move the window. Hint: We suggest drawing a time sequence diagram (e.g., Figure 4) before ﬁlling in the table. The grading of this question is based only on the table (no explanation is required). Segment Acknowledgement time (ms) 1 2 3 4 3905ms 21 A1 A2 0ms Figure 4: Time sequence diagram template. Page 10 iii. (2 points) Timeout events. TCP doubles its timeout interval after a timeout event. This mechanism is a form of congestion control. Does TCP need a window-based congestion- control mechanism in addition to this doubling-timeout-interval mechanism? (pick a single answer) A. No, as TCP only sends one segment at a time a timeout interval would suﬃce as the congestion control mechanism. B. No, as TCP senders will synchronise their rate quickly via the timeout interval. C. Yes, in order to prevent a TCP sender from re-sending a large number of ﬁrst- time-transmitted packets into the network. D. Yes, as the timeout interval frequently lowers the sending rate when reordering happens. iv. (2 points) Maximum window size. Consider that only a single TCP (Reno) connection uses one 80Mbps (8 ∗ 107 bits per second) link which does not buﬀer any data. Suppose that this link is the only congested link between the sending and receiving hosts. Assume that the TCP sender has a huge ﬁle to send to the receiver, and the receiver’s receive buﬀer is much larger than the congestion window. We also make the following assumptions: each TCP segment size is 1500 bytes; the two-way propagation delay of this connection is 0.15 seconds; and this TCP connection is always in congestion avoidance phase, that is, ignore slow start. What is the maximum window size (in segments) that this TCP connection can achieve? A. 50 B. 400 C. 1000 D. 1200 E. 2000 F. 3000 v. (2 points) Acknowledgements and timeouts. Which statement(s) is/are true? A. If the last data packet of a ﬁle transfer over TCP is lost, a fast retransmit won’t be triggered B. By decreasing the amount of DupACKs required to trigger fast retransmit/recov- ery, it will take longer before a single lost data packet is retransmitted C. When a TCP retransmission timeout occurs, the retransmission timer is reset and the retransmission timeout is doubled D. The higher the TCP retransmission timeout is set, the longer it takes to retransmit a lost data packet if fast retransmit did not get triggered Page 11 vi. (3 points) Sharing of a bottleneck link Consider the topology shown in Figure 5. Links A-R, B-R and C-R have identical delay and bandwidth , the hosts all use the same AIMD congestion control, with a higher transmission rate than link R-D. Transmitting hosts A, B and C all have to share the same link to send data to host D. Figure 5: Link sharing over multiple users Calculate the share in percentage of the link capacity of R-D that each host gets (considering a long time after the connections have been established) in each of the following cases. 1. A, B and C are transmitting data. Each host uses a single TCP ﬂow. A : ........% B : ........% C : ........% 2. A, B and C are transmitting data. A and B use only one TCP ﬂow, and C uses three parallel TCP ﬂows. A : ........% B : ........% C : ........% 3. A, B and C are transmitting data. A and B each use one TCP ﬂow. C uses a UDP- based application which transmits data at a constant rate of 30% of the capacity of link R-D. A : ........% B : ........% C : ........% (c) (2 points) Linear Programming Which of the following statements is/are true? A. The absolute value constraint |X| < 5, where X is a continuous variable, can be expressed as a ﬁnite set of linear constraints. B. The modulo constraint A = B mod 5, where A and B are integer variables, can be expressed as a ﬁnite set of integer linear constraints. C. Any non-linear constraint can be expressed as a ﬁnite set of linear constraints D. If a linear program that describes a graph problem cannot be solved in O(n2), where n is a number of nodes, there is no algorithm that can solve the same problem in O(n2). Page 12 (d) (4 points) Design a failure-resilient network If a network can sustain a failure of any link in the network and still keep connectivity between each pair of nodes (no nodes or group of nodes are disconnected), we call such a network 1-failure-resilient. i. (2 points) Describe, using only the algorithms discussed in class as building blocks, an algorithm that checks if a given directed multigraph (a graph in which there can be multiple parallel links between a pair of nodes) is 1-failure-resilient. ii. (2 points) Consider a connected directed multigraph as input. Design an algorithm that modiﬁes this multigraph by adding edges, such that the resulting multigraph is 1-failure- resilient. (e) (2 points) Bloom ﬁlters You design a cache based on a Bloom ﬁlter, for which the total number of diﬀerent elements that could be stored is n. Which of the following statements is/are true? A. For a given memory size m, there is an optimal number, k, of hash functions that minimizes the false positive rate. B. Deletion of an element by simply setting all of its k bits to 0 in the Bloom ﬁlter can result in false-negative look-ups of other elements. C. There are two elements a1 and a2 that have exactly the same hash value for all k hash functions. By ﬁrst adding a1 and then a2, a2 will override the existence of a1. If we next query the ﬁlter for a1, the reply will be negative – a1 is removed from the ﬁlter. D. If we ﬂip all the ones and zeros in a populated Bloom ﬁlter, and then query it for an element a, the query results in a miss only if a was in the original ﬁlter (before we ﬂipped its bits). Page 13 4. Network Layer (35 points) (a) (8 points) Network Address Translation (NAT) i. (6 points) Consider the network topology as depicted in Fig. 6. Imagine you can observe two UDP packets sent between clients C1, C2, and C3, and server S1 at diﬀerent machines as shown in the following table. Fill in the missing IP addresses of clients, NAT devices, and server and the smallest possible subnets (i.e., containing the smallest possible number of addresses) in Fig. 6. S1 and NAT1 are not behind a NAT, i.e., are directly connected to the Internet, and have a public IP address.

Page 14 (b) (12 points) IP Preﬁxes i. (6 points) Longest-Preﬁx Matching: Consider a router with the following IPv4 forwarding table.

(6 points) For the IP preﬁxes in the following table, ﬁll in (1) the subnet mask, (2) how many hosts it can contain (remember that the ﬁrst and last address is reserved), and (3) how many preﬁxes with the same length exist in the whole IPv4 address space.

(3 points) Remember that IP uses packet switching while MPLS uses virtual circuits. Name two advantages each of the two diﬀerent forwarding systems. 1. Advantages of packet switching: 2. Advantages of virtual circuits: ii. (4 points) Consider the following intradomain network consisting of 4 label-switched (MPLS) routers R1–R4 with their interfaces and respective (partial) forwarding tables as well as ex- ternal addresses A–C. R1 R2 R3 R4 2 1 3 1 4 2 4 3 1 A 2 B 1 C in label out label dest out IF 13 - A 1 - 42 B 2 - 314 C 3 in label out label dest out IF 2 13 A 1 42 - B 2 314 16 C 4 in label out label dest out IF 314 27 C 4 in label out label dest out IF - 2 A 2 - 42 B 2 16 - C 1 27 - C 1 For the following two packets, which arrive without MPLS labels, specify by which routers they are processed (in order) and the MPLS label they carry after each hop (you may not need all lines): 1. Packet with destination C arriving at R1: processed by label after processing R1 2. Packet with destination B arriving at R4: processed by label after processing R4 Page 16 (d) (8 points) Inferring AS Relationships from BGP Updates Interconnection agreements between ASes are usually conﬁdential, because AS operators fear that revealing their providers, customers and peers weakens their bargaining position in future negotiations. However, for many purposes in business and research, it is still useful to have information about AS relationships. Fortunately, AS relationships can be (at least partially) inferred based on two key insights: • BGP update messages, containing announced paths, can be publicly observed in the net- work. • In general, ASes are economically rational entities, i.e., they aim to minimize their cost by applying the BGP policies presented in the course. Hence, by observing BGP update messages, some possible AS relationships can be ruled out, as rational ASes would not send the observed BGP messages given those relationships. In this task, we apply such reasoning to elicit possible AS relationships for the AS topology in Figure 7, where the AS relationships are unknown. Furthermore, the ﬁgure also contains the BGP update messages that are observed in the topology. A B C ID Sender Receiver Route 1 A B (A,C) 2 A C (A,B) 3 C A (C,B) 4 C B (C,A) Figure 7: AS topology with unknown relationships and observed BGP update messages (Stub routes with single AS hop are not shown). With these BGP updates in mind, consider the following relationship assignments and answer the corresponding questions. Note that in all the topologies with assigned relationships, a provider-customer relationship is indicated by an arrow X → Y , where X is the provider and Y is the customer, and a peering relationship between two ASes X and Y is indicated by a dashed line X Y . i. (4 points) Relationship Assignment 1 A B C Are these AS relationships plausible given the observed BGP update messages? If not, name the updates (IDs) that are implausible if the shown relationship were the actual relationships, and explain why. Assume that the shown relationships are the actual relationships. Furthermore, assume that the BGP announcements are performed by rational ASes, so not necessarily as in Figure 7. Which route would AS B select to reach AS A, and why? Page 17 ii. (4 points) Relationship Assignment 2 A B C Are these AS relationships plausible given the observed BGP update messages? If not, name the updates (IDs) that are implausible if the shown relationship were the actual relationships, and explain why. Assume that the shown relationships are the actual relationships. Furthermore, assume that the BGP announcements are performed by rational ASes, so not necessarily as in Figure 7. Which route would AS B select to reach AS A, and why? Page 18 5. The Link Layer (20 points) (a) (5 points) Hamming Code In this task, we are concerned with the following Hamming code, where the bit positions are indicated in gray below the code: 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 5 4 3 2 1 i. (1 point) In the code above, underline the check bits of the code. ii. (2 points) Calculate the syndrome of the code. iii. (2 points) Based on the syndrome, determine if a bit ﬂipped in the code during transmission and explain your reasoning. If a bit ﬂipped, correct the code appropriately. (b) (4 points) Error Detection and Error Correction Consider a network where messages of length 1500 bytes are exchanged repeatedly. The bit- error rate of the network is such that the following probabilities hold on the number f of bit ﬂips in a message: P (f = 1) = 0.2 P (f ≥ 2) ≈ 0 Following the sub-tasks below, investigate whether error detection or error correction is more appropriate for this network. i. (1 point) How many check bits are needed in a Hamming Code that is strong enough to protect the integrity of an exchanged message against a one-bit error? ii. (1 point) Given the distribution of f , which of the error-detection schemes from the lecture is most appropriate for the network? Explain your reasoning. iii. (2 points) For a number of transmitted messages M , determine the expected number of total bits to transmit given the schemes for error correction and error detection from the previous sub-tasks, respectively. Based on this metric, argue which approach is more appropriate for the network. Hint: In error correction and error detection, the receiver’s reaction upon discovery of a bit ﬂip are diﬀerent. Page 19 (c) (7 points) Clock Recovery In this task, we explore baseband encoding of the following message: 0010 1011 1110 0101 i. (1 point) Encode the message using NRZI (where 1 maps to a signal change, and 0 is no change). We assume that the signal starts at the high voltage level. A corresponding NRZ encoding is provided as an example. NRZ NRZI ii. (1 point) To avoid errors due to clock drift, we ﬁrst encode the message using the 4B5B encoding. Provide the message (in binary) that results from this. You can use the following table as a reference: Data Code 0000 11110 0001 01001 0010 10100 0011 10101 0100 01010 0101 01011 0110 01110 0111 01111 Data Code 1000 10010 1001 10011 1010 10110 1011 10111 1100 11010 1101 11011 1110 11100 1111 11101 iii. (3 points) The data (encoded using NRZI and 4B5B) is transmitted over a wire that has capacity 1 Gb/s. What is the minimum time that the sender and receiver clocks need to constantly deviate per second such that synchronization errors (i.e., an extra zero or too few zeros) can occur? Page 20 iv. (2 points) In a scenario where the clocks are even more inaccurate than the bound computed above, 4B5B encoding is insuﬃcient to ensure correct message delivery. To ﬁx this issue, we will now design a new encoding we call 2B3B (i.e., which maps 2-bit words to 3-bit words). In the following table, provide a code that provides stronger clock recovery properties than 4B5B and state that property. Data Code 00 01 10 11 (d) (4 points) Coding Schemes Most coding schemes that we have looked at use two signal levels, distinguishing only between high and low voltage. In this task, we explore possibilities of using more such levels. i. (1 point) In return-to-zero coding, the signal drops to the zero voltage after each transmit- ted symbol. What is an advantage and a disadvantage of this scheme when compared to the more commonly used non-return-to-zero coding? RZ ii. (2 points) We now design a diﬀerent scheme that uses the three signal levels for higher- bandwidth transmissions. For this, we deﬁne a mapping f : {V0, V1, V2} → {0, 1} ∗ from the signal levels to bitstrings of variable length. Provide a mapping that allows arbitrary messages to be encoded in as few symbols as possible. iii. (1 point) What fundamental theorem limits the number of diﬀerent symbols that can be distinguished in a given setting?
