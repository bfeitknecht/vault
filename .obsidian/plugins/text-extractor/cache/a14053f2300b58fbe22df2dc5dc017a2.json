Properties of media • Wires, fiber optics, wireless 2. Simple signal propagation • Bandwidth, attenuation, noise 3. Modulation schemes • Representing bits, noise 4. Fundamental limits • Nyquist, Shannon 4 Simple Link Model We will end with an abstraction of a physical channel • Rate (or bandwidth, capacity, speed) in bits/second • Delay or Latency in seconds, related to message length and distance Other important properties: • Whether the channel is broadcast, and its error rate 5 Delay D, Rate R Message Message Latency Latency L: delay to send a message over a link • Transmission delay: time to put M-bit message “on the wire” T-delay = M (bits) / Rate (bits/sec) = M/R seconds • Propagation delay: time for bits to propagate across the wire P-delay = Length / speed of signals = Length / ⅔c = D seconds • Combining the two terms we have: L = M/R + D 6 Metric Units The main prefixes we use: Use powers of 10 for rates, 2 for storage or data size • 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps, 1 KB = 2 10 bytes “B” is for bytes, “b” is for bits 7 Prefix Exp. prefix exp. K(ilo) 10 3 m(illi) 10 -3 M(ega) 106 μ(micro) 10-6 G(iga) 10 9 n(ano) 10 -9 Latency Examples “Dialup” with a telephone modem: • D = 5 ms, R = 56 kbps, M = 1250 bytes Broadband cross-country link: • D = 50 ms, R = 10 Mbps, M = 1250 bytes 8 Latency Examples (2) “Dialup” with a telephone modem: • D = 5 ms, R = 56 kbps, M = 1250 bytes • L = 5 ms + (1250 * 8)/(56 * 10 3) sec = 184 ms! Broadband cross-country link: • D = 50 ms, R = 10 Mbps, M = 1250 bytes • L = 50 ms + (1250 * 8) / (10 * 10 6) sec = 51 ms A long link or a slow rate means high latency • Often, one delay component dominates 9 Bandwidth-Delay Product Messages take space on the wire! The amount of data in flight is the bandwidth-delay (BD) product BD = R x D • Measure in bits, or in messages • Small for LANs, big for “long fat” pipes 10 Bandwidth-Delay Example • Fiber at home, cross-country R = 40 Mbps, D = 50 ms BD = 40 x 10 6 x 50 x 10 -3 bits = 2000 Kbit = 250 KB • That’s quite a lot of data “in the network”! 11 110101000010111010101001011 How “Long” is a Bit? • Interesting trivia: how “long” is the representation of a bit on a wire? • Considering a fiber optic cable • Signal propagation speed: 200’000’000 m/s • Sending rate: 1Gbps, duration of sending one bit: 1ns • Bit “length”: 1ns * 200’000’000 m/s = 0.2 m • “Length” of a 1KB packet: 0.2m * 8 * 2 10 = 1.6km 12 Types of Media (§1.2.2) • Media propagate signals that carry bits of information • We’ll look at some common types: • Wires • Fiber (fiber optic cables) • Wireless 13 Wires – Twisted Pair Very common; used in LANs and telephone lines • Twists can reduce radiated signal or reduce effect of external interference signal 14 Category 5 UTP cable with four twisted pairs Wires – Coaxial Cable • Also common. Better shielding for better performance • Other kinds of wires too: e.g., electrical power 15 Fiber Long, thin, pure strands of glass • Enormous bandwidth (high speed) over long distances 16 Light source (LED, laser) Photo-detectorLight trapped by total internal reflection Optical fiber Fiber (2) Two varieties: multi-mode (shorter links, cheaper) and single-mode (up to ~100 km) 17 Fiber bundle in a cable One fiber Wireless Sender radiates signal over a region • In many directions, unlike a wire, to potentially many receivers • Nearby signals (same freq.) interfere at a receiver; need to coordinate use 1819 WiFi WiFi Wireless (2) Microwave, e.g., 3G, and unlicensed (ISM: Industry Science Medicine) frequencies, e.g., WiFi, are widely used for computer networking 21 802.11 b/g/n 802.11a/g/n Signals Analog signals encode digital bits. We want to know what happens as signals propagate over media 22 …1011010110… Signal weights of harmonic frequencies Signal over time = Frequency Representation A signal over time can be represented by its frequency components (called Fourier analysis) 23amplitude Lost! Effect of Less Bandwidth Fewer frequencies (=less bandwidth) degrades signal 24 Lost! Lost! Bandwidth Signals over a Wire What happens to a signal as it passes over a wire? 1. The signal is delayed (propagates at ⅔c) 2. The signal is attenuated 3. Frequencies above a cutoff are highly attenuated 4. Noise is added to the signal (causes errors) 25 EE: Bandwidth = width of frequency band, measured in Hz CS: Bandwidth = information carrying capacity, in bits/sec Signals over Fiber Light propagates with very low loss in three very wide frequency bands • Use a carrier to send information 26 Wavelength (μm) Attenuation (dB/km 1,5 um =0,2 dB/km By SVG: Sassospicco Raster: Alexwind, CC-BY-SA-3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Signals over Wireless (§7.2) Travel at speed of light, spread out and attenuate faster than 1/dist2 27 Signal strength DistanceA B Signals over Wireless (2) Multiple signals on the same frequency interfere at a receiver 28 Signal strength DistanceA BC Signals over Wireless (3) Interference leads to notion of spatial reuse (of same freq.) 29 Signal strength DistanceA BC Signals over Wireless (4) Various other effects too! • Wireless propagation is complex, depends on environment Some key effects are highly frequency dependent • E.g., multipath at microwave frequencies 30 Wireless Multipath Signals bounce off objects and take multiple paths • Some frequencies attenuated at receiver, varies with location • Messes up signal; handled with sophisticated methods 31 Modulation We’ve talked about signals representing bits. How, exactly? • This is the topic of modulation 32 …1011010110… Signal A Simple Modulation Let a high voltage (+V) represent a 1, and low voltage (-V) represent a 0 • This is called NRZ (Non-Return to Zero) 33 Bits NRZ 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 +V -V Many Other Schemes Can use more signal levels, e.g., 4 levels is 2 bits per symbol Practical schemes are driven by engineering considerations • E.g., clock recovery 34 Um, how many zeros was that? • Receiver needs frequent signal transitions to decode bits Several possible designs • E.g., Manchester coding and scrambling Clock Recovery 35 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 … 0 Clock Recovery – 4B/5B Map every 4 data bits into 5 code bits without long runs of zeros • 0000  11110, 0001  01001, 1110  11100, … 1111  11101 • Has at most 3 consecutive zeros • Also invert signal level on a 1 to break up long runs of 1s (called NRZI) 36 Clock Recovery – 4B/5B (2) 4B/5B code for reference: • 000011110, 000101001, 111011100, … 111111101 Message bits: 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 37 Coded Bits: Signal: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 Passband Modulation What we have seen so far is baseband modulation for wires • Signal is sent directly on a wire These signals do not propagate well on fiber / wireless • Need to send at higher frequencies Passband modulation carries a signal by modulating a carrier 38 Passband Modulation (2) Carrier is simply a signal oscillating at a desired frequency: We can modulate it by changing: • Amplitude, frequency, or phase 39 Passband Modulation (3) 40 NRZ signal of bits Amplitude shift keying Frequency shift keying Phase shift keying Fundamental Limits How rapidly can we send information over a link? • Nyquist limit (~1924) • Shannon capacity (1948) Practical systems are devised to approach these limits 41 Key Channel Properties The bandwidth (B), signal strength (S), and noise strength (N) • B limits the rate of transitions • S and N limit how many signal levels we can distinguish 42 Bandwidth B Signal S, Noise N Nyquist Limit The maximum symbol rate is 2B Thus if there are V signal levels, ignoring noise, the maximum bit rate is: 43 R = 2B log2V bits/sec 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 Claude Shannon (1916-2001) • Father of information theory • “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”, 1948 • Fundamental contributions to digital computers, security, and communications 44 Credit: Courtesy MIT Museum Electromechanical mouse that “solves” mazes! Shannon Capacity How many levels we can distinguish depends on S/N • Or SNR, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio • Note noise is random, hence some errors SNR given on a log-scale in deciBels (dB): • SNRdB = 10log10(S/N) 45 0 1 2 3 N S+N Shannon Capacity (2) Shannon limit is for capacity (C), the maximum information carrying rate of the channel: 46 C = B log2(1 + S/N) bits/sec Wired/Wireless Perspective Wires and Fiber • Engineer link to have requisite SNR and B →Can fix data rate Wireless • Given B, but SNR varies greatly, e.g., up to 60 dB! →Can’t design for worst case, must adapt data rate 47 Engineer SNR for data rate Adapt data rate to SNR Putting it all together – DSL DSL (Digital Subscriber Line, see §1.2.1) is widely used for broadband; many variants offer 10s of Mbps • Reuses twisted pair telephone line to the home; it has up to ~2 MHz of bandwidth but uses only the lowest ~4 kHz 48 DSL (2) DSL uses passband modulation (called OFDM §7.4.3) • Separate bands for upstream and downstream (larger) • Modulation varies both amplitude and phase (called QAM) • High SNR, up to 15 bits/symbol, low SNR only 1 bit/symbol 49 Upstream Downstream 26 – 138 kHz 0-4 kHz 143 kHz to 1.1 MHz Telephone Freq.
