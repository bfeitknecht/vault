Consider that each source What do they get with: needs 10 Mbps on average • reservation • on-demand 30 Mbps 105 Assume the following peak demand and flow duration 13 Mbps time 11 Mbps 10 Mbpssource 1 source 2 source 3 106 Assume the following peak demand and flow duration time source 1 source 2 source 3 What does each source get with reservation and on-demand? first-come first-served equal (10 Mbps) 13 Mbps 11 Mbps 10 Mbps 107 Peak vs average rates Each flow has Peak rate P Average rate A Reservation must reserve P, but level of utilization is A/P e.g., P=100 Mbps, A=10 Mbps, level of utilization=10% On-demand can usually achieve higher level of utilization depends on degree of sharing and burstiness of flows 108 Ultimately, it depends on the application Large Peak / Average → On-demand >100 for Web Small Peak / Average → Circuits with reservation ~3 for voice 109 Ultimately, it depends on the application Reservation wastes capacity when P/A is big data applications are bursty, ratios >100 are common Reservation makes sense when P/A is small voice traffic has a ratio of 3 or so That’s why the phone network used reservations … and why the Internet does not! 111","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
