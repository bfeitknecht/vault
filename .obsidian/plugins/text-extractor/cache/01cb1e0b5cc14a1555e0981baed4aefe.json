q Should the programmer be concerned about the size of code/data blocks fitting physical memory? q Should the programmer manage data movement from disk to physical memory? q Multiple programs may need the physical memory q Should the programmer make sure all processes (different programs) can fit in physical memory? q Should the programmer ensure two processes do not unintentionally or incorrectly use the same physical memory portion? n ISA can have an address space greater than the physical memory size q E.g., a 64-bit address space with byte addressability à 16 ExaBytes q What if you do not have enough physical memory? 11 Difficulties of Direct Physical Addressing n Programmer needs to manage physical memory space q Inconvenient & difficult q More difficult when you have multiple processes n Difficult to support code and data relocation q Addresses are directly specified in the program n Difficult to support multiple processes (esp. concurrently) q Protection and isolation between multiple processes q Sharing of physical memory space without problems n Difficult to support data/code sharing across processes q Different processes need to reference the same physical address 12 Virtual Memory n Idea: Give each program the illusion of a large address space while having a small physical memory q So that the programmer does not worry about managing physical memory (within a process or across processes) n Programmer can assume they have “infinite” amount of physical memory n Hardware and software cooperatively and automatically manage the physical memory space to provide the illusion q Illusion is maintained for each independent process 13 Basic Mechanism n Indirection and mapping (of addresses) n Address generated by each instruction in a program is a “virtual address” q i.e., it is not the physical address used to address main memory q called “linear address” in x86 n An “address translation” mechanism maps this address to a “physical address” q called “real address” in x86 q Address translation mechanism can be implemented in hardware and software together 14 Virtual Memory: Conceptual View n Illusion of large, separate address space per process 15 Kim & Mutlu, “Memory Systems,” Computing Handbook, 2014 https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/pub/memory-systems-introduction_computing-handbook14.pdf Process 1 Process 2 Requires indirection and mapping between virtual and physical address spaces 16 A System with Virtual Memory (Page-based) n Address Translation: The hardware converts virtual addresses into physical addresses via an OS-managed lookup table (page table) CPU 0: 1: N-1: Memory 0: 1: P-1: Page Table Disk Virtual Addresses Physical Addressesvirtualvirtualphysical Process 1 Process 24GB4GB16MB Virtual Page Virtual Page Physical Page Mapping Page-based Virtual-to-Physical MappingFour Issues in Indirection and Mapping n When to map a virtual address to a physical address? q When the virtual address is first referenced by the program n What is the mapping granularity? q Byte? Kilo-byte? Mega-byte? Giga-byte? … q Multiple granularities? n Where and how to store the virtualàphysical mappings? q Operating system data structures? Hardware? Cooperative? n What to do when physical address space is full? q Evict an unlikely-to-be-needed virtual address from physical memory 18 Virtual Pages, Physical Frames n Virtual address space divided into pages n Physical address space divided into frames n A virtual page is mapped to q A physical frame, if the page is in physical memory q A location in disk, otherwise n If an accessed virtual page is not in memory, but on disk q Virtual memory system brings the page into a physical frame and adjusts the mapping à this is called demand paging n Page table is the table that stores the mapping of virtual pages to physical frames 19 Physical Memory as a Cache n In other words… n Physical memory is a cache for pages stored on disk q In fact, it is a fully-associative cache in modern systems (a virtual page can potentially be mapped to any physical frame) n Similar caching issues exist as we have covered earlier: q Placement: where and how to place/find a page in cache? q Replacement: what page to remove to make room in cache? q Granularity of management: large, small, uniform pages? q Write policy: what do we do about writes? Write back? 20 Cache/Virtual Memory Analogues Cache Virtual Memory Block Page Block Size Page Size Block Offset Page Offset Miss Page Fault Index Virtual Page Number Metadata (Tag) Store Page Table Data Store Physical Memory 21 Virtual Memory Definitions n Page size: the mapping granularity of virtualàphysical address spaces q dictates the amount of data transferred from hard disk to DRAM at once n Page table: table that stores virtualàphysical page mappings q lookup table used to translate virtual page addresses to physical frame addresses (and find where the associated data is) n Address translation: the process of determining the physical address from the virtual address 22 Virtual to Physical Mapping n Most accesses hit in physical memory n Programs see the large capacity of virtual memory 23H&H, Chapter 8.4 Address Translation 24H&H, Chapter 8.4 Virtual Memory Example n System: q Virtual memory size: 2 GB = 231 bytes q Physical memory size: 128 MB = 227 bytes q Page size: 4 KB = 212 bytes 25 Virtual Memory Example (Continued) n System: q Virtual memory size: 2 GB = 231 bytes q Physical memory size: 128 MB = 227 bytes q Page size: 4 KB = 212 bytes n Organization: q Virtual address: 31 bits q Physical address: 27 bits q Page offset: 12 bits q # Virtual pages = 231/212 = 219 (VPN = 19 bits) q # Physical pages = 227/212 = 215 (PPN = 15 bits) 26 Virtual Memory Example (Continued) 27H&H, Chapter 8.4 How Do We Translate Addresses?

HW vs. SW? n What should be done on a page fault? q What virtual page to replace from physical memory? q Who handles the page fault? HW vs. SW? 125126 Speeding up Translation with a TLB n A cache of address translations q Avoids accessing the page table on every memory access n Index = lower bits of VPN (virtual page #) n Tag = unused bits of VPN + process ID n Data = a page-table entry n Status = valid, dirty The usual cache design choices (placement, replacement policy, multi-level, etc.) apply here too. Handling TLB Misses n The TLB is small; it cannot hold all PTEs q Some translation requests will inevitably miss in the TLB q Must access memory to find the required PTE n Called walking the page table n Large performance penalty n Better TLB management & prefetching can reduce TLB misses n Who handles TLB misses? q Hardware or software? Handling TLB Misses (II) n Approach #1. Hardware-Managed (e.g., x86) q The hardware does the page walk q The hardware fetches the PTE and inserts it into the TLB n If the TLB is full, the entry replaces another entry q Done transparently to system software q Can employ specialized structures and caches n E.g., page walkers and page walk caches n Approach #2. Software-Managed (e.g., MIPS) q The hardware raises an exception q The operating system does the page walk q The operating system fetches the PTE q The operating system inserts/evicts entries in the TLB Handling TLB Misses (III) n Hardware-Managed TLB + No exception on TLB miss. Instruction just stalls + Independent instructions may execute and help tolerate latency + No extra instructions/data brought into caches -- Page directory/table organization is fetched into the system: OS has little flexibility in deciding these n Software-Managed TLB + The OS can define the page table oganization + More sophisticated TLB replacement policies are possible -- Need to generate an exception à performance overhead due to pipeline flush, exception handler execution, extra instructions brought to caches Three Major Issues in Virtual Memory 1.
