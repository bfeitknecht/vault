Performing the same row operations on b as well yields b =   −6 −15 8   →   6 3 2   →   4 −1 −10   →   1 0 −1   =: c. From the lecture, we know that Ax = b ⇐⇒ Rx = c for all x ∈ R4. The only free variable is x4. In particular, we can rewrite our system as I3   x1 x2 x3   = c −   −6 1 −2   [x4] = c − x4   −6 1 −2   =   1 + 6x4 −x4 −1 + 2x4   where   −6 1 −2   =: F (so that we can compare with the explanation in the blackboard notes). Therefore, the full set of solutions is L = {     1 + 6x4 −x4 −1 + 2x4 x4     ∈ R4 : x4 ∈ R}. b) The nullspace of A contains the solutions to Ax = 0. Equivalently, these are the solutions to Rx = 0 with the R from the previous subtask. As above, we can rearrange this system to I3   x1 x2 x3   = 0 −   −6 1 −2   [x4] = −x4   −6 1 −2   =   6x4 −x4 2x4   where we again have [ −6 1 −2]⊤ = F . Following the blackboard notes, we can obtain one basis vector of N(A) from each free variable. In this case, we only have a single free variable. Setting it to 1 yields the solution x = [ 6 −1 2 1 ]⊤. We conclude that this single vector is a basis of N(A). In words, this means that every vector in N(A) can be obtained from this basis vector. Now consider the column space of A. By definition, it is spanned by the columns of A. In order to find a basis for it, we have to find an independent subset of these columns that still spans the same space. Equivalently, we have to find the CR decomposition of A. Luckily, we already found R. Moreover, we know from the lecture (Section 3.2.2 in the blackboard notes) 1 that C can now be found by taking those columns in A that have a pivot in R. Concretely, in our case R has pivots in the first three columns. Hence, we get C =   −1 2 5 −3 3 12 1 −14 −7   . The columns v1 = [ −1 −3 1]⊤ , v2 = [2 3 −14 ]⊤ , v3 = [ 5 12 −7]⊤ of C are a basis of C(A). c) Recall that the dimension of a subspace is the size of its basis. For N(A), we got 1 basis vector and hence N(A) has dimension 1. Similarly, C(A) has dimension 3. In particular, A has rank r = 3 and this allows us to calculate the dimensions of C(A⊤) and N(A⊤) using the formulas from the lecture as well: the dimension of C(A⊤) is r = 3 while the dimension of N(A⊤) is m − r = 0 where m is the number of rows of A. d) Recall that row operations preserve the row space and hence we have R(A) = R(R). More- over, all rows of R are linearly independent by construction. Hence, the rows of R form a basis of R(A). Concretely, a basis of R(A) is given by the three vectors     1 0 0 −6     ,     0 1 0 1     ,     0 0 1 −2     ∈ R 4. 2. a) The key insight here is to use v⊤v = v · v = ∥ v ∥2 = 1. We then get A2 = (vv⊤)(vv⊤) = v(v⊤v)v⊤ = v1v⊤ = vv⊤ = A for A2 and therefore P 2 = (I − A)2 = I 2 − 2A + A2 = I − 2A + A = I − A = P for P 2. b) Knowing that w · v = 0, we compute Aw = (vv⊤)w = v(v⊤w) = v(v · w) = (v · w)v = 0v = 0. c) We are given Aw = 0 and hence get 0 = Aw = (vv⊤)w = v(v⊤w) = v(v · w) = (v · w)v. Note that v · w is a scalar and that v ̸= 0. From (v · w)v = 0 we hence get v · w = 0, as desired. d) Combining subtasks b) and c), we get that for all w ∈ R3, we have Aw = 0 if and only if v · w = 0. Hence, the nullspace of A is given by N(A) = {w ∈ R3 : w · v = 0}. In words, this is the set of all vectors orthogonal to v, which is a hyperplane. e) Observe that A has the form A =   | | | v1v v2v v3v | | |   where v = [v1 v2 v3]⊤. Hence, we have C(A) = Span(v). By v ̸= 0, we conclude that A has rank 1. Therefore, it is not invertible. Note that we have studied matrices of rank 1 before in Exercise 3 of Assignment 2. 2 f) We first prove C(A) ⊆ {αv : α ∈ R}. Let w ∈ C(A) be arbitrary. By definition of C(A), there exists x with Ax = w. We conclude w = Ax = vv⊤x = (v ·x)v = αv for α = v ·x. Thus, w ∈ {αv : α ∈ R}. It remains to prove {αv : α ∈ R} ⊆ C(A). Let w ∈ {αv : α ∈ R} be arbitrary, i.e. w = αv for some α ∈ R. Choosing x = w, we get Ax = vv⊤x = vv⊤(αv) = α(v · v)v = αv = w and therefore w ∈ C(A). g) By subtask f), it suffices to prove {αv : α ∈ R} = {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w}. To see that {αv : α ∈ R} ⊆ {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w}, observe that A(αv) = αv (we have calculated this in more detail already above) and hence αv ∈ {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w} for all α. It remains to prove {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w} ⊆ {αv : α ∈ R}. By definition, any w ∈ {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w} is also in C(A). Hence, {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w} ⊆ C(A) and with subtask f) we conclude the proof. h) Let w ∈ R3 be arbitrary. We have P w = 0 ⇐⇒ (I − A)w = 0 ⇐⇒ w − Aw = 0 ⇐⇒ Aw = w. This implies N(P ) = {w ∈ R3 : Aw = w} and by subtask g) we conclude N(P ) = C(A). i) We start by proving C(P ) ⊆ N(A). Let w ∈ C(P ) be arbitrary. By definition, there is x ∈ R3 with P x = w. We use this to compute Aw as Aw = A(P x) = A(I − A)x = (A − A2)x = (A − A)x = 0 and conclude w ∈ N(A). It remains to prove N(A) ⊆ C(P ). Let w ∈ N(A) be arbitrary. By definition, we have Aw = 0. Choosing x = w, we get P x = (I − A)x = x − Ax = w − Aw = w. We conclude w ∈ C(P ). 3. a) Let v1, v2 denote the columns of A. We can rewrite A [1 0 ] =   1 1 2   to 1v1 + 0v2 =   1 1 2   which immediately yields v1 = [ 1 1 2 ]⊤. Similarly, we get A [1 1 ] = 1v1 + 1v2 =   2 3 2   and hence v2 =   2 3 2   − v1 =   1 2 0   . We conclude that A =   1 1 1 2 2 0   . 3 b) Observe that A has m = 3 rows, n = 2 columns, and rank r = 2 (since the two columns of A are linearly independent). From the lecture, we know that the dimension of C(A) is r = 2, the dimension of C(A⊤) is r = 2, the dimension of N(A) is n − r = 0, and the dimension of N(A⊤) is m − r = 1. 4. For every matrix A = [aij]m, m i=1,j=1 ∈ Rm×m, let flatten(A) ∈ Rm2 denote the vector               a11 a12 ... a1m a21 a22 ... amm               ∈ R m2 obtained by concatenating the row vectors of A. Now consider the vector flatten(I) ∈ Rm2 obtained by flattening the identity matrix. Observe that, for all A ∈ Rm×m, we have Tr(A) = 0 if and only if flatten(A) · flatten(I) = 0, where · denotes the scalar product in Rm2. Thus, we can rewrite S as S = {A ∈ R m×m : flatten(A) · flatten(I) = 0}. Looking at this definition of S, we can see that it is a hyperplane of Rm2 (since flatten(I) ̸= 0). Using our insights from assignment 6, we thus conclude that the dimension of S is m2 − 1. 5. a) Assume that S is not a single point and not a triangle. We will prove that it then has to be a line segment. Since S is not a single point, two of its vertices must be distinct. Without loss of generality, assume it is v1 and v2, i.e. v1 ̸= v2. We also know that S is not a triangle. Hence, either we immediately get that S is a line segment and we are done, or we have that not all three vertices v1, v2, v3 are distinct. Without loss of generality assume v3 = v2. Then S can be described by just using v1 and v2 as S = {λ1v1 + λ2v2 + λ3v3 : λ1, λ2, λ3 ∈ R+ 0 , λ1 + λ2 + λ3 = 1} = {λ1v1 + (λ2 + λ3)v2 : λ1, λ2, λ3 ∈ R + 0 , λ1 + (λ2 + λ3) = 1} = {λ1v1 + λ23v2 : λ1, λ23 ∈ R+ 0 , λ1 + λ23 = 1}. Notice that we still have v1 ̸= v2 and hence S is a line segment. b) Observe that A has rank 0 if and only if it is 0, i.e. A = 0. But by definition, this is equivalent to saying that v1 = v2 = v3 which is again equivalent to S being a single point. This proves both directions. c) We prove both directions individually. “ =⇒ ” Assume that S is not a triangle. Similar to the argument form a), this implies that we can express one of the three vectors as a convex combination of the others. Assume first that it is v1, i.e. we have v1 = µ1v2 + µ2v3 with µ1, µ2 ∈ R + 0 such that µ1 + µ2 = 1. Then µ1(v2 − v1) + µ2(v3 − v1) = 0 is a non-trivial linear combination of the columns of A proving that it cannot have rank 2. Thus, assume now instead that v2 can be written as convex combination of v1 and v3, i.e. v2 = µ1v1 + µ2v3 4 with µ1, µ2 ∈ R + 0 such that µ1 + µ2 = 1. In this case, −(v2 − v1) + µ2(v3 − v1) = −v2 + µ1v1 + µ2v3 = 0 is a non-trivial linear combination of the columns of A. The case where v3 can be written as convex combination of v1 and v2 is symmetric. In all three cases, we get that A cannot have rank 2. This concludes the argument. “ ⇐= ” Assume now that A does not have rank 2. Without loss of generality, assume that there exists λ ∈ R with λ(v2 − v1) = v3 − v1. We distinguish cases based on the value of λ: – If λ ≥ 1, we can write v2 as convex combination v2 = 1 λ v3 + (1 − 1 λ )v1. Thus S is not a triangle. – If 1 > λ > 0, we can write v3 as convex combination v3 = λv2 + (1 − λ)v1. Thus S is not a triangle. – If λ = 0, we have v3 = v1 and immediately conclude that S is not a triangle. – If λ < 0, we can write v1 as convex combination v1 = − λ 1−λ v2 + 1 1−λ v3. Thus S is not a triangle. This concludes the argument. d) We prove both directions individually. “ =⇒ ” Assume that A has rank 1. By subtasks b) and c) we get that S cannot be a single point and it also cannot be a triangle. Hence, S must be a line segment by subtask a). “ ⇐= ” Assume that S is a line segment. By subtasks b) and c) we know that A cannot have rank 0 and it also cannot have rank 2. We conclude that is must have rank 1. 6. 1. Which of the following statements is true for all m × m matrices A? √ (a) N(A) = N(2A) Explanation: We know from the lecture that the nullspace of an m × m matrix is a subspace of Rm. In particular, any nullspace is closed under scalar multiplication. Therefore, N(A) = N(2A). (b) N(A) = N(A2) Explanation: Let x ∈ Rm be arbitrary. If we have Ax = 0, we also get A2x = 0. But the converse is not necessarily true. Consider the 2 × 2 matrix A = [0 1 0 0 ]. Clearly, there exists x ∈ R2 with Ax ̸= 0 and hence N(A) ̸= R2. But we have A2 = 0 and therefore N(A2) = R2. (c) N(A) = N(A + I) Explanation: Consider again the matrix A = [0 1 0 0 ]. The matrix A + I has rank 2 while the matrix A has rank 1. Therefore, their nullspaces cannot be the same. (d) N(A) = N(A⊤) Explanation: For A = [0 1 0 0 ] we get A⊤ = [0 0 1 0 ]. Now consider the standard unit vector e2 ∈ R2. We have Ae2 = e1 ̸= 0 and A⊤e2 = 0 and therefore N(A) ̸= N(A⊤). 5 2. Which of the following statements is true for all square matrices A? √ (a) C(A) = C(2A) Explanation: We know that the column space of an m × m matrix is a subspace of Rm. In particular, any column space is closed under scalar multiplication. Therefore, C(A) = C(2A). (b) C(A) = C(A2) Explanation: For A = [0 1 0 0 ] we get A2 = 0. As before, this implies that A has rank 1 while A2 has rank 0 and hence they have different column spaces (the dimensions of the column spaces must be different, so the spaces themselves must be different as well). (c) C(A) = C(A + I) Explanation: For A = [0 1 0 0 ] we get that A has rank 1 while A + I has rank 2. Therefore, the two column spaces must be different. (d) C(A) = C(A⊤) Explanation: The column space of A = [0 1 0 0 ] is spanned by the standard unit vector e1 while the column space of A⊤ is spanned by the standard unit vector e2. In particular, we have e1 ∈ C(A) but e1 /∈ C(A⊤). 3. The following equations each describe a plane in R3: x − y − z = 0 2x − 5y + 3z = 0 3x + 4z = 0. Which of the following statements is true? (a) The intersection of all three planes is empty. √ (b) The intersection of all three planes contains exactly one element. (c) The intersection of all three planes is a line. Explanation: For a point to be in the intersection of all three planes, it has to be a solution to all three equations. Thus, we want to understand the set of solutions of the linear system A   x y z   =   1 −1 −1 2 −5 3 3 0 4     x y z   = 0. As it turns out, A has full rank (i.e. its rank is 3) and hence this linear system has a unique solution (which is the zero-vector). Therefore, the intersection of all three planes contains exactly one element. 6 4. Consider the linear system x1 + (b − 1)x2 = 3 −3x1 − (2b − 8)x2 = −5 with variables x1, x2 and parameter b ∈ R. For which values of b is the set of solutions to the above system empty (i.e. there is no solution)? (a) Only for b = 0. √ (b) Only for b = −5. (c) For all possible values of b (i.e. for all of R). (d) The system always has a solution regardless of the value of b. Explanation: Adding the first equation 3 times to the second equation, we get (3b−3−2b+8)x2 = 4 and thus (b + 5)x2 = 4. This equation has a solution whenver b ̸= −5. But there is no solution if b = −5. 7","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
