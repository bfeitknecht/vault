This relation is not reﬂexive, since (1, 1) ̸∈ < ◦ |. Moreover, it is not symmetric, because (1, 2) ∈ < ◦ |, but (2, 1) ̸∈ < ◦ |. This relation is transitive. For any (a, b, c), assume that there exist some x and y, such that a < x, x | b, b < y and y | c. From x | b it follows that x ≤ b, hence, a < x ≤ b < y. Therefore, a < y and y | c. b) Two numbers (a, b) are in the relation whenever a | b or a ≡2 b. This relation is reﬂexive, since for any a, we have a ≡2 a (alternatively, one could use the fact that a | a). It is, however, not symmetric, because (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ ≡2, but (2, 1) ̸∈ | ∪ ≡2. It is also not transitive, since (3, 1) ∈ | ∪ ≡2 and (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ ≡2, but (3, 2) ̸∈ | ∪ ≡2. c) Two numbers (a, b) are in the relation whenever a | b or b | a. This relation is reﬂexive, since for any a, we have a | a. It is also symmetric, because for any (a, b), we trivially have a | b or b | a if and only if b | a or a | b. The relation is, however, not transitive, since (3, 1) ∈ | ∪ |−1 and (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ |−1 but (3, 2) ̸∈ | ∪ |−1. 5.3 A False Proof a) For an arbitrary x ∈ A, there does not always exist a y ∈ A such that x ρ y. b) Consider the following counterexample: A = {1, 2} and ρ = {(1, 1)}. The relation ρ is symmetric and transitive. However, it is not reﬂexive, since 2 ρ 2 does not hold. 5.4 An Equivalence Relation a) We prove that ∼ satisﬁes all properties of an equivalence relation. Reﬂexivity: For any point (x, y) ∈ R2 \\ {(0, 0)}, we have (x, y) ∼ (x, y), because one can choose λ = 1 in the deﬁnition of ∼. Symmetry: Let x1, y1, x2, y2 ∈ R \\ {0} and assume that (x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2). It follows that x1 = λx2 and y1 = λy2 for some λ > 0. Hence, x2 = 1 λ x1 and y2 = 1 λ y1, where 1 λ > 0. Therefore, (x2, y2) ∼ (x1, y1). Transitivity: Let x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ∈ R \\ {0} and assume that (x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2) and (x2, y2) ∼ (x3, y3). This means that (x1, y1) = (λ1x2, λ1y2) and (x2, y2) = (λ2x3, λ2y3) for some λ1, λ2 > 0. It follows that (x1, y1) = (λx3, λy3), where λ > 0 is deﬁned as λ1λ2. Hence, (x1, y1) ∼ (x3, y3). b) An equivalence class [(x, y)]∼ contains all points on the ray through the origin (0, 0) and the point (x, y) (excluding the origin). Note that no equivalence class can contain the origin (0, 0) (∼ is only deﬁned on R2 \\ {(0, 0)}). 5.5 Order Relations on Quotient Sets To show that (A/θ, ρ) is a partial order we need to show that the relation ρ is reﬂexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Notice that for all a ∈ A the element least([a]θ) is well-deﬁned because [a]θ ̸= ∅. Indeed, since θ is an equivalence relation, it is reﬂexive, so that a θ a and a ∈ [a]θ, by deﬁnition of [a]θ. • Reﬂexivity: Let [a]θ ∈ A/θ. One has [a]θ ρ [a]θ · ⇐⇒ least([a]θ) ≤ least([a]θ) (Deﬁnition of ρ) · ⇐⇒ true. (Reﬂexivity of ≤) • Antisymmetry: Let [a]θ, [b]θ ∈ A/θ. We have ([a]θ ρ [b]θ) ∧ ([b]θ ρ [a]θ) · ⇐⇒ (least([a]θ) ≤ least([b]θ) ) ∧ (least([b]θ) ≤ least([a]θ) ) (Deﬁnition of ρ, twice) · =⇒ least([a]θ) = least([b]θ) (Antyisymmetry of ≤) · =⇒ [a]θ ∩ [b]θ ̸= ∅ (Deﬁnition of ∩) · =⇒ [a]θ = [b]θ. (Theorem 3.11) • Transitivity: Let [a]θ, [b]θ, [c]θ ∈ A/θ. We have ([a]θ ρ [b]θ) ∧ ([b]θ ρ [c]θ) · ⇐⇒ (least([a]θ) ≤ least([b]θ) ) ∧ (least([b]θ) ≤ least([c]θ)) (Deﬁnition of ρ, twice) · =⇒ least([a]θ) ≤ least([c]θ) (Transitivity of ≤) · =⇒ [a]θ ρ [c]θ. (Deﬁnition of ρ) 5.6 Lifting an Operation to Equivalence Classes a) We deﬁne the function sum : A2 → A by sum((a, b), (c, d)) def = (ad + bc, bd). Observe that bd ̸= 0 since b ̸= 0 and d ̸= 0. b) f is θ-consistent if and only if (b1 θ b ′ 1 and b2 θ b ′ 2) =⇒ f (b1, b2) θ f (b ′ 1, b ′ 2) is true for all b1, b2, b′ 1, b′ 2 ∈ B. Alternatively (and equivalently) we could say that f is θ-consistent if and only if ([b1]θ = [b ′ 1]θ and [b2]θ = [b ′ 2]θ) =⇒ [f (b1, b2)]θ = [f (b ′ 1, b ′ 2)]θ is true for all b1, b2, b′ 1, b′ 2 ∈ B. c) Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈ A be arbitrary. We have (a, b) ∼ (a ′, b ′) and (c, d) ∼ (c ′, d ′) · ⇐⇒ ab′ = ba ′ and cd ′ = dc ′ (def. ∼) · =⇒ ab ′ · dd ′ + cd ′ · bb ′ = ba′ · dd ′ + dc ′ · bb ′ · ⇐⇒ ad · b ′d′ + bc · b ′d ′ = bd · a′d ′ + bd · b ′c ′ (comm.) · ⇐⇒ (ad + bc) · b ′d ′ = bd · (a ′d ′ + b ′c ′) (distr.) · ⇐⇒ (ad + bc, bd) ∼ (a′d ′ + b ′c ′, b ′d ′) (def. ∼) · ⇐⇒ sum((a, b), (c, d)) ∼ sum((a′, b ′), (c ′, d ′)). (def. sum) Hence, sum is ∼-consistent.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
