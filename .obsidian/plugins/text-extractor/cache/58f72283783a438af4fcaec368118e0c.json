Let Ω := {ω1, ω2, ω3}. Which of the following does not define a σ-algebra on Ω? (Exactly one answer is correct.) (a) F1 := {∅, Ω}. (b) F2 := {∅, {ω1}, {ω2, ω3}, Ω}. (c) F3 := {{ω1}, {ω2}, {ω3} }. (d) F4 := {∅, {ω1}, {ω2}, {ω3}, {ω1, ω2}, {ω1, ω3}, {ω2, ω3}, Ω}. MC 1.3. Let Ω := {0, 1}, and F := 2Ω. Which of the following define a probability measure on Ω? (The number of correct answers is between 0 and 4.) (a) P[∅] = P[{0}] = P[{1}] = P[{0, 1}] = 1 4 . (b) P[∅] = P[{0}] = P[{1}] = 0 and P[{0, 1}] = 1.

[Settlers of Catan] We are playing the board game Settlers of Catan. The game board consists of landscapes that are labeled with integers between 2 and 6 or between 8 and 12. In each round, two dice are rolled and those landscapes whose number matches the sum of the dice rolls yield resources. (a) Define the sample space Ω := {(w1, w2) | w1, w2 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}. Identify the event {the landscapes with number 9 yield resources} as a subset of Ω. (b) Which landscapes (i.e., which numbers) are expected to yield resources most frequently and least frequently? Why? (c) A player has a choice: Either they receive future resources from a landscape with number 8 or from both landscapes with number 4 and 12. What should they choose and why? (We assume that the type of resource does not influence the decision.) 1 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Exercise 1.5. [Biased coins] We assume that we have two biased coins, gold and silver, in an urn. The probability that the gold coin lands on heads is pg ∈ (0, 1), and for silver, it is ps ∈ (0, 1). In each trial, a coin is drawn from the urn, tossed, and then returned to the urn. We conduct the random experiment twice. (a) Specify an appropriate probability space (Ω, F, P). (We assume that the gold and silver coin are each drawn with probability 1/2.) (b) Which element of F corresponds to the event A = {The first coin drawn is silver}. (c) Which element of F corresponds to the event B = {Heads is obtained twice}. (d) Compute P[A], P[B], and P[A ∩ B]. Exercise 1.6. [Properties of a σ-algebra] (a) [De Morgan’s Law] Let (Ai)i≥1 be a sequence of arbitrary sets. Show that the following holds: ( ∞⋃ i=1 Ai )c = ∞⋂ i=1(Ai)c. Let F be a σ-algebra on Ω. (b) Show that ∅ ∈ F. (c) Let (Ai)i≥1 be a sequence of events, i.e., Ai ∈ F for all i ≥ 1. Show that ∞⋂ i=1 Ai ∈ F. (d) Let A, B ∈ F. Show that A ∪ B ∈ F. (e) Let A, B ∈ F. Show that A ∩ B ∈ F. Exercise 1.7. [Properties of a probability measure] Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space. (a) Show that P[∅] = 0. (b) Let k ≥ 1, and let A1, . . . , Ak be k pairwise disjoint events. Show that P[A1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ak] = P[A1] + · · · + P[Ak]. (c) Let A be an event. Show that P[Ac] = 1 − P[A]. (d) Let A and B be two arbitrary events (not necessarily disjoint). Show that the addition rule P[A ∪ B] = P[A] + P[B] − P[A ∩ B] holds. 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
