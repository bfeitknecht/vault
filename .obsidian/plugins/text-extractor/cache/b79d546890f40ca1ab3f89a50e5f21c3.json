This booklet consists of 4 pages; the back page of this booklet is page 4. After the quiz begins, check that your quiz papers are complete (2 assignments). 2. Only write on the quiz paper and extra paper sheets which are given by the assistants. Do not take any of this paper out of the quiz: submit it all. Write your ﬁrst and last name and your student number on every sheet of paper that you write on. 3. This is a closed book quiz: the only resources allowed are pen and paper. No laptops, no cell phones, no smart watches, no prepared notes. Do not use pencil and do not use red. 4. You may use any functions from the Haskell Prelude in your solutions (without giving their deﬁnitions). 5. Write clearly in the sense of logic, language, and readability. Label all rule applications in your derivation trees. The clarity of your arguments and explanations aﬀects your grade. 6. You have 30 minutes to complete the quiz.

A(x) ∀I ∗ Γ Ø ∀x. A(x) Γ Ø A(t) ∀E Γ Ø A(t) Γ Ø ∃x. A(x) ∃I Γ Ø ∃x. A(x) Γ, A(x) Ø B Γ Ø B ∃E ∗∗ Side conditions: (∗) x does not occur free in any formula in Γ, (∗∗) x does neither occur free in any formula in Γ nor in B. Prove using the above rules that (∃y. ∀x. Q(y) ∨ P (x)) → ∀x. ∃y. ¬Q(y) → P (x) holds. Label each inference step with the name of the corresponding rule. Formal Methods and Functional Programming, Quiz 1, SS19 3 Solution: Let • Γ1 ∶= ∃y. ∀x. Q(y) ∨ P (x) • Γ2 ∶= Γ1, ∀x. Q(y) ∨ P (x) • Γ3 ∶= Γ2, ¬Q(y) • Γ4 ∶= Γ3, Q(y) • Γ5 ∶= Γ3, P (x) Γ1 Ø ∃y. ∀x. Q(y) ∨ P (x) Ax Γ3 Ø ∀x.

Q(y) ∨ P (x)) → (∀x. ∃y. ¬Q(y) → P (x)) →I (∗): y does not occur free in Γ1 (∗∗): y does not occur free in Γ1 and ∃y. ¬Q(y) → P (x) Formal Methods and Functional Programming, Quiz 1, SS19 4 Assignment 2: Tokenization (8 points) The tokenization of a nonnegative integer n is the number obtained from n via replacing runs of consecutive equal digits d by a single digit d. For example, the tokenization of the number 11222113 equals 1213. Write a function tokenize :: Int -> Int that given a nonnegative integer n as input computes its tokenization as deﬁned above. Examples: tokenize 0 = 0 tokenize 1 = 1 tokenize 11 = 1 tokenize 11222113 = 1213 Solution: tokenize :: Int -> Int tokenize n | n < 10 = n | d’ == d = n’ | otherwise = 10 * n’ + d where n’ = tokenize (n ‘div‘ 10) d = n ‘mod‘ 10 d’ = n’ ‘mod‘ 10","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
