Proof: (using Lemma 3.15.(ii): The relation ⪰ is transitive: A ⪰ B ∧ B ⪰ C ⟹ A ⪰ C) (using Definition 3.42.(iii): A set A is called countable if A ⪰ N, and uncountable otherwise) N ⪰ A ∧ A ⪰ B ⟹ N ⪰ B ■ b) Prove: The set S = {functions {0, 1} → {0, 1}∞} is uncountable. Proof: We will prove this using contradiction. Let's assume the set S is countable, so S ∼ N. This means, that there is a one to one mapping onto each unique value (bijection) between functions fn to N. Let us define fn as follows: fn def = βn, 0, βn, 1, βn, 2, βn, 3, . . . For some n ∈ N Let βn, i be the i-th bit in the n-th sequence fn where for convenience we begin numbering the bits with i = 0. Let – b be the complement of a bit b ∈ {0, 1}. We define a new semi-infinite binary sequence α as follows: α def = βn, 0, βn, 1, βn, 2, βn, 3, . . . Obviously , α ∈ {0, 1}∞ but there is no n ∈ N such that α = fn since α is constructed so as to disagree in at least one bit (actually the i-th bit) with every sequence fn for n ∈ N. This shows that there cannot be an bijection from fn to N, which concludes the proof. W e have shown that N ⪰ S and S is thus uncountable using Cantor's diagonalization argument. ■––––","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
