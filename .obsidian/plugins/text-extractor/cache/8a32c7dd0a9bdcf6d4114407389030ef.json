Let X ∼ N (1, 4) and Y ∼ N (−1, σ2), where σ2 > 0 is unknown. What is the value of σ2 if P[X ≤ −1] = P[Y ≥ 2]? (Exactly one answer is correct.) (a) σ2 = 9. (b) σ2 = 1. (c) σ2 = 4. (d) σ2 = 2. MC 12.2. Which of the following statements about statistical tests are true? (The number of correct answers is between 0 and 4.) (a) If the null hypothesis is not rejected, we conclude that it must be true. (b) The statistical test measures the probability that the null hypothesis is true. (c) It is possible that a test rejects the null hypothesis even though it is true. However, we control the probability of this event. (d) The result of the statistical test is random. Exercise 12.3. We suspect that the consumption of sodium-rich foods has certain effects on blood pressure. Therefore, we conduct a study in which we first measure the blood pressure of 1000 individuals. These individuals then adopt a diet that is very high in sodium. After doing so, we measure their blood pressure again. Let X1, . . . , X1000 denote the random variables representing the differences in blood pressure values (after minus before). We assume that the Xi are independent with Xi ∼ N (µ, σ2), where σ2 > 0 is known, but µ ∈ R is unknown. Design a test to determine whether sodium has an effect on blood pressure. (a) Formulate the null hypothesis and the alternative. (b) Find a test statistic and the critical region at the 5% level. (c) Suppose that σ2 = 1 and ∑1000 i=1 xi = 80.2. What is the result of the test? Exercise 12.4. A pharmaceutical company is introducing a new drug and wants to conduct a study to examine whether the effectiveness of this drug exceeds 60%. To do so, they administer the drug to 1000 individuals and collect the data. For simplicity, we assume that the drug either worked or did not work for each person. (a) Find a suitable class of distributions for the random sample X1, . . . , X1000 and formulate the null and alternative hypotheses to test whether the effectiveness exceeds 60%. (b) Consider the test statistic S := ∑1000 i=1 Xi. Use an appropriate approximation for the distribution of S under the null hypothesis. 1 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek (c) Find the approximate critical region at the significance level α = 0.05. (d) In our study, the drug was effective for 650 individuals. What is the result of this test? Exercise 12.5. Assume that X1, . . . , Xn, n ∈ N, are i.i.d. random variables with E[X 2 1 ] < ∞. Let µ = E[X1] and σ2 = Var[X1]. Suggest suitable (exact or approximate) tests at level α ∈ (0, 1) for the following situations. (a) Test H0 : µ = 0 against H1 : µ ̸= 0, assuming that Xi ∼ N (µ, σ2) and the variance σ2 is known. (b) Test H0 : µ = 0 against H1 : µ ̸= 0, assuming that Xi ∼ N (µ, σ2) and the variance σ2 is unknown. (c) Test H0 : σ2 = 1 against H1 : σ2 > 1, assuming that Xi ∼ N (µ, σ2) and the mean µ ∈ R is unknown. (d) Test H0 : µ = 1 against H1 : µ < 1, assuming that the variance σ2 is known, but the distribution of Xi is unknown. (e) Test H0 : µ = 1 against H1 : µ < 1, assuming that both the variance σ2 and the distribution of Xi are unknown. Exercise 12.6. A six-sided die is to be tested for whether it is loaded and more likely to land on six. For this purpose, an experiment is conducted in which the die is rolled ten times and the result of each roll is recorded. We assume all rolls are independent and that the probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 is the same. We model the outcomes of the rolls as a sample X1, . . . , X10, where Xi = 1 indicates that the i-th roll was a six, and Xi = 0 otherwise. We obtain the following results: x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 (a) Determine a suitable model (Pθ)θ∈Θ, i.e., a parameter space and the distributions of X1, . . . , X10 under each Pθ. (b) Formulate a suitable null hypothesis H0 and alternative hypothesis H1. (c) Let T = ∑10 i=1 Xi be the test statistic. What distribution does T follow? (d) Let K = (4, 10] be the rejection region. Compute the probability of a Type I error. (e) Describe the test decision based on the observed results. Exercise 12.7. Let X1, . . . , X12 be independent and identically distributed as N (µ, σ2) under Pθ, where θ = µ is an unknown parameter. The standard deviation σ = 0.0499 is known. The following sample data are given: x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 1.00781 1.00646 1.00801 1.00833 1.00738 1.00687 x7 x8 x9 x10 x11 x12 1.00783 1.00936 1.00564 1.00543 1.00794 1.01060 We test the hypothesis H0 : µ = µ0 against the alternative H1 : µ ̸= µ0, where µ0 = 1.0085. (a) Determine a and b such that the test statistic T := 1 a ( ∑12 i=1 Xi + b) follows N (0, 1) under Pµ0. (b) Let K := (−∞, −c) ∪ (c, ∞) be the rejection region for some c ≥ 0. Test H0 against H1 at the 5% significance level. (c) Compute the power of the test at µ = 1.008. 2 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Quantile table for the standard normal distribution 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.95 0.975 0.99 0.995 0.999 0 0.6745 1.2816 1.6449 1.9600 2.3263 2.5758 3.0902 .
