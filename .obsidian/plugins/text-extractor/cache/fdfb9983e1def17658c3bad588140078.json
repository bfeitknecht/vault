To do this, we will construct a group homomorphism, ψ :H × K → G and show that it is a bijection. Let this function be deﬁned by ψ(h,k) = h ∗ k, for all (h,k) ∈ H × K. Per deﬁnition 5.9 of the direct product of groups and deﬁnition 5.11 of subgroups, we have the following. Then, per commutativity of the group G, the equality below holds for all (h1,k1),(h2,k2) ∈ H × K. Thus per deﬁnition 5.10, ψ is a group homomorphism from H × K to G. By deﬁnition i. of the carrier set G, the function ψ is surjective since ψ(H × K) = {h ∗ k ∣ h ∈ H,k ∈ K} = G. Now assume that there exists (h,k),(h′,k′) ∈ H × K such that ψ(h,k) = ψ(h′,k′). Then we prove that ψ is injective below. Since the described homomorphism ψ from H × K to G is a bijection, it's proven that the two groups are isomorphic. □ ⟨H × K;⋆⟩ = ⟨H;∗⟩ × ⟨K;∗⟩, (h1,k1) ⋆ (h2,k2) = (h1 ∗ h2,k1 ∗ k2) ∈ H × K ψ((h1,k1) ⋆ (h2,k2)) = ψ(h1 ∗ h2,k1 ∗ k2) = ψ(h1,k1) ∗ ψ(h2,k2) ψ(h,k) = ψ(h′,k′) ⋅ ⟹ ψ(h,k) ∗ ˆψ(h′,k′) = ψ(h′,k′) ∗ ˆψ(h′,k′) (def. e) ⋅ ⟹ ψ(h,k) ∗ ˆψ(h′,k′) = e (inverse of h ∗ k) ⋅ ⟹ ˆψ(h′,k′) = ˆψ(h,k) (uniqueness of inverse) ⋅ ⟹ (h,k) = (h′,k′) (def.injection) b) We need to prove, that ⟨Z∗ 15;⊙ 15⟩ ≃ Z2 × Z4. First, let's observe the elements of these groups. Since multiplication is commutative, ⟨Z∗ 15;⊙ 15⟩ is a commutative group. We notice that we can decompose the carrier set Z∗ 15 can be decomposed into two subsets H = {1,11} and K = {1,2,4,8}, such that the following holds. Then per deﬁnition 5.11, ⟨H;⊙ 15⟩ and ⟨K;⊙ 15⟩ are subgroups of ⟨Z∗ 15;⊙ 15⟩, since they are closed under the operation ⊙ 15 and its inverse and both contain the neutral element e = 1. By subtask (a) we conclude that the underlying group is isomorphic to its inner direct product, i.e. Z∗ 15 ≃ H × K. Since the composition of bijections is itself again a bijection, isomorphisms are transitive. Now let's show that H × K ≃ Z2 × Z4. The former's carrier set is given below. Then we deﬁne a bijective group homomorphism ψ :H × K → Z2 × Z4 as follows. Hence Z∗ 15 ≃ H × K ≃ Z2 × Z4 and thus Z∗ 15 ≃ Z2 × Z4. □ Z∗ 15 = {1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14} Z2 = {0,1} Z4 = {0,1,2,3} Z2 × Z4 = { } 00, 01, 02, 03 10, 11, 12, 13 Z∗ 15 = {h ⊙ 15 k ∣ h ∈ H,k ∈ K} H ∩ K = {e} = {1} H × K = { } 11, 12, 14, 18 111, 112, 114, 118 ψ(1,1) = (0,0) ψ(1,2) = (0,2) ψ(1,4) = (0,4) ψ(1,8) = (0,8) ψ(11,1) = (1,0) ψ(11,2) = (1,2) ψ(11,4) = (1,4) ψ(11,8) = (1,8)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
