We will do this in two steps: • We show that every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis. • We show that every such basis must contain the same number of elements. Thus, we can define the dimension of a finite-dimensional vector space as the number of elements in any of its bases. §1 Preliminary definitions Throughout, we assume that V is a K-vector space. Definition 1.1: Span — Let U ⊆ V . We write span(U ) to denote the set of linear combinations of the elements of U . If span(U ) = V , we say that U is a generating set of V . Definition 1.2: Finite-dimensional vector space — We say that V is finite- dimensional if there exists a finite subset G ⊆ V such that span(G) = V . From now on let V be finite-dimensional. Definition 1.3: Basis — We say a finite subset G ⊆ V is a basis of V if G is a generating set of V and if the vectors of G are linearly independent. §2 The main results Theorem 2.1: Generating sets contain a basis — Let G be a generating set of V . Then there exists a subset S ⊆ G such that S is a basis of V . Proof. As U is finite, we may choose the largest linearly independent subset T ⊆ G. • If span(T ) = V , then T is a basis. • If span(T ) ̸= V , then by definition of the span there exists some v ∈ V such that v cannot be written as a linear combinations of the elements in T , so v is linearly independent of the vectors in V . Thus, T ∪ {v} is still linearly independent, but contains more elements than T , a contradiction to the maximality of T , so this case can’t hold. 1 Joel Gerlach 2 THE MAIN RESULTS Thus, T must actually be spanning, and as it is linearly independent, it is a basis of V . From this it follows trivially that every finite-dimensional vectors space has a basis. Lemma 2.1: Exchange Lemma — Let B = v1, . . . , vn be a basis of V . Let now w ∈ V and let αi ∈ K be such that w = α1v1 + . . . + αnvn. If aj ̸= 0, then B′ = {v1, v2, . . . , vj−1, w, vj+1, . . . , vn} is also a basis of V . Proof. It suffices to show that B′ is both a generating set and linearly independent. • B′ is a generating set: We first show that vj can be written in terms of the vectors in B′. We have w =  ∑ i̸=j αivi   + αjvj ⇐⇒ vj = w αj −  ∑ i̸=j αi αj vi   so vj can be written as a linear combination of the elements in B′. Then let v ∈ V be arbitrary. Since B is a basis, there exists β1, . . . , βn such that v = ∑i βivi. Using vj from above, we have v = ∑ i (βivi) = ∑ i̸=j βivi + βjw = ∑ i̸=j βivi + βj   w αj −   ∑ i̸=j αi αj vi     = βj αj w + ∑ i̸=j ( βivi − αi αj vi ) = βj αj w + ∑ i̸=j ( βi − αi αj ) vi, so that v can be written in terms of w and vi, i ̸= j. As v ∈ V was arbitrarily chosen, every v ∈ V is a linear combination of the elements of B′. Thus, B′ is a generating set of B. • B′ is the linearly independent: Write 0 = ∑ i̸=j βivi + βjw. We claim that then βi = 0. We see that the following way: 0 = ∑ i̸=j βivi + βjw = ∑ i̸=j βivi + βj ∑ i αivi = ∑ i̸=j(βi + βjαi)vi + βjαjvj 2 Joel Gerlach 2 THE MAIN RESULTS As the vi are linearly independent, we have that βi + βjαj = 0 and βjαj = 0. Since αj ̸= 0, we have βj = 0 and thus βi = 0 for all i. Therefore, vi, i ̸= j and w are linearly independent. Thus, B′ is a linearly independent generating set of V , and thus a basis of V . Theorem 2.2: Exchange Theorem — Let B = {v1, . . . , vn} be a basis of V and let w1, . . . , wk ∈ V be linearly independent vectors. Then we have • k ≤ n • There exists n − k vectors in B that form a basis with w1, . . . , wk. Proof. We use induction. If k = 0 there is nothing to prove, if k = 1 then this is just the exchange lemma. Assume the result is true for k < n. Then we know that w1, . . . , wk form a basis with n − k > 0 elements in B. Hence wk+1 can be written as wk+1 = λ1w1 + . . . + λkwk + λk+1vk+1 + . . . + λnvn (if the indices for the vi don’t match, just re-index B). Note that not all λk+1, . . . , λn can be zero, as then wk+1 would have to be a linear combination of only the wi’s, which is impossible as the w1, . . . , wk+1 are linearly independent. Thus, some λℓ, k + 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n is non-zero and therefore, by the exchange lemma, we may replace vℓ by wk+1 to get a new basis that now contains w1, . . . , wk+1, which completes the induction step. Thus, the results holds for all n ≤ k. In particular k = n, so that any set of n linearly independent vectors wi form a basis of V , which implies that any set of k > n vectors cannot be linearly independent. Thus, k ≤ n. The final corollary is the following: Take two basis B and B′ with |B| = n and |B′| = k. By the above theorem, as B is a basis and B′ is a set of k linearly independent vectors, we have k ≤ n. Similarly, as B′ is a basis and B is a set of n linearly independent vectors, n ≤ k. Therefore, n = k, which proves that any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements. 3","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
