Then, by theorem 5.21, if R is a commutative ring, the extension R[x] is also a commutative ring. Thus the structure Z3[x] is a non-trivial commutative ring, since the additive and multiplicative identity are distinct, 0 ≠ 1. Per lemma 5.35, for a ring F [x], then F [x]m(x) is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication. Thus the algebra Z3[x]x3+2x2+1 is a ring. Finally, for a ring F its extension ﬁeld F [x]m(x) is a ﬁeld if and only if m(x) is irreducible, by theorem 5.37. Thus all that remains to show is that m(x) = x3 + 2x2 + 1 is irreducible in Z3[x]. To do this, it follows from deﬁnition 5.28 and the fact that degrees of polynomials are added under multiplication. Since the degree of the modulus polynomial is three deg(m(x)) = 3, it suﬃces to prove that it has no monic polynomial divisors. This can be expressed as (x − α) ≡ ̸m(x) 0 for all α ∈ Z3. Computations yield the following. Thus, m(x) = x3 + 2x2 + 1 is an irreducible polynomial in Z3[x] and hence F = Z3[x]x3+2x2+1 is a ﬁeld. □ b) Recall that F ∗ is the (cyclic) group of units in the ﬁnite ﬁeld F . Its order is given by the following. The elements of F ∗ are polynomials of the form a(x) = α2x2 + α1x + α0, where αi ∈ Z3, not all equal zero. By theorem 5.40, the number of generators in F ∗ is given by euler's totient function φ(|F ∗|) = 12. Since all constant polynomials only generate constant polynomials, let's consider the simplest monic polynomial with an indeterminate, g(x) = x ∈ F ∗. The computations of the powers of g(x) are given below. Rx+0(x3 + 2x2 + 1) = 1 Rx+1(x3 + 2x2 + 1) = 2 Rx+2(x3 + 2x2 + 1) = 1 |F ∗| = |F − {0}| (D. 5.26.) = |F | − 1 (L. 5.34.) = |Z3|deg(m(x)) − 1 = 33 − 1 = 26 It can be observed, that after the ﬁrst thirteen iterations, continued exponentiation repeats the additive inverses of the previous expressions. Thus, since it holds that ⟨x⟩ = F ∗, the polynomial g(x) = x is a generator ofF ∗. □ g(x) 0 = x0 ≡ m(x) 1 g(x) 1 = x1 ≡ m(x) x g(x) 2 = x2 ≡ m(x) x2 g(x) 3 = x3 ≡ m(x) x2 − 1 g(x) 4 = x4 ≡ m(x) x2 − x − 1 g(x) 5 = x5 ≡ m(x) −x − 1 g(x) 6 = x6 ≡ m(x) x2 − x g(x) 7 = x7 ≡ m(x) x2 + 1 g(x) 8 = x8 ≡ m(x) x2 + x − 1 g(x) 9 = x9 ≡ m(x) −x2 − x − 1 g(x) 10 = x10 ≡ m(x) x2 − x + 1 g(x) 11 = x11 ≡ m(x) x − 1 g(x) 12 = x12 ≡ m(x) x2 − x = −g(x) −1 g(x) 13 = x13 ≡ m(x) −1 = −g(x) 0   g(x) 14 = x14 ≡ m(x) −x = −g(x) 1   g(x) 15 = x15 ≡ m(x) −x2 = −g(x) 2   ⋮ ⋮ g(x) 25 = x25 ≡ m(x) −x2 + x = g(x) −1    g(x) 26 = x26 ≡ m(x) 1 c) Since F is a ﬁeld, and by theorem 5.24, every ﬁeld is an integral domain, F [y] is an integral domain by lemma 5.22. Its elements are the polynomials in y with coeﬃcients in F = Z3[x]m(x). This can alternatively be understood as the polynomials in two indeterminates i.e. a(x, y) ∈ Z3[x, y]m(x), as in example 5.43. Then, per deﬁnition 5.33 for a polynomial a(x, y) ∈ F [x, y] an element (α, β) ∈ F 2 is a root exactly when a(α, β) = 0. In this case, we have to ﬁnd (α, β) ∈ Z3 × Z3. The following table presents the evaluation of a(x, y). The roots are marked in yellow. (α, β) β = 0 β = 1 β = 2 α = 0 2 0 0 α = 1 0 1 0 α = 2 0 1 1 □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
