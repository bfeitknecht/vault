The graph is 2-edge-connected but there exist some vertices s.t. , namely (for the counter example provided here) and . b. i) hat Hamiltonkreis ist 2-zusammenhängend Yes, since all vertices must be in the same equivalence class of the equivalence relation on . Thus they are in the same \"block\" and there cannot exist another block, since otherwise some vertex (namely the cut vertices) would have to be visited twice. ii) ist 2-zusammenhängend hat Hamiltonkreis No, consider the grid, which is 2-connected but does not contain a hamiltonian cycle. X I think your misconception is that \"2-Karten-zusammenhanged\" means there exists a uo r separator of siz e I but that doesn't need to be the cas e . . Instead it means , that if there exists a separator it is of at least siz e 2 . I- the statematisindendcorrect, howeveryo uargumentdose instead of the verlices . ~ c. Let be 2-connected. Let be a path of length 2 in . Show that we can extend this path to a cycle, i.e. that contains a cycle in which , , and are adjacent vertices. By Satz von Menger we know that there exist internal-vertex-disjunct - -paths. We have as one such path the given -()- -path. There must hence exist one other such - -path that is internally vertex disjunct to the ﬁrst one. Connecting these two yields the desired cycle, in which , and are adjacent. ~ 1 Point Good & interesting approaches !
