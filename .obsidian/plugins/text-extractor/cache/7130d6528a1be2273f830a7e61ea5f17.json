This relation is not reflexive, since (1, 1) ̸∈ < ◦ |. Moreover, it is not symmetric, because (1, 2) ∈ < ◦ |, but (2, 1) ̸∈ < ◦ |. This relation is transitive. For any (a, b, c), assume that there exist some x and y, such that a < x, x | b, b < y and y | c. From x | b it follows that x ≤ b, hence, a < x ≤ b < y. Therefore, a < y and y | c. b) Two numbers (a, b) are in the relation whenever a | b or a ≡2 b. This relation is reflexive, since for any a, we have a ≡2 a (alternatively, one could use the fact that a | a). It is, however, not symmetric, because (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ ≡2, but (2, 1) ̸∈ | ∪ ≡2. It is also not transitive, since (3, 1) ∈ | ∪ ≡2 and (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ ≡2, but (3, 2) ̸∈ | ∪ ≡2. c) Two numbers (a, b) are in the relation whenever a | b or b | a. This relation is reflexive, since for any a, we have a | a. It is also symmetric, because for any (a, b), we trivially have a | b or b | a if and only if b | a or a | b. The relation is, however, not transitive, since (3, 1) ∈ | ∪ |−1 and (1, 2) ∈ | ∪ |−1 but (3, 2) ̸∈ | ∪ |−1. 5.3 A False Proof a) For an arbitrary x ∈ A, there does not always exist a y ∈ A such that x ρ y. b) Consider the following counterexample: A = {1, 2} and ρ = {(1, 1)}. The relation ρ is symmetric and transitive. However, it is not reflexive, since 2 ρ 2 does not hold. 5.4 An Equivalence Relation a) We prove that ∼ satisfies all properties of an equivalence relation. Reflexivity: For any point (x, y) ∈ R2 \\ {(0, 0)}, we have (x, y) ∼ (x, y), because one can choose λ = 1 in the definition of ∼. Symmetry: Let x1, y1, x2, y2 ∈ R \\ {0} and assume that (x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2). It follows that x1 = λx2 and y1 = λy2 for some λ > 0. Hence, x2 = 1 λ x1 and y2 = 1 λ y1, where 1 λ > 0. Therefore, (x2, y2) ∼ (x1, y1). Transitivity: Let x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ∈ R \\ {0} and assume that (x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2) and (x2, y2) ∼ (x3, y3). This means that (x1, y1) = (λ1x2, λ1y2) and (x2, y2) = (λ2x3, λ2y3) for some λ1, λ2 > 0. It follows that (x1, y1) = (λx3, λy3), where λ > 0 is defined as λ1λ2. Hence, (x1, y1) ∼ (x3, y3). b) An equivalence class [(x, y)]∼ contains all points on the ray through the origin (0, 0) and the point (x, y) (excluding the origin). Note that no equivalence class can contain the origin (0, 0) (∼ is only defined on R2 \\ {(0, 0)}). 5.5 Properties of Relations a) The claim is false. We prove this by a counter example: In particular, we show that there exists a relation ρ on a set A such that ρ2 is symmetric on A but ρ is not sym- metric on A. Let A = {0, 1, 2, 3} and ρ be defined on A by a ρ b def ⇐⇒ b ≡4 a + 1. Then clearly ρ is not symmetric, as for a = 0 and b = 1 we have a ρ b, but b ρ a is false as 0 ̸≡4 2. On the other hand, we have for arbitrary a, b ∈ A a ρ 2 b · ⇐⇒ ∃c (a ρ c ∧ c ρ b) · ⇐⇒ ∃c (c ≡4 a + 1 ∧ b ≡4 c + 1) · ⇐⇒ ∃c (c + 2 ≡4 a + 3 ∧ b + 2 ≡4 c + 3) [justification: add 2 on both sides] · ⇐⇒ ∃d (d ≡4 a + 3 ∧ b ≡4 d + 3) [justification: let d ∈ A such that d ≡4 c + 2] · ⇐⇒ ∃d (b ≡4 d + 3 ∧ d ≡4 a + 3) · ⇐⇒ ∃d (d ≡4 b + 1 ∧ a ≡4 d + 1) · ⇐⇒ ∃d (b ρ d ∧ d ρ a) · ⇐⇒ b ρ 2 a. Hence, ρ2 is symmetric. b) The claim is false. We prove this by a counter example: In particular, we show that there exists a relation ρ on a set A such that ρ is symmetric and antisymmetric, but ρ ̸= idA. (In fact, one can show that for any relation ρ on a set A it holds: If ρ is symmetric and antisymmetric, then ρ ⊆ idA; but, as noted above, equality does not necessarily hold.) A simple counter example is A being an arbitrary non-empty set and ρ = ∅, i.e. a ρ b is false for all a, b ∈ A. It follows immediately from the definitions of symmetric and antisymmetric relations that ρ satisfies both required properties: For any a, b ∈ A we have a ρ b · ⇐⇒ (a, b) ∈ ρ · ⇐⇒ (b, a) ∈ ρ · ⇐⇒ b ρ a, hence, ρ is symmetric. On the other hand, since a ρ b and b ρ a are both false for any a, b ∈ A, it holds that (a ρ b ∧ b ρ a) =⇒ a = b for all a, b ∈ A. Hence, ρ is also antisymmetric. c) The claim is true. As ρ is a relation on Z, hence ρ2 ⊆ Z × Z by definition, it suffices to show that Z × Z ⊆ ρ2. This is equivalent to showing that for all a, b ∈ Z it holds (a, b) ∈ ρ2. We show this by case distinction over the cases a ≡2 b and a ̸≡2 b. Clearly, one of these cases must be true for any (a, b) ∈ Z × Z. Hence, once we proved the statement for both cases, it follows that the general statement is true. First, let a, b ∈ Z be arbitrary such that a ≡2 b. By definition of ρ2 we have a ρ2 b. Furthermore, it trivially holds b ρ2 b. This implies a ρ2 2 b and hence a ρ2 b since ρ2 ⊆ ρ. Now consider the case a ̸≡2 b. By definition of ≡2 there must exist k ∈ Z such that a − b = 2k + 1. Let c = b + 2(k + 1). Then we have c = a + 1, hence a ρ1 c and since ρ1 ⊆ ρ we get a ρ c. On the other hand, we have c ≡2 b, hence c ρ2 b and since ρ2 ⊆ ρ, this gives c ρ b. This implies a ρ2 b by the definition of composition of relations. 5.6 Lifting an Operation to Equivalence Classes a) We define the function sum : A2 → A by sum((a, b), (c, d)) def = (ad + bc, bd). Observe that bd ̸= 0 since b ̸= 0 and d ̸= 0. b) f is θ-consistent if and only if (b1 θ b ′ 1 and b2 θ b ′ 2) =⇒ f (b1, b2) θ f (b ′ 1, b ′ 2) is true for all b1, b2, b′ 1, b′ 2 ∈ B. Alternatively (and equivalently) we could say that f is θ-consistent if and only if ([b1]θ = [b ′ 1]θ and [b2]θ = [b ′ 2]θ) =⇒ [f (b1, b2)]θ = [f (b ′ 1, b ′ 2)]θ is true for all b1, b2, b′ 1, b′ 2 ∈ B. c) Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈ A be arbitrary. We have (a, b) ∼ (a ′, b ′) and (c, d) ∼ (c ′, d ′) · ⇐⇒ ab ′ = ba′ and cd ′ = dc ′ (def. ∼) · =⇒ ab′ · dd ′ + cd ′ · bb ′ = ba ′ · dd ′ + dc ′ · bb ′ · ⇐⇒ ad · b ′d ′ + bc · b ′d ′ = bd · a′d ′ + bd · b ′c ′ (comm.) · ⇐⇒ (ad + bc) · b ′d ′ = bd · (a′d ′ + b ′c ′) (distr.) · ⇐⇒ (ad + bc, bd) ∼ (a ′d ′ + b ′c ′, b ′d ′) (def. ∼) · ⇐⇒ sum((a, b), (c, d)) ∼ sum((a′, b ′), (c ′, d ′)). (def. sum) Hence, sum is ∼-consistent.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
