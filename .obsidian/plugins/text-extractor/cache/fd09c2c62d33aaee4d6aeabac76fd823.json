A vector v is just a list of m real numbers, v ∈ Rm, and can be interpreted as an m -dimensional point or an arrow from the origin to that point (motion). Vector Operations Vector Addition Let v, w ∈ Rm, v = [a1 … am], w = [b1 … bm], then v + w = [a1 + b1 … am + bm]. Basically, putting one arrow's base on the tip of the other and evaluating the result. Scalar Multiplication Let λ ∈ R. For some v = [a1 … am] ∈ Rm, then λv = [λa1 … λam]. Basically, stretching or squishing a vector by some real amount. Linear Combinations Combines scalar multiplication and vector addition Dot Product add sigma sum notation here in embed of wiki ﬁle Notation We can denote a set of vectors of order n {v1, v2, … , vn} = {vj|j ∈ [n]}, where [n] = {1, 2, … , n}. A single vector v ind m-dimensional space is denoted v = = [vi]m i=1. ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ v1 v2 ⋮ vm ⎤ ⎥ ⎦","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
