October 2023 Prof. Ueli Maurer Giovanni Deligios Diskrete Mathematik Exercise 6 Exercise 6.5 gives bonus points, which can increase the ﬁnal grade. The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 6.1 Partial Order Relations (⋆) a) Consider the poset (N \\ {0}; | ). Which of the following pairs are comparable? i) (11, 12) ii) (4, 6) iii) (5, 15) iv) (42, 42) b) Consider the set A := (N \\ {0}) × (N \\ {0}) with the lexicographic order ≤lex deﬁned by the divisibility relation |. Determine all elements a ∈ A, such that a ≤lex (2, 5). c) Prove or disprove: ({1, 3, 6, 9, 12}, | ) is a lattice. d) Prove or disprove: If (A; ≼) is a poset, then (A; ̂≼) is also a poset. 6.2 Hasse Diagrams (⋆) For each of the two posets: ({1, 2, 3}; ≤) and ({1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}; | ), draw the Hasse diagram and determine all least, greatest, minimal and maximal elements. 6.3 The Lexicographic Order (⋆ ⋆) Prove Theorem 3.13 from the lecture notes. 6.4 Inverses of Functions (⋆ ⋆) For a set A, the identity function id is deﬁned by id(a) = a for all a ∈ A. Consider a function f : A → A. Prove that there exists a function g : A → A such that g ◦ f = id if and only if f is injective. Such g is called a left inverse of f . 6.5 Countability and Uncountability (8 Points) Prove the following statements. a) (⋆) Let A, B be sets. If A is uncountable and A ≼ B then B is uncountable. b) (⋆) The set S = { functions {0, 1} → {0, 1}∞} is uncountable. 6.6 The Hunt for the Red October (⋆ ⋆) Svetlana is trying to sink a submarine called the Red October. The submarine moves with the constant speed v ∈ Z and, at a given time t ∈ N, it is located at the position v · t + s0, where s0 ∈ Z is the starting point. Svetlana does not know the values v and s0. At each point in time, she can ﬁre a torpedo to one position s ∈ Z. If at this moment the Red October can be found exactly at the position s, it sinks. Is there a strategy that allows Svetlana to sink the Red October in a ﬁnite time? 6.7 More Countability Determine whether the following sets are countable or uncountable. Prove your answers. a) (⋆) The set of all Java programs. b) (⋆) The set A of all semi-inﬁnite sequences over {0, 1, . . . , 9}. c) (⋆) The set C of all points on the unit circle, that is C := {(x, y) ∈ R2 | x2 + y2 = 1}. d) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) The set S = { f : N → {0, 1} \f \f ∀ n, m ∈ N : f (n) = 0 ∧ n | m → f (m) = 0 } . Hint: you can use the fact that there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers. Due on 2. November 2023. Exercise 6.5 is graded.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
