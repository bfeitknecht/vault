Al = { f : N → {0, 1}   ∀k ∈ N,   k ∑ i=0 f(i) ≤ k l + 1} Hint: For all l ≥ 1 explicitly write an injection from a known uncountable set into Al. Let A denote the set of all functions g : N → {0, 1}, which is uncountable per deﬁnition 3.23. To prove that Al is uncountable we will construct an injection into it. Let ψ : A → Al, denote the mapping g ↦ fg of a function in A to a function in Al, where we deﬁne fg as follows. fg(i) = { , ∀i ∈ N Now we show that such a function fg is in fact in Al. Then we must show that ψ is injective. Thus we have constructed an injective function from an uncountable set into Al and hence shown that it is uncountable. □ ∣ g(n) if ∃n ∈ N s.t.  i = n(l + 1) 0 else ∃n ∈ N,   (a) n(l + 1) ≤ k < (n + 1)(l + 1) ⋅ ⟹ k ∑ i=0 f(i) ≤ n + 1 (definition fg), (a) ⋅ ⟹ k ∑ i=0 f(i) ≤ k l + 1 (definition Al) ⋅ ⟹ fg ∈ Al    g1 ≠ g2 ⋅ ⟹ ∃n ∈ N,  g1(n) ≠ g2(n) (definition fg) ⋅ ⟹ fg1(n(l + 1)) ≠ fg2(n(l + 1)) (definition ψ) ⋅ ⟹ ψ(g1) ≠ ψ(g2) (definition injective) ⋅ ⟹ ψ injective","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
