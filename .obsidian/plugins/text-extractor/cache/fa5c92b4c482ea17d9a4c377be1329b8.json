The input for VC is a graph G = (V, E) and a natural number k. We transform every such input to an input for SCP. Let Ev := {e ∈ E | v is incident to e} be the set of edges incident to the vertex v and let SG = {Ev | v ∈ V }. Then (E, SG, k) is our input for SCP. Hence, for every vertex v, the set family SG contains the set of all edges incident to v. Note that two vertices v and w can have the same set Ev = Ew of incident edges; in this case Ev is contained in S only once. It is clear that the transformation can be computed in polynomial time. It remains to show that (G, k) is a yes-instance for VC if and only if (E, SG, k) is a yes-instance for SCP. Suppose that there exists a vertex cover of size k in G. Then there exists a set of k vertices {v1, v2, . . . , vk} that cover all edges in G. The covered edges can also be expressed as ⋃k i=1 Evi. Every set Evi is in SG. Hence, there exists a set cover of size at most k for (E, SG, k). Suppose that there exists a set cover of size k for (E, SG, k). Then there exists some C ⊆ SG such that |C| = k and ⋃S∈C S = E. Then the set of k vertices that are mapped to the sets in C by our reduction is incident to all edges in E. Hence, these vertices form a vertex cover of size k in G. If multiple vertices have the same set of incident edges and thus get mapped to the same set in C, then it clearly suffices to choose one such vertex for every such set in C. (b) Let (X, S, k) be an input for SCP such that X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, S = {S1, S2, . . . , Sm}, and k is a natural number. We transform every such input to an input (G, k) for DS, G = (V, E). The vertices of G are V = VX ∪· VS, where VX = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} and VS = {s1, s2, . . . , sm}, i.e., VX corresponds to the elements in X and VS corresponds to the sets in S. The edges in G between the vertices from VS form a clique. Moreover, the following equivalence holds: {xi, sj} ∈ E ⇐⇒ xi ∈ Sj , i. e., there exists an edge between a vertex in VX and a vertex in VS if and only if the element xi ∈ X is contained in the set Sj ∈ S, i. e., the element xi is covered by Sj. There are no edges between the vertices in VX. It is clear that the transformation can be computed in polynomial time. Now let (X, S, k) be an input for SCP such that X has a set cover from S of size k; let C be one such set cover. The corresponding vertices in VS are a dominating set D of the same size. This can be justified as follows. All vertices in VS are trivially dominated because VS is a clique. Moreover, every vertex in VX is adjacent to a vertex in D because every element in X is contained in at least one set in C. On the other hand, let D be a dominating set of size k in G. If D ⊆ VS, then the corresponding sets in S are a set cover of X of the same size. This can be justified as before. If there is a vertex x ∈ D \\ VS, then we can modify D by replacing x by an adjacent vertex in VS. The two vertices are still dominated and no other vertex in VX looses x as its dominating vertex because the vertices VX form an independent set (there is no edge within VX) while the vertices in VS are certainly dominated (because VS is a clique). Solution to Task 29 We consider the reduction from the task statement and show that the formula Φ is satisfiable if and only if there exists a subset U ⊆ S such that ∑ x∈U x = t. Let α be a satisfying assignment for Φ. We use it to construct a subset Uα as follows: For every variable xi with α(xi) = 1, we choose ri ∈ Uα, for every variable xi with α(xi) = 0, we choose r′ i ∈ Uα. For every clause Cj in which α satisfies all three literals, we also include sj in Uα. Analogously, we include s′ j in Uα if α satisfies exactly two literals in Cj, and we include both sj and s′ j in Uα if α satisfies exactly one literal in Cj. It remains to show that ∑x∈Uα x = t holds for the set Uα that we just defined. We first observe that no carry can ever emerge during addition. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the i-th digit is only equal to 1 in the two numbers ri and r′ i while it is equal to 0 in all other numbers. For all 1 ≤ j ≤ k, the (n + j)-th digit is only nonzero in at most five numbers, namely it is equal to 1 in at most three numbers ri or r′ i, where xi occurs positively or negatively in Cj, and it is equal to 1 and 2 in the two numbers sj and s′ j. Consequently, the (n + j)-th digit of the sum can never exceed 6. Hence, the individual digits can be considered separately in the proof. We first analyze the i-th digit, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Because α assigns xi either with α(xi) = 0 or α(xi) = 1, exactly one of the two numbers ri and r′ i is included in Uα. Because the i-th digit is equal to 0 in all other numbers, the i-th digit of the sum is equal to t[i] = 1. If α satisfies exactly l literals in the clause Cj, for some l ∈ {1, 2, 3}, then the corresponding numbers ri and r′ i for these literals contribute l to the (n + j)-th digit of the sum. Adding the numbers sj and s′ j according to the above rule yields the sum equal to t[n + j] = 4. Hence, Uα satisfies the condition that ∑ x∈Uα x = t. In the other direction, let us assume that U is a subset of S such that ∑ x∈Uα x = t. We use it to construct an assignment αU for Φ as follows: If ri ∈ U , then we set αU (xi) = 1, if r′ i ∈ U , then we set αU (xi) = 0. For every i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, exactly one of these cases must occur because of t[i] = 1. Hence, αU is well-defined. Now we show that αU satisfies the formula Φ. Because t[n + j] = 4, but the (n + j)-th digits of the numbers sj and s′ j add up to at most 3, for every 1 ≤ j ≤ k, one of the numbers ri or r′ i with ri[n + j] = 1 or r′ i[n + j] = 1 must be included in U . If this number is ri, then αU (xi) = 1 was set. By construction, the variable xi occurs positively in Cj (because ri[n + j] = 1) and thus the clause Cj is satisfied by αU . If the number r′ i with r′ i[n + j] = 1 is included in U , then αU (xi) = 0 was set. By construction, the variable xi occurs negatively in Cj (because r′ i[n + j] = 1) and thus the clause Cj is again satisfied by αU . Hence, αU is a satisfying assignment for Φ.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
