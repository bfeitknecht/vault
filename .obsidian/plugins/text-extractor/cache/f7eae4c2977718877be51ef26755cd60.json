Only one member from each group should submit the report. All members of the group will get the same grade. The name of the submitted file should be Lab1_LastName1_LastName2.zip (or .tar), where LastName1 and LastName2 are the last names of the members of the group. Note 1: Please include all the required material. No links/shortcuts are accepted. Note 2: The deadline for the report is a hard deadline and it will not be extended. Exercise 1. Designing a Testbench for the FSM of Lab 4 In the manual, you learned how to design a testbench for a combinational circuit (the ALU). In this exercise, you will design a simple testbench for the FSM from Lab 4. You need to use the testbench to pass the inputs to the unit under test (UUT) — in this case, your FSM — and observe and verify the state transitions (current state and next state) in the waveforms. You do not need to specify the golden model result and compare it with your FSM output through the testbench. Note: Enable and disable the reset signal during the initialization phase. You also need to pass the clock signal to the FSM module. In your submission, include: • Your testbench Verilog code; • Your FSM codes from Lab 4; • Your input file; • A print-screen of your state transitions in the waveforms for the case when you set the right signal equal to logic-1.
