{"path":"var/export/LinAlg-bf-u06.pdf","text":"2 From the previous exercise we know the following. 1a hyperplane H is a subspace of V 1b dimension of hyperplane H is dim(V )− 1 Furthermore, we can visualize a given matrix A ∈ R2×m as illustrated below. A = [ ] Then the set condition Av = 0 in S v can be rewritten as [u⊤ i v]2 i=1 = 0, where v ∈ Rm denotes an arbitrary ﬁxed, non-zero vector, i.e. v ≠ 0. This implies that both row vectors of A, namely u1, u2 ∈ Rm must be orthogonal to v, i.e. lie in the hyperplane H = {w ∈ Rm : w⊤v = 0}⊆ Rm induced by it. P er 1a, 1b we know that the dimension of a hyperplane that is vector subspace of a vector space V is dim(V )− 1. S ince dim(Rm)= m, we have dim(H)= m − 1. Hence, any two row vectors u1, u2 ∈ H form a basis for A such that Av = 0. Then, the dimension of S v is the number of row vectors in A times the dimension of their vector space. Thus, dim(S v)= 2(m − 1). □  — u1 —   — u2 —","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
