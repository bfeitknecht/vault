(Baseline: serialization of the parallel algorithm). Sometimes there is a better serial algorithm that does not parallelize well. In these cases it is fairer to use that algorithm for T1 (absolute speedup). Using an unnecessarily poor baseline artificially inflates speedup and efficiency. 15 (parallel) speedup graph example 16 why Sp < p? ● Programs may not contain enough parallelism – e.g., some parts of program might be sequential ● overheads introduced by parallelization – typically associated with synchronization ● architectural limitations – e.g., memory contention 17 Question: Parallel program: – sequential part: 20% – parallel part: 80% (assume it scales linearly) – T1 = 10 What is T8 ? What is the speedup S8 ? Sequential part Parallel part 18 Answer: ● 𝑇! = 10 ● 𝑇\" = 3 ● 𝑆\" = 𝑇!/𝑇\" = 10/3 = 3.33 Sequential part Parallel part 80% 20% 21 Amdahl’s Law 22 …the effort expended on achieving high parallel processing rates is wasted unless it is accompanied by achievements in sequential processing rates of very nearly the same magnitude. — Gene Amdahl Amdahl’s Law – Ingredients Execution time T1 of a program falls into two categories: • Time spent doing non-parallelizable serial work • Time spent doing parallelizable work Call these 𝑊#$% and 𝑊𝑝𝑎𝑟 respectively 23 Amdahl’s Law – Ingredients Given 𝑃 workers available to do parallelizable work, the times for sequential execution and parallel execution are: 𝑇! = 𝑊#$% + 𝑊&'% And this gives a bound on speed-up: 𝑇& ≥ 𝑊#$% + 𝑊&'% 𝑃 24 Amdahl’s Law Plugging these relations into the definition of speedup yields Amdahl's Law: 𝑆& ≤ 𝑊#$% + 𝑊&'% 𝑊#$% + 𝑊&'% 𝑃 25 Amdahl’s Law - Corollary If f is the non-parallelizable serial fractions of the total work, then the following equalities hold: 𝑊#$% = 𝒇𝑇!, 𝑊&'% = 1 − 𝒇 𝑇! which gives: 𝑆& ≤ 1 𝒇 + 1 − 𝒇 𝑃 26 𝑆! ≤ 𝑊\"#$ + 𝑊!%$ 𝑊\"#$ + 𝑊!%$ 𝑃What happens if we have infinite workers?
