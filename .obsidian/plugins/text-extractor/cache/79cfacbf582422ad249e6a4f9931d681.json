Now, we will formulate the inductive hypothesis, for some arbitrary n ∈ N In the inductive step, we let n ← n + 1, i.e. All that remains is to simplify and apply the inductive hypothesis. 1 n ∑ k=0(2k + 1) ≤ 1 (n + 1)2 1 = 1       n ∑ k=0(2k + 1) ≥ (n + 1)2, ∀n ≥ 0 n+1 ∑ k=0(2k + 1) ≥ (n + 2)2 n+1 ∑ k=0(2k + 1) ≥ (n + 2)2 (split the sum, expand the square) ( n ∑ k=0(2k + 1)) + (2n + 3) ≥ n2 + 4n + 4 (subtract like terms) n ∑ k=0(2k + 1) ≥ n2 + 2n + 1 (collect the square) n ∑ k=0(2k + 1) i.h. ≥ (n + 1)2 □ (b) We determine m through computing the ﬁrst few terms. This yields m = 4. We use this computation as base case for our induction. and formulate the inductive hypothesis for some m ≤ n ∈ N.

Since the limit as m approaches inﬁnity equals zero, f grows asymptotically slower than g. □ lim m→∞ 10m5 + 90m4 100m5 = (10m + 1) (100m) l’Hôpital = 10 100 = 0.1 m4 m4 lim m→∞ 80 log(m) − 1 5 log(m)2 l’Hôpital = 80 m 10 log(m) m = 8 log(m) ∞ → 0 (c) We make use of the fact that log(m3) = 3 log m and further reduce the fraction in the limit 3 log(m) = 3 log(m)3 . Since the limit of a constant divided by a monotonically increasing function is zero, f indeed grows asymptotically slower than g. □ (d) This proves, that f does in fact grow asymptotically slower than g. □ log(m) 3 2 lim m→∞ 4m2+m+1 23m2 = lim m→∞ 2 +2m+2 2 m2 = lim m→∞ 2 = 0 2m2 3 2m+2−m2 −∞","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
