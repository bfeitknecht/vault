In the literature, one often finds a weaker version of the pumping lemma which does not consider all words w ∈ Σ∗ with |w| ≥ n0, but only the words w ∈ L with |w| ≥ n0, and where, accordingly, condition (iii) is replaced by (iii’) {yx kz | k ∈ N} ⊆ L. We consider the language L = {ambncn | m, n ∈ N} ∪ {b, c} ∗. (a) Show that L is not regular. (b) Show that L still satisfies the weakened pumping lemma described above. Note: There also exist non-regular languages that even satisfy the stronger version of the pumping lemma seen in the lecture. Hence, the nonregularity of these languages cannot be proven by directly using the pumping lemma.) 10 points Task 17 Prove the following statement by providing an explicit automaton construction. Argue informally about the correctness of this construction. Let L1 and L2 be two regular languages over the alphabet Σ = {a, b}. Then the language L = L1 · {c} · L2 over the alphabet {a, b, c} is also regular. 10 points Task 18 (a) The chocolatier and the taster are playing an infinite game. The game consists of countably infinitely many rounds. In the first round, the chocolatier serves the taster a finite, arbitrarily large number of chocolates, and the taster may choose exactly one of these chocolates to eat. In each subsequent round, the chocolatier adds a finite, arbitrarily large number of fresh chocolates to the ones already served, and the taster may again eat exactly one chocolate – either a freshly added one or one that has been served in a previous round but hasn’t been eaten yet. The taster wishes to eat every chocolate that is served to her during the game. What strategy allows her to achieve this? Why does this strategy work? (b) The chocolatier and the taster play again, but now the chocolatier serves countably infinitely many additional chocolates in each round. How can the taster still manage to eat every chocolate served to her? Why does this strategy work? Note: If you are scared of infinite games, imagine that the n-th round of the game is played in 1 2n minutes. Hence the entire game only takes ∑∞ n=1 1 2n minutes = 1 minute to play. 10 points Submission: On Friday, November 1, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
