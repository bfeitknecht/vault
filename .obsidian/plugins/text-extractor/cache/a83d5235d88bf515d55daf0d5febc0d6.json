Namely I states, that for arbitrary n, m ∈ N, if n divides m and m + 1, then n must be equal to one. For the sake of contradiction, let's assume I is false, i.e. ¬(S → T ) ≡ S ∧ ¬T . In words this equates to the assumption, that n divides m and m + 1, for some arbitrary n, m ∈ N but n ≠ 1. Hence we have arrived at a contradiction, since we assumed n ≠ 1, and the statement I is proven. □ S ⋅ ⟺ (n ∣ m) ∧ (n ∣ m + 1) (definition of divides) ⋅ ⟺ ∃k, l(k ⋅ n = m ∧ l ⋅ n = m + 1) (substitute m) ⋅ ⟹ ∃k, l(l ⋅ n = (k ⋅ n) + 1) (rearrange) ⋅ ⟺ ∃k, l((l ⋅ n) − (k ⋅ n) = 1) (rearrange) ⋅ ⟺ ∃k, l((l − k) ⋅ n = 1) (definition of divides) ⋅ ⟺ n ∣ 1 (3.2 iii.) ⋅ ⟹ n ↯ = 1 (contradiction!)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
