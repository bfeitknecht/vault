Based on many years of research, it is known that the lead concentration X in a soil sample is approximately normally distributed. It is also known that the expected value is 32 ppb (parts per billion) and that the standard deviation is 6 ppb. (The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance, i.e. sd(X) := √ Var[X].) (a) Sketch the density of X and indicate in the sketch the probability that a soil sample contains between 26 and 38 ppb of lead. (b) What is the probability that a soil sample contains at most 40 ppb of lead? Hint: Standardize the random variable and use the table of the standard normal distribution below. (c) What is the probability that a soil sample contains at most 27 ppb of lead? (d) What lead concentration is not exceeded with 97.5% probability? That is, find the value c such that the probability that the lead concentration is less than or equal to c is exactly 97.5%. (e) What lead concentration is not exceeded with 10% probability? (f) What is the value of the probability indicated in part (a)? Exercise 8.7. The joint density f (x, y) of two continuous random variables X and Y is constant on the square Q (see sketch) and zero outside of Q. 3 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Q 1-1 1 -1 y x . (a) Determine the joint density of (X, Y ). (b) Determine the marginal densities fX and fY of the random variables X and Y . (c) Are X and Y independent? (d) What is the answer to (c) if the square Q is rotated by 45 degrees? Exercise 8.8. For two independent random variables X and Y , it is known from the lecture that Cov(X, Y ) = 0, i.e., the random variables are uncorrelated. In this problem, we show that the converse is not true in general. (a) Let X ∼ U([−π, π]). Show that Y := cos(X) and Z := sin(X) are uncorrelated, i.e., Cov(Y, Z) = 0. (b) Show that Y and Z are not independent. Hint: If Y and Z were independent, then Y 2 and Z 2 would also be independent. Disprove the latter by considering P[Y 2 ≤ 1/2, Z 2 ≤ 1/2]. Exercise 8.9. Let X and Y be two random variables that can only take the values 0 and 1. The joint distribution of (X, Y ) satisfies: P[X = 0] = 1 2 , P[Y = 0] = 1 3 , and P[X = 0, Y = 0] = p. (a) What values can p take, and for which values of p are X and Y independent? (b) Compute the expectations E[X], E[Y ], and E[XY ], as well as the variances Var[X] and Var[Y ], as functions of p. When does E[XY ] = E[X]E[Y ] hold? (c) Give an example of random variables U and V such that E[U V ] = E[U ]E[V ], but U and V are not independent. 4 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Quantile table for the standard normal distribution 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.95 0.975 0.99 0.995 0.999 0 0.6745 1.2816 1.6449 1.9600 2.3263 2.5758 3.0902 .
