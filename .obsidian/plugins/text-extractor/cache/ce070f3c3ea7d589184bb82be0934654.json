Additionally, T is a compound statement from S and the the binding of its n = 1. □ 1.4 (a) We deﬁ ne the formula F ≡ (B → C) → (¬(A → C) ∧ ¬(A ∨ B)). Now we will simplify F through a series of equivalence transformations. We arrive at the conclusion that F ≡ A ∨ B, since we can freely rename the variables now that there exists no conﬂ icts. The function table for F is □ (b) We use the formula derived from subpart (a), namely G ≡ A ∨ B. □ 1.5 F ≡ (B → C) → (¬(A → C) ∧ ¬(A ∨ B)) (def. →) ≡ (B → C) → (¬(¬A ∨ B) ∧ ¬(A ∨ B)) (de Morgan) ≡ (B → C) → ¬((¬A ∨ B) ∨ (A ∨ B)) (associativity of ∨) ≡ (B → C) → ¬(¬A ∨ B ∨ A ∨ B) (idempotence) ≡ (B → C) → ¬(¬A ∨ A ∨ B) (tautology) ≡ (B → C) → ¬(⊤ ∨ B) (dito) ≡ (B → C) → ¬⊤ (unsatisfiability) ≡ ¬(B → C) ∨ ⊥ (def. →) ≡ ¬¬(B ∨ C) ∨ ⊥ (dito) ≡ (B ∨ C) ∨ ⊥ (double negation) ≡ B ∨ C (unsatisfiability) A B F 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 a) i) Let us ﬁ rst cover the ♡ operator. Since the function tables for A♡B and B ♡A are not the same, A♡B ≢ B ♡A, i.e. the ♡ operator is not commutative. □ ii) Now, we cover the ♢ operator. Since the function tables for A♢B and B ♢A are the same, A♢B ≡ B ♢A, i.e. the ♢ operator is commutative. □ b) A B A♡B B ♡A 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 A B A♢B B ♢A 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 Let's deﬁ ne the left-hand-side formula as F ≡ (¬A♡B)♢(B ♡C) and the right- hand-side formula as G ≡ ¬(A♢B)♡¬(A♢C). To make our life easier, we decompose the logical formulae into their components. First, let's cover F . Then, we will go over F as a whole. Now that we have that, we need to look at G. Then, we'll go over it as a whole.
