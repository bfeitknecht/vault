Consider as counterexample Z4. Let a = 0 and b = 2. Then, for m = 2, n = 3 we have gcd(n, m) = 1 and am ≡ 4 bm as well as an ≡ 4 bn. However a ≠ b. This only works in an integral domain, where there are no zero divisors. □ b) Let y = 1 − ab be a unit in R with its multiplicative inverse x = (1 − ab) −1. Thus it holds that (1 − ab)x = x(1 − ab) = 1. Then we denote y′ = 1 − ba. The following statement is to prove. y ∈ R∗ ⟹ y′ ∈ R∗ Consider the element x′ = 1 + bxa ∈ R. We demonstrate that y′x′ = x′y′ = 1. First, let's consider y′x′. S imilarly, we cover the case x′y′ below. Thus, we have shown that (1 − ba)x′ = x′(1 − ba) = 1, where x′ is the multiplicative inverse of y′ = 1 − ba. Hence, y′ ∈ R∗ is a unit, as was to be proven. □ y′x′ = (1 − ba)(1 + bxa) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 + bxa − ba − babxa (distributivity, associativity) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 − ba + bxa − babxa (left distributivity) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 − ba + b(xa − abxa) (right distributivity) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 − ba + b(x − abx)a (dito) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 − ba + b((1 − ab)x)a (multiplicative inverse) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 − ba + ba (additive inverse) ⟺ y′x′ = 1 x′y′ = (1 + bxa)(1 − ba) ⟺ x′y′ = 1 − ba + bxa − bxaba (distributivity, right distributivity) ⟺ x′y′ = 1 − ba + (bx − bxab)a (left distributivity) ⟺ x′y′ = 1 − ba + b(x − xab)a (dito) ⟺ x′y′ = 1 − ba + b(x(1 − ab))a (multiplicative inverse) ⟺ x′y′ = 1 − ba + ba (additive inverse) ⟺ x′y′ = 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
