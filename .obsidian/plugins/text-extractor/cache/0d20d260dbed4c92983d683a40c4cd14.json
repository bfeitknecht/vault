With virtual sensing, each station keeps a logical record of when the channel is in use by tracking the NAV (Network Allocation Vector). Each frame carries a NAV field that specifies how long the sequence to which the frame belongs will take to complete. Note: The lecture states that nodes only wait after receiving a CTS. Node C reserved a NAV upon receiving a RTS which is the effect of an optimization in the implementation: Upon receiving an RTS the node waits for a potential following CTS finally reserving the whole transmission time if a CTS is received. In practice there are many more optimizations like this. Question 1.1 Can you say something about the distance of the stations from A? Is station C or D closer? Briefly explain. Solution: Station C is the closest to A since it heard the RTS and responded to it by asserting its NAV signal. D did not respond, so it must be outside A’s radio range. Question 1.2 Assume there are 4 wireless stations in a straight line, A through D, communi- cating using the Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA) protocol, as 1 shown below. Every station is only in the range of its neighbors and vice versa. Stations A-D in a straight line • Is it possible for two transmissions to take place simultaneously? Briefly explain. • What is the minimum number of stations in this scenario for two transmis- sions to take place simultaneously? Solution: • Yes. See the images below taken from the “Link Layer-Protocols” lecture. B sends to A and C sends to D. Note that A+C or B+D as receivers would not work. Exchanging the RTS. All nodes receive an RTS 2 Exchanging the CTS. Senders B & C did not observe an CTS for the RTS from before. Therefore they will not reach the receiver of the other transmission and can send without disrupting this transmission. Note that the sender of the other connection does not bother to receive a link while sending. Transmitting the Frames • The minimum is 4. Since no node can send and receive at the same time there must be at least 4 nodes for 2 transmissions Question 1.3 Now assume CSMA/CD (not CSMA/CA) for a wired network. If signal prop- agation speed in twin lead is 2.46 · 108 m/s and signal propagation speed in multimode fiber is 1.95 · 108 m/s, a) What is the minimum time a node must transmit such that to be sure that no other node started transmission without sensing its message for a 2 km twin-lead cable? b) What is the minimum time a node must transmit such that to be sure that no other node started transmission without sensing its message for a 40 km multimode fiber optic cable? Solution: For your convenience a small reminder about CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA: 3 CSMA/CD CSMA/CA used in wired networks mostly used in wireless networks focus at recovering fast from collisions (e.g. with jams) focus at preventing collisions (RTS/CTS) In CSMA/CD a node does not transmit if it senses a transmission. After transmitting for RTT of the shared medium without collisions the node can be sure that no other node started transmitting at roughly the same time. Here we refer to this time as the “contention slot” a) Signal propagation speed in twin lead is 2.46 · 10 8 m/s. Signal propagation time for 2 km is 8.13 µs. So, the length of contention slot is 16.26 µs. b) Signal propagation speed in multimode fiber is 1.95 · 108 m/s. Signal propagation time for 40 km is 205.13 µs. So, the length of contention slot is 410.26 µs. Question 2: Wireless The following topology consists of 6 wireless nodes, A through F, illustrated by the corresponding dots: Figure 2: Network topology The circle around each node illustrates its transmission range. For example, A’s transmission area is shown by the shaded circle, and it cannot reach F. The 4 transmissions of two nodes interfere if and only if they transmit at the same time and their transmission areas overlap. Question 2.1 For the transmission from A to B, list the potential hidden terminals from A and the exposed terminals. Solution: • Hidden terminals: C, F • Exposed terminal: E Question 2.2 Assume you are using an RTS/CTS protocol to reduce the hidden/exposed terminal problems. a) Explain what prevents a hidden terminal from interfering with a sender. b) Explain how a terminal infers that it is exposed and can thus send to another destination. c) An exposed terminal in an RTS/CTS protocol may still be unsuccessful in sending. Explain how this is possible. Solution: a) Although the hidden terminal does not see the RTS of the sender, it sees the CTS of the receiver and infers that it should not transmit at the same time. b) The exposed terminal sees the RTS of the sender, but not the CTS of the receiver, thus it knows it can send. c) Another simultaneous transmission may interfere with the receipt of a CTS or ACK. In other words, a frame sent between another pair of nodes may collide with a control frame that the transmitter is supposed to receive. This is why the RTS/CTS mechanism alone does not completely solve the exposed terminal problem. 5","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
