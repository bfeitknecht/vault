Formulas (a) Solution 1. ∀x. p(x) ∧ q(y) and ∀y. p(y) ∧ q(x) In the first formula x is bound and y is free, while in the second formula y is bound and x is free. As we have q(y) in the first and q(x) in the second formula with both variables free, the formulas are not α-equivalent. 2. ∀x. ∀y. p(x, y) ∧ p(x, z) ∧ ∃z. p(x, z) and ∀y. ∀x. p(y, x) ∧ p(y, z) ∧ ∃z. p(y, z) These two formulas are α-equivalent, as can be seen by the formula ∀u. ∀v. p(u, v) ∧ p(u, z) ∧ ∃w. p(u, w), which is renamed away from both given formulas. (b) Solution Substituting the free variable x by f (y) results in the formula p(y) ∧ p(f (y)) ∧ (∀z. q(f (y), z)) ∧ ∃w. p(w). Take care not to capture the bound y in the formula (α-converted to z), or to substitute the last x as it is bound separately (α-converted to w for clarity). 2. Structures Solution. Note that there are several correct answers for each subtask. (a) ϕ1 = (∃x. p(x)) ∧ (∃y. q(y)) → (∃x. p(x) ∧ q(x)) Here is a structure A1 = (UA1, IA1) that satisfies the formula, i.e., A1 |= ϕ1. UA1 = {a, b, c} IA1(p) = {a, b} IA1(q) = {a, c} Here is a structure A ′ 1 = (UA′ 1, IA′ 1) that does not satisfy the formula, i.e., A ′ 1 ̸|= ϕ1.
