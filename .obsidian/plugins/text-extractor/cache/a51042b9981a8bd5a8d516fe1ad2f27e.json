The solution to these exercises must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM24/. 7.1 The Greatest Common Divisor (⋆) If d = gcd(a, b) then one can write d as a linear combination of a and b (Corollary 4.5). In this exercise we show that when d = 1 the converse is also true. More formally, prove that for all a, b, u, v ∈ Z \\ {0} such that ua + vb = 1, we have gcd(a, b) = 1. 7.2 Geometric Interpretation of the Greatest Common Divisor (⋆ ⋆) Let a, b ∈ N. In the cartesian plane, consider the segment with endpoints (0, 0) and (a, b). Show that the number of points with integer coordinates on this segment is gcd(a, b) + 1. 7.3 Properties of Greatest Common Divisors and Least Common Multiples (⋆) (8 Points) Prove or disprove the following properties. Only use the definitions of ideals, gcd and lcm, and don’t use the the results from Section 4.3.3 in the lecture. a) For all positive integers a, b (a) ∪ (b) = (gcd(a, b)). b) For all positive integers a, b (a) ∩ (b) = (lcm(a, b)). 7.4 Congruences a) (⋆) Prove that for all m, n ∈ N, if m ≡4 n, then 123m ≡10 33n. b) (⋆) Prove that for all a, b, c, d, m ∈ Z such that m > 0, if a ≡m b and c ≡m d, then ac ≡m bd. c) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Prove that there do not exist m, n ∈ Z, such that n5 + 7 = m2. 7.5 Modular Arithmetic (⋆) a) Prove that 7 | (13n + 6) for every even integer n ≥ 0. b) Prove that for any a, e, m, n ∈ N \\ {0}, if Rm(ae) = 1, then Rm(an) = Rm(aRe(n)). c) Using the above fact and the fact that R13(212) = 1, compute R13(22023). 7.6 Multiplicative Inverses a) (⋆) Let a, m ∈ N with m > 0. Show how given any u and v such that ua + vm = 1, one can compute the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. b) (⋆ ⋆) Compute the multiplicative inverse of 142 modulo 553. Hint: Use Lemma 4.2 to find gcd(142, 553), and, at the same time, u and v, such that gcd(142, 553) = 142u + 553v. 7.7 Solution of a Congruence Equation (⋆ ⋆) Prove that for all a, b, m ∈ Z such that m > 0, the equation ax ≡m b has a solution x ∈ Z if and only if gcd(a, m) | b. 7.8 The Chinese Remainder Theorem (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) a) Show that for all a, b ∈ Z and n, m ∈ N \\ {0} such that gcd(n, m) = 1 we have a ≡nm b ⇐⇒ a ≡n b ∧ a ≡m b b) Let a, b, c be pairwise relatively prime integers. For n = ab, m = ac and integers y1, y2 such that 0 ≤ y1 < n and 0 ≤ y2 < m, consider the following system of congruence equations: x ≡n y1 x ≡m y2 How many solutions 0 ≤ x < nm does the above system of equations have, depend- ing on a, b, c and y1, y2?
