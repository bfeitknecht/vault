A Recursion ® Obey the rules of recursion Where: Subtasks have the same shape 1. Base cases must be correct Why: To simplify a problem with induction 2. Recursive calls shrink to a base case How: Use induction!!! 3. Assume recursive calls are correct I Do not think more than 1 recurrence down ET EK e Build bases cases from the calls No prints or simulation, just read it aloud! o Name the function on it’s promises! o Avoid simulating/visualizing, it’s painful Consider this: o Recursion is naturally inductive You are one of two types of people: you can read o Read aloud and see if it makes sense recurrence relations or you are one of two types of people","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"deu+eng"}
