Show that Lall is not recursive by applying Rice’s Theorem. 10 points Task 24 Let M be a 1-tape Turing machine that always halts. Prove that there exists an equivalent 2-tape Turing machine A such that, for some constant c and for all n: TimeA(n) ≤ TimeM (n) 2 + 13n 12 + c. Hint: The 2-tape TM A can simulate 12 cells of the input or working tape of M in a single cell. 10 points Submission: On Friday, November 22, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
