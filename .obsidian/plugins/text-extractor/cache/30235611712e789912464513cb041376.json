Let's deﬁne the invariant that denotes for any non-leaf node in the tree Tk, the absolute diﬀerence between its left and right subtrees' heights is exactly equal to one as follows. I(k) = ∀u ∈ Tk, degout(u) ≠ 0 : |hl(u) − hr(u)| = 1 We use the fact from (c) that ∀k ∈ N : height(Tk) = k and prove I(k) by induction on k. Base C ase k ≤ 3 For k = 1 we have only one node, namely the root, which is a leaf. Hence I(1) holds trivially. For k = 2, we have the root node which is not a leaf. It's left subtree consists of a single leaf, whereas its right subtree doesn't exist and thus has height zero. Then |1 − 0| = 1 and I(2) holds. For k = 3 there are two non-leaf nodes to consider. Per deﬁnition of ﬁbonacci trees, the invariant holds for the subtree rooted at the left child of the root in T3, since it's identical to T2, which we've just covered before. Then for the root, we consider the absolute diﬀerence of its left and right subtrees' heights, which is |2 − 1| = 1 so the invariant also holds. Thus I(3) holds. Induction H ypothesis k = h We assume that ∃h ∈ N such that I(h) holds for Th. Induction Step k = h + 1 We now show that I(h + 1) holds. Per deﬁnition, the root vr of the tree Th+1 has as left subtree Th and right subtree T ′ h− 1, a modiﬁcation of Th− 1 that adds Fib(h + 2) to every node. It's noted that this does not aﬀect the height of the tree. Then we have |hl(vr) − hr(vr)| = |h − (h − 1)| = 1, so the root node fulﬁlls the invariant. Then the induction hypothesis that we assume to be true, guarantees that the root's left and right subtrees fulﬁll the invariants I(k) and I(k − 1) respectively. Per deﬁnition of ﬁbonacci trees, I(h) ⟹ I(h − 1) which covers all other non- leaf nodes. Hence, the invariant I(h + 1) holds and the statement is proven. □ (f) probably something with the last tree.. 6.3 (a) (b) probably 2n (c) (d) f\u0000n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000n A(n)     \u0000\u0000 n <= 2 t\u0000en retur\u0000 n     \u0000l\u0000e         \u0000\u0000 n % 2 \u0000\u0000 1 t\u0000en             retur\u0000 (A(n-1) + A(n-2)) / 2         \u0000l\u0000e             retur\u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000\u00001/A(n-2)) + (1/A(n-3)))         end     end end 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.4 (a) (b) (c)","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
