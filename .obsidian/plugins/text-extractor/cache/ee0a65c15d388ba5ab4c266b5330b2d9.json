It follows that Avn = vn+1 for A = [ ]. Since A is full rank, it has a complete set of real eigenvectors. Thus it's possible to diagonalize it, A = UΛU −1, where Λ = [ ] is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and U = [ ] contains the corresponding eigenvectors. First, ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A through examination of the characteristic polynomial. Then, let's derive the associated eigenvectors. Finally, we conclude that vn = Anv0 = UΛnU −1v0. This can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, vn = c1u1λn 1 + c2u2λn 2 . Through substitution of the previously computed values, this simpliﬁes to the following, from which we can derive the values c1, c2. Since an = [ ]vn, we have shown that for α = λ1 = 2 and β = λ2 = −3 it holds that an = 4 5 αn + 1 5 βn. □ an+1 an −1 6 1 0 λ1 0 0 λ2 u1 u2 det([ ]) det(A − λI) = λ2 + λ − 6 = (λ + 3)(λ − 2) ⟹ λ1 = 2, λ2 = −3 −1−λ 6 1 −λ    (A − λ1I)u1 = 0 ⟹ [ ] ([ ] − [ ]) [ ] = [ ] ⟹ − 3u11 + 6u12 = 0 ⟹ u11 = 2u12 ⟹ u1 = [ ] (A − λ2I)u2 = 0 ⟹ [ ] ([ ] − [ ]) [ ] = [ ] ⟹ 2u21 + 6u22 = 0 ⟹ u21 = −3u22 ⟹ u2 = [ ] −3 6 1 −2    −1 6 1 0 2 0 0 2 u11 u12 0 0 2 1 2 6 1 3    −1 6 1 0 −3 0 0 −3 u21 u22 0 0 −3 1 vn = [ ] (n = 0) ⟹ v0 = [ ] = [ ] ⟹ c1 = 1 5 , c2 = 4 5 2c12n − 3c2(−3) n c12n + c2(−3)n 1 1 2c1 − 3c2 c1 + c2 0 1","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
