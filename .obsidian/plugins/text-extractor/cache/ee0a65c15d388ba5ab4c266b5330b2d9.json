It follows that Avn = vn+1 for A = [ ]. Since A is full rank, it has a complete set of real eigenvectors. Thus it's possible to diagonalize the matrix A = V ΛV −1, where Λ = [ ] is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and V = [ ] contains the corresponding eigenvectors. First, ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A through examination of the characteristic polynomial. Then, let's derive the associated eigenvectors. Finally, we conclude that vn = Anv0 = V ΛnV −1v0. Thus it follows that α = λ1 = 2 and β = λ2 = −3. □ an+1 an −1 6 1 0 λ1 0 0 λ2 v1 v2 det([ ]) det(A − λI) = λ2 + λ − 6 = (λ + 3)(λ − 2) ⟹ λ1 = 2, λ2 = −3 −1−λ 6 1 −λ    (A − λ1I)v1 = 0 ⟹ [ ] ([ ] − [ ]) [ ] = [ ] ⟹ − 3v1 + 6v2 = 0 ⟹ v1 = 2v2 ⟹ v1 = [ ] (A − λ2I)v2 = 0 ⟹ [ ] ([ ] − [ ]) [ ] = [ ] ⟹ 2v1 + 6v2 = 0 ⟹ v1 = −3v2 ⟹ v2 = [ ] −3 6 1 −2    −1 6 1 0 2 0 0 2 v1 v2 0 0 2 1 2 6 1 3    −1 6 1 0 −3 0 0 −3 v1 v2 0 0 −3 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
