I understand that you mentioned it in the lecture, but I had to leave halfway every week due to clashing timetables and therefore did not come to know about this. I already had a semester project at that point and would have rather stayed home and taken care of other tasks How to attend to VLSI lectures ▪ VLSI lecture series can be followed in any order ▪ VLSI 1/3 as well as VLSI 2/4 can be visited in parallel ▪ VLSI 2/4 are more specialized than VLSI 1/3 ▪ You do not have to take all lectures ▪ You can tune your attendance according to your interest ▪ IC Design based semester/master theses available ONLY with VLSI2 ▪ It is possible to design your own IC at ETHZ during your studies ▪ This requires you to attend VLSI2 at some point VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Warning to non D-ITET students ▪ We expect you to know the basics of Digital Circuits ▪ Boolean logic ▪ Basic logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR..) ▪ Binary numbers ▪ Sequential logic elements: Flip-flops, latches ▪ Propagation and Contamination delay ▪ Setup and Hold time ▪ Finite State Machines (FSMs) ▪ Your textbook has an appendix for the basic knowledge ▪ Make sure you have these topics covered ▪ Do not be upset if exam questions assume you know these VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs About teaching style ▪ We are back to normal teaching ▪ All lectures/exercises in presence ▪ There will be no recordings, live streams ▪ This semester lectures will be shared with Kyiv School of Economics in Ukraine electronically ▪ If you have conflicts with the lecture/exercise time -> drop VLSI1 or the other one ▪ Moodle has now a feature to have anoynmous questions ▪ .. also.. you can contact Frank (ETZ J60.1) and ask questions VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Ich persönlich traue mich nicht öffentlich Fragen zu stellen bzw. würde sie lieber in einem persönlichen Gespräch mit dem Professor klären. Dies ist leider nicht möglich daher bleiben zumindest bei mir einige Fragen ungeklärt! FPGA boards Digilent ZYBO Z7 ▪ ZYNQ FPGA ▪ Dual core ARM A9 ▪ HDMI in and out ▪ USB connection ▪ Buttons / LEDs VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Exercises ▪ A unique feature of this class, do not miss it ▪ Not many universities can manage this level of exercises ▪ Allows you to apply what you learn in class to practice ▪ Exam questions may come from topics discussed during exercises ▪ Every group gets an FPGA board ▪ Working with FPGAs and practical exercises all the way ▪ Implement your own real-time video processor in hardware ▪ This allows you to work on the exercises outside lab hours as well ▪ Starts TODAY in computer labs ETZ D61/96 ▪ Danilo will give more details VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Exercises are an essential part of this lecture! ▪ You will learn the basics of designing digital integrated circuits and programming FPGAs with hands-on exercises using state-of-the-art industry tools. ▪ The exercises are not only for future ASIC designers, but for everyone working with embedded hardware (e.g., in communication, control, image processing, …). ▪ Great experience for future projects and jobs: Described by alumni from various fields of EE as very relevant and helpful for their day job. ▪ Fun and collaborative learning experience! VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Are the exercises worth my time? ▪ The exercises are not mandatory, but quite essential to have a good “exam experience”. ▪ Your TAs took VLSI 1 course and worked with the tools, so they are able to help you efficiently with many practical tips. ▪ You can choose your pace yourself. ▪ It is very important to follow the exercises ▪ Maybe more than the lectures VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs VLSI 1 Exercises when and where ▪ Two exercise sessions ▪ Tuesdays, 13:15 to 16:00 ▪ Wednesdays, 13:15 to 16:00 ▪ Location (computer rooms) ▪ ETZ D 61.1 ▪ ETZ D 61.2 ▪ ETZ D 96.1 VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Sign up for Exercise Day and Room ▪ You will work in groups of 2 (max. 3). ▪ If you have a partner, select the same option. ▪ If you need a partner, you can either find someone during the exercise or use the Find a Group forum on Moodle.

Use Moodle to exchange with students and instructors ▪ It is not about solving things quickly. The exercises are designed around practical problems that you will encounter in real life. ▪ Prepare: task sheets are online in advance (beginning of the week), so get an overview and read it ▪ Hint: the assistants are more available at the start of the exercises, use this time VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs Further Information ▪ Task sheets available on Moodle ▪ Contact for further questions: vlsi1@iis.ee.ethz.ch ▪ Please use Moodle for all your questions ▪ Note that over e-mail/Moodle we cannot provide you the guidance you get when participating in the exercise classes. Try to take advantage of them as much as possible Hint: At the beginning of the exercise the assistants are less busy with others! VLSI 1: HDL Based Design for FPGAs So be there!
