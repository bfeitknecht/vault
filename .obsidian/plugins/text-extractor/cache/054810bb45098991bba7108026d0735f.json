November 2024 Prof. Ueli Maurer Giovanni Deligios, Dr. Karen Klein Diskrete Mathematik Exercise 9 Exercise 9.5 gives bonus points, which can increase the final grade. The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM24/. 9.1 Diffie-Hellman a) (⋆ ⋆) Since Alice can add much faster than she can multiply, she proposes to execute the Diffie-Hellman protocol using the group ⟨Zn; ⊕⟩ with a generator g ∈ Zn. De- scribe the messages exchanged between Alice and Bob in this case. Show that this protocol is insecure, that is, describe a way in which Eve, who eavesdrops on all exchanged messages, can recover the secret key. b) (⋆ ⋆) Since, by Subtask a), the Diffie-Hellman protocol is insecure in the group ⟨Zn; ⊕⟩ and by Theorem 5.7 every cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to ⟨Zn; ⊕⟩, Bob con- cludes that the protocol is insecure in every cyclic group. Is he right? 9.2 The Group Z∗ m a) (⋆) Determine the order and the elements of the group ⟨Z∗ 36; ⊙⟩. b) (⋆) Determine all generators of the group ⟨Z∗ 11; ⊙⟩. c) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Prove that for any two relatively prime numbers m, n > 0, ⟨Z∗ nm; ⊙⟩ is isomor- phic to ⟨Z∗ n; ⊙⟩ × ⟨Z∗ m; ⊙⟩. 9.3 An Attack on RSA (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Alice, Bob and Charlie use three different RSA keys (n1, 3), (n2, 3) and (n3, 3) respectively. A message m is encrypted for each one of them, resulting in ciphertexts c1, c2 and c3. How can an adversary use these ciphertexts and the public keys to efficiently compute m? 9.4 Elementary Properties of Rings (⋆ ⋆) The goal of this exercise is to prove Lemma 5.17 (ii) and (iii). You can use only Lemma 5.17 (i), which is proved in the lecture notes. In Subtask b), you can use Subtask a). Let ⟨R; +, −, 0, ·, 1⟩ be a ring and let a, b ∈ R. Show that: a) (−a)b = −(ab) b) (−a)(−b) = ab 9.5 More Elementary Properties of Rings (⋆) (8 Points) Let ⟨R; +, −, 0, ·, 1⟩ be a ring, and let a ∈ R and b ∈ R. Prove the following statements: a) If am = bm and an = bn for some positive integers m and n with gcd(m, n) = 1, then a = b. b) If 1 − ab is a unit, then 1 − ba is also a unit. Hint: if x = (1 − ab)−1 consider the ring element 1 + bxa. 9.6 Properties of Commutative Rings (⋆) The goal of this exercise is to prove Lemma 5.19 (ii) and (iii). You cannot use lemmas from the lecture notes. Let ⟨R; +, −, 0, ·, 1⟩ be a commutative ring and let a, b, c ∈ R. Show that: a) If a|b, then a|bc for all c. b) If a|b and a|c, then a|(b + c). 9.7 Ideals in Rings (⋆ ⋆) We generalize the concept of ideal (Definition 4.4) to arbitrary rings. Let ⟨R; +, −, 0, ·, 1⟩ be a commutative ring. A subset I ⊆ R is an ideal of R if • I is a subgroup of ⟨R; +, −, 0⟩. • For all x ∈ I and r ∈ R it holds that x · r ∈ I (an ideal is closed under multiplication with elements of the ring). a) Prove that for all x ∈ Z the subset (x) = {xz | z ∈ Z} is an ideal of Z . b) Let I be an ideal (with this new definition) of Z. Prove that I = (z) for some z ∈ Z. c) Let R be a commutative ring. Let x, y ∈ R. Prove that (x, y) = {xr + ys | r, s, ∈ R} is an ideal of R. d) Consider the ring Z[x] and the ideal (2, x) = {2f (x) + xg(x) | f (x), g(x) ∈ Z[x]}. Prove that there exists no element p(x) ∈ Z(x) such that 1 (p(x)) = {p(x)f (x) | f (x) ∈ Z[x]} = (2, x). Why does the proof of subtask b) break down in this setting? Due by 21. November 2024. Exercise 9.5 is graded. 1Ideals which can be generated by a single element are called principal ideals. A ring in which all ideals are principal (like Z, as you showed in subtask b)) are called principal ideal rings. Subtask d) shows that the ring Z[x] is not a principal ideal ring.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
