Speciﬁcally, M1 = ( Q1 , Σ, δ1 , q0 , F1 ) and M2 = ( Q2 , Σ, δ2 , qc, F2 ) . Then we construct a non-deterministic ﬁnite automaton M as a product of M1 and M2 such that L = L( M) . Formally we deﬁne this as M = ( Q, Γ, δ, q0 , F ) , where Q = Q1 ∪ Q2 denotes the ﬁnite set of states, Γ = {a, b, c} is the input alphabet, δ : Q × Γ → P( Q) the state transition function, q0 is the initial state and F = F2 is the set of accepted states. The state transition function δ of M is the union of δ1 and δ2 , where we deﬁne ( q, c) ∈ F1 × {c} to transition to ⟨ qc⟩ ∈ P( Q2 ) . Informally this is correct because, per construction any word w ∈ L( M) has to have a preﬁx w1 that is accepted by M1 , i.e. w1 ∈ L( M1 ) , then have the inﬁx \"c\" and end in a suﬃx w2 that is accepted by M2 , i.e. w2 ∈ L( M2 ) . Thus M accepts exactly all words in L = L1 ⋅ {c} ⋅ L2 . Since there exist a ﬁnite automaton that accepts L, we have shown that it is regular. □ 18 (a) To prove that there is a strategy that the taster can use to eat all chocolates, we must show that the set of chocolates served to her is equinumerous to the number of rounds. Let i ∈ N denote the i-th round of the game and Ci = {cj∈ [ni]} be the set of |Ci| = ni ∈ N chocolates served in that round. Then C = ⋃i∈ N Ci denotes the set of all chocolates served during the whole game. So we denote the j-th chocolate in the i-th round with cij = cj ∈ Ci. We deﬁne the lexicographic total order on C below. Then the strategy is to simply eat the chocolates in canonical order. cij ≤ lex ci′j′ ⟺ i < i ′ ∨ ( i = i ′ ∧ j < j ′) Since this is the canonical order, we have an injection from C → N and thus it follows that C ∼ N and hence the strategy described above is correct. □ (b) The previously described strategy no longer works, since the number of chocolates served in a particular round is not ﬁnite anymore. We prove the statement by a diagonalization argument. We deﬁne the set C similar to before, where Ci = {cj∈ N} denotes the countably inﬁnite set of chocolates served in round i ∈ N. The diagram below illustrates the order in which we eat the chocolates, where the rows denote the i-th round and the columns represent the j-th chocolate. In this way we enumerate over all chocolates served in all rounds, hence C ∼ N and thus the strategy is correct. □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
