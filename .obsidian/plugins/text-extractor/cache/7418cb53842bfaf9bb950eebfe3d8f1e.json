Theorem — Let p be a prime and (ai)p−1 i=0 a sequence of non-negative integers. We define the polynomial P (x) = p−1∑ i=0 xai. If the terms of the sequence (ai) form a complete residue system modulo p, then the polynomial Q(x) = p−1∑ i=0 xi is a divisor of P . To prove this theorem, we need the following lemma: Lemma — Let ζp ̸= 1 be a p-th root of unity. Then p−1∑ i=0 ζ i p = 0. Proof. We simply note that p−1∑ i=0 ζ i p = ζ p p − 1 ζp − 1 = 1 − 1 ζp − 1 = 0. Thus, Q(ζp) = 0. Next, as ζ p p = 1, we see that ζ n+kp p = ζ n p . Therefore, P (ζp) = Q(ζp) = 0. Since we chose ζp as an arbitrary root of unity, we actually have P (ζp,i) = Q(ζp,i) = 0 for all i = 2, . . . , p, where ζp,i is the i-th p-th root of unity (note that we exclude ζp,1 = 1). Since P (ζp,i) = 0, we know by the fundamental theorem of algebra that the polynomial R(x) = p∏ i=2 (x − ζp,i) is a divisor of P . However, note that the leading coefficient of R is 1, and R has degree p − 1. Since Q(x) has leading coefficient 1, degree p − 1, and has the p − 1 roots ζp,i, we conclude that Q = R. Hence, Q is a divisor of P . 1","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
