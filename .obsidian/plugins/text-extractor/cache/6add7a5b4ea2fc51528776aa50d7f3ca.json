Hint: You may use the Prime Number Theorem for your proof. 10 points Task 8 Design a finite automaton for each of the following languages, using a graphic representation, and determine the class Kl[q] for every state q of your automaton. (a) L1 = {w ∈ {a, b}∗ | w contains the subword abba}, (b) L2 = {w ∈ {a, b}∗ | |w|a ̸= |w|b (mod 2)}. 10 points Task 9 For the following finite automaton M , determine the accepted language L(M ) and the classes Kl[qi] for every state qi.
