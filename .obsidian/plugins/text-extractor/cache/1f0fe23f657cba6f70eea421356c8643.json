Adversary misuses fake certificate to impersonate one party to the other (man-in-the-middle attack) 7 Alice BobMallory Internet Weakness: PKI VulnerabilitiesProblems with SSL / TLS Certificates 8 • Famous case: false Microsoft ActiveX certificate issued by Verisign in January 2001 • VeriSign Hacked, Successfully and Repeatedly, in 2010 - VeriSign attacks were revealed in a quarterly U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing in October 2011 • March 2011: Attack on Commodo reseller, several fraudulent certificates were issued: mail.google.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com, login.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, login.live.com - Suggested that attack originated from Iranian IP address - http://www.comodo.com/Comodo-Fraud-Incident-2011-03-23.html • August 29, 2011: news broke that DigiNotar, a Dutch CA, improperly issued a certificate for all Google domains to an external party - Claim: 250 certificates for an unknown number of domains were released - Iranian government spied on Iranian citizens' communications with Google email during the month of August 2011 • Stuxnet used compromised certificates from 2 Taiwanese CAs Non-Scalability of Trust 9 • As the Internet has grown to encompass a large part of the global population, trust relationships have become heterogeneous: no single entity trusted by everyone - Complicates construction of entity authentication infrastructures • Current Internet authentication infrastructures have weak security properties - Single points of failure - Security of the weakest link 10 Internet Weaknesses are Widely Recognized • Recent paper: Revitalizing the Public Internet By Making it Extensible ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review (CCR), Volume 51 Issue 2, April 2021 • First sentence of introduction: It is well known that the current Internet’s design has many shortcomings. For instance, it was not designed with security in mind, so it is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as distributed denial of service, route spoofing, and DNS hijacking. BGP: Border Gateway Protocol 11 • Designed in 1989 by Lougheed and Rekhter [RFC 1105] • Designed on three paper napkins over lunch Fundamental Limitations of BGP and BGPSEC 12 • Availability - Frequent periods of unavailability when paths change - Slow convergence during iterative route computation - Susceptible to attacks and misconfigurations, sometimes resulting in global outages • Transparency: poor path predictability and reproducibility • Control: Almost no path choice by end points • Trust: Uses very few trust roots (RPKI / BGPSEC) - Single points of failure Internet Attacks and Problems (1/3) BGP / Control Plane Issues 13 • Lack of fault isolation - Error propagation, potentially to entire internet, disruption of flows outside domain - Adversary can attract flows outside domain (prefix hijack/blackhole attacks) - Black art to keep BGP stable, manual rule sets, unanticipated consequences • Lack of scalability, amount of work by BGP is O(N), N number of prefixes - Path changes need to be sent to entire internet • Dramatically higher router overhead during periods of route instability - Increased number of routing updates during DDoS attacks • Short-term loops during periods of convergence, leading to outages during a few seconds - Intermittent routing loops during BGP convergence, need TTL to avoid packet looping • Slow route convergence - Convergence attack - Network can require minutes up to tens of minutes to converge • Lack of freshness for BGP update messages • Cannot express any policies based on source of traffic • Only single path, cannot use multipath • No separation of routing and forwarding, forwarding may suddenly stop during route changes • Slower convergence than BGP • Prefixes cannot be aggregated, much higher overhead • RPKI needs connectivity to verify revocation status of a certificate, thus introducing a circular dependency between routing and cert validation • Single root of trust for AS and address certificates, which leads to a powerful kill switch • Path withdrawals are not secure, path oscillations can be induced by repeatedly announcing / withdrawing path • New attacks are possible • Slow route convergence - Route flap dampening-based attacks: Y.

SCION Overview Summary 8485 Observation: Stable Forwarding + Multi-path Necessary • Single-path forwarding cannot achieve strong availability guarantees - During routing protocol convergence, no path may be available - Equipment failure on path will result in unavailability until routing protocol updates and forwarding tables are adjusted - If forwarding path experiences high packet loss, then path is not usable for practical applications • Approaches - Stable forwarding: packet-carried forwarding state protects forwarding from routing instabilities - Multi-path ensures presence of several paths, so as long as a single path works, end-to- end connectivity is assured Bottleneck Routing Disrupts Availability 86 • Routing protocol switches route traversing a link with limited capacity ( = bottleneck link) • Bottleneck link traversal results in high packet loss • Applications cannot operate and lose connectivity • Since connectivity exists, often manual intervention needed to switch back to alternate path, outage typically persists for 30+ minutes • Frequent reason for outage, caused by misconfiguration or attack Announcement of Failed Routes • In some cases, networks continue to announce routes that failed 87 Example: August 30 CenturyLink/Level(3) Outage https://blog.cloudflare.com/analysis-of-todays-centurylink-level-3-outage “CenturyLink/Level(3)’s network was not honoring route withdrawals and continued to advertise routes to networks like Cloudflare’s even after they’d been withdrawn” Secure routing protocol cannot prevent outages caused by bottleneck link or continuing announcement of failed or congested routes 88 Insight: Secure BGP Insufficient to Achieve High Availability Multi-Path Routing Approaches 89 • For a powerful multi-path system, we need a rich set of path choices: ideally dozens of paths if possible • Problem: most prior multi-path routing algorithms are based on BGP, offering only 2-3 different path choices - Overhead increases linearly in the # of paths: hampering scalability - Notable exceptions: Pathlets, NIRA, HAIR • The path segment combination of SCION provide a rich set of path choices • Extensible architecture: additional path segment generation algorithms can be added, and path server infrastructure can be used for dissemination SCION is Massively Multipath SCION not only finds many disjoint path segments, but enables a massive number of multipath choices through segment combinations In this example, S has 5 path segments to core ASes, D has 6 path segments, and 7 core path segments are provided These path segments enable 54 different end-to-end paths! D SsS D 90 Path Diversity in Production SCION Network Measuring path diversity from ETH to other ASes in production network, we find a minimum of 4 distinct paths and a maximum of 240 paths, with a median of 120 paths 91 Flexibility to Support Different Optimization Criteria • Thanks to massive number of path choices, SCION will likely offer best path for different optimality requirements - Low latency, jitter - High bandwidth - Privacy, anonymity - Low CO2 footprint - Jurisdiction • Application can make use of multiple paths simultaneously and optimise paths for performance New world, offering exciting opportunities! 9293 • Inter-domain multi-path is not a luxury, but a necessity to achieve high availability • Rapid failover without routing system convergence - Routing bottlenecks can be avoided • Enable higher network capacity - No more passive links for redundancy, all links can be active - Simultaneous use of several links • Enables higher communication efficiency - Latency- vs. bandwidth optimal paths can be chosen • Helps defend against DoS attacks, as adversary needs to congest all links • QoS needs multi-path, as several alternatives need to be available to attempt resource reservations Insight: Multi-Path is a Necessity for High Availability and Performance Scalability of SCION Intra-ISD Beaconing SCION Intra-ISD 94 Scalability of SCION Core Beaconing SCION Core 95 SCION Core, BGPSec and BGP Time to Connectivity 96 Time to connectivity in SCION (Min Latency Distribution (99%) of “average length of update bursts per prefix” during May 2020 Scalability Study Results • On a per-path basis, SCION overhead about 200 times lower than BGP, and about 1000 times lower than BGPsec • Time-to-connectivity in SCION is over 3 orders of magnitude faster than BGP - The iterative convergence approach in BGP takes minutes to converge with fully updated forwarding tables (in case of small changes), sometimes even hours in case of large-scale outages 97 SCION Overview 98 • Control plane: How to find end-to-end paths? - Path exploration - Path registration • Data plane: How to send packets - Path lookup - Path combination • Deployment scenarios ISP Deployment (Core AS) 99 Core AS duties • Manage and distribute the ISD's TRC • Sign TRCs of neighboring ISDs and endorse other ISDs • Maintain a list of all recognized ISDs • Issue certificates to ASes in the ISD • Provide connectivity to neighboring ISDs • Generate and disseminate inter-ISD path-segment construction beacons (PCBs), also called core PCBs • Generate and disseminate intra-ISD PCBs • Provide highly available services: beacon, DNS (RHINE), path, certificate, and time servers ISP Deployment (Core AS) 100 Core AS duties • Manage and distribute the ISD's TRC • Sign TRCs of neighboring ISDs and endorse other ISDs • Maintain a list of all recognized ISDs • Issue certificates to ASes in the ISD • Provide connectivity to neighboring ISDs ASes • Generate and disseminate inter-ISD path-segment construction beacons (PCBs), also called core PCBs • Generate and disseminate intra-ISD PCBs • Provide highly available services: beacon, DNS (RHINE), path, certificate, and time servers How to Deploy SCION: ISP 101 • CORE Routers are set up at the borders of an ISP - to peer with other SCION-enabled networks - to collect customer accesses • No change to the internal network infrastructure of an ISP needed!
