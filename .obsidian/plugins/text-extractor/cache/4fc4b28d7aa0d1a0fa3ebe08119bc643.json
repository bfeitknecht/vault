Identify constant dependencies o Which parameters only depend on arguments with constant changes? o That parameter must be outerloop-able (based on the dependencies earlier) o Applies recursively: after space saving one param, you can try to space the inner loops too 2. Replace with variables 3. Move to outer loop and shift o dp[p +- c] -> dp_pc o dp_pc = dp_pf{c - 1} 4. Initialize everything you used o ol ol gets initialized inside, since it's calculated every loop o Everything else must be initialized outside","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"deu+eng"}
