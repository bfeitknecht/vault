Do the coding exercises PVW script is not bad. Pprog from my view ﬁrst semester part – the exam relevant topics are easy Second part more complex, harder? Some concepts from the ﬁrst part reappear in 2nd part Exam topics of 2nd half are o_en more challenging Exercises You will have to hand in several deliverables for each exercise using GIT (no printouts, e-mails, etc.) No bonus points for exercises :( Exercise available on Wednesday Exercise deadline: Wednesday class: Monday Friday class: Wednesday partial hand-ins are also very welcome J❗ Exercise☠ Weekly, I will rank the exercises based on how important& diﬃcult I think they are. ⭐⭐ ☠ ⭐ ❗ highly recommend doing do it if you have some extra free-time (little bit) more challenging you should be able to solve these + Exam 2h wri>en exam (pen & paper) No programming on a PC Doing exercises helps, exam has paper programming exercises DeﬁniXons, coding, applicaXon of the concepts ExamConclusion This session is for you!
