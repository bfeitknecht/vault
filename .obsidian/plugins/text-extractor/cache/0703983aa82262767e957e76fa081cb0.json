L = {xw ∈ Σ ∗ bool | x ∈ Σbool and Number(w) ≡ x (mod 4)} Note: For w = w1w2 . . . wn ∈ Σ ∗ bool we define Number(w) := ∑n i=1 wi · 2 n−i. 10 points Task 11 Using the paradigm of modular design (product automaton construction), construct a finite automaton for the language L = {w ∈ {a, b} ∗ | |w|a ≡ 1 (mod 3) or |w| = 2} Include the graphical representation of each partial automaton and determine the class Kl[q] for every state q of your partial automata. 10 points Task 12 (a) Use a direct argumentation via the automaton (using Lemma 3.12, i.e., Lemma 3.3 in the German version of the book) to prove that the language L1 = {w ∈ {a, b, c}∗ | w contains the subword ab equally as often as the subword ba} is not regular. (b) Use the pumping lemma for regular languages to prove that the language L2 = {wabwR | w ∈ {a, b}∗} is not regular. Here, wR denotes the reversal of w. 10 points Submission: On Friday, October 18, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
