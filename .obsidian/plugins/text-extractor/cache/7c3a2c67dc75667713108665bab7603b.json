November 2024 Prof. Ueli Maurer Giovanni Deligios, Dr. Karen Klein Diskrete Mathematik Exercise 10 Exercise 10.5 gives bonus points, which can increase the final grade. The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM24/. 10.1 Warm-Up (⋆) a) What is the definition of a field? b) What is the definition of a root of a polynomial a(x) ∈ R[x]? c) Is the polynomial b(x) = x2 + 2 ∈ GF(3)[x] irreducible? If not, give its factorization. 10.2 Integral Domains and Fields a) (⋆) Recall an example of an integral domain that is not a field. b) (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) Prove that every finite integral domain D is a field. Hint: For an a ∈ D \\ {0}, consider the function fa(x) = a · x. 10.3 Polynomials over a Field (⋆) a) Divide x5 + 6x2 + 5 by 5x2 + 2x + 1 over Z7 with remainders. b) Determine all irreducible polynomials of degree 4 over GF(2). 10.4 The Ring F [x]m(x) (⋆ ⋆) a) Find all zero-divisors in the ring GF(3)[x]x2+2x. b) Determine all elements of GF(3)[x]x2+2 and of the multiplicative group GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2. c) Compute the inverse of the polynomial x in GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2. 10.5 Extension Fields (⋆) (8 Points) Let F = Z3[x]x3+2x2+1. a) Prove that F is a field. b) Find a generator of F ∗. Show your work. c) Find all roots of a(y) = y2 + 2y(x2 + x) + (x2 + 2) in F [y]. Show your work. 10.6 Secret Sharing (⋆ ⋆) We find ourselves on a lonely island, where the ballistic missile system can be activated with a secret key s ∈ GF(q) (where q is a prime). This key is distributed among n < q generals G1, . . . , Gn as follows: random coefficients a1, . . . , at−1 ∈ GF(q) are chosen, such that a(x) def = at−1xt−1 + . . . + a1x + s. Each general Gi receives a share si = a(αi), where α1, . . . , αn are publicly known and pair- wise distinct values from GF(q) \\ {0}. a) All except t generals die on a fishing trip. Show that the key is not lost, because it can be determined uniquely from t shares. b) Mario (one of the generals) wants to resolve a dispute with his neighbor by using a ballistic missile. In order to determine the key s, he has collected a total of t − 1 shares (including her own share). How many values from GF(q) are still possible for the key, given t − 1 shares? Prove your answer. 10.7 Structure of Multiplicative Groups of Finite Fields (⋆ ⋆ ⋆) In this exercise we break down the proof of Theorem 5.40 from the lecture notes in smaller steps. Let F be a finite field and let n = |F ∗|. a) Let a, b ∈ Z. Prove that gcd(a, b) = d ⇐⇒ d | a and d | b and gcd ( a d , b d ) = 1. b) For d | n define A(d) = {k ∈ {1, . . . , n} | gcd(k, n) = d}. Use subtask a) to prove that |A(d)| = φ ( n d ). c) Use subtask b) to prove that ∑ d|n φ ( n d ) = n. d) Use subtask c) to prove n = ∑ d|n φ(d). e) Let B(d) = {k ∈ F ∗ | ord(k) = d}. Show that |B(d)| ∈ {0, φ(d)}. Hint: consider the polynomial xd − 1 ∈ F [x]. f) Use subtasks d) and e) to show that if d | n then |B(d)| = φ(d). g) Use subtask f) to conclude that F ∗ is cyclic.
