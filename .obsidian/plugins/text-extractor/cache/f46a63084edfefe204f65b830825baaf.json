This booklet consists of 4 pages; the back page of this booklet is page 4. After the quiz begins, check that your quiz papers are complete. There are 2 assignments. 2. Only write on the quiz paper and extra paper sheets which are given by the assistants. Do not take any of this paper out of the quiz: submit it all. 3. This is a closed book quiz: the only resources allowed are pen and paper. No laptops, no cell phones, no smart watches, no prepared notes. Do not use pencil and do not use red. 4. You may use any functions from the Haskell Prelude in your solutions (without giving their deﬁnitions). 5. Write clearly in the sense of logic, language, and readability. Label all rule applications in your derivation trees. The clarity of your arguments and explanations aﬀects your grade. 6. You have 30 minutes to complete the quiz.

A ∀I ∗ Γ Ø ∀x. A Γ Ø A[x ( t] ∀E Γ Ø A[x ( t] Γ Ø ∃x. A ∃I Γ Ø ∃x. A Γ, A Ø B Γ Ø B ∃E ∗∗ Side conditions: (∗) x is not free in any formula in Γ, (∗∗) x is neither free in B nor in any formula in Γ. Using the above rules, prove that ›∃x. ¬p(x) ∨ q(x)” → ›∀x. p(x)” → ∃x. q(x) is valid. Give a complete derivation tree and label each inference step with the name of the corresponding rule.

For example, gaps [1,2,3,4,5] = [[2,3,4,5],[1,3,4,5],[1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,5],[1,2,3,4]] gaps [] = [] gaps [8,3] = [[3],[8]] The order in which the lists are returned does not matter. For example, gaps [1,2,3,4,5] = [[1,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,5],[1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,4]] is also a valid result.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
