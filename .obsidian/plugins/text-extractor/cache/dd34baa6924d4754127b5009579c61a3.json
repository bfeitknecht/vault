The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 5.1 Computing Representations of Relations (⋆) For the relation ρ = {(1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 2)} on the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, determine the relations ρ3 and ρ∗. Describe ρ3 using the set representation, and ρ∗ using matrix representation. 5.2 Operations on Relations (⋆ ⋆) Let us consider the relations <, | and ≡2 on the set of positive natural numbers N \\ {0}. For each of the following relations on N \\ {0}, decide whether it is reﬂexive, symmetric or transitive. Justify your answers. a) < ◦ | b) | ∪ ≡2 c) | ∪ |−1 5.3 A False Proof (⋆) Consider a non-empty set A and a symmetric and transitive relation ρ ̸= ∅ on A. a) The following proof shows that ρ is always reﬂexive. Find the mistake in this proof. Proof: We show that ρ is reﬂexive, that is that for any x, we have x ρ x. Let x ∈ A. Further, let y ∈ A be such that x ρ y. Since ρ is symmetric, it follows that y ρ x. Now we have x ρ y and y ρ x. Hence, by the transitivity of ρ, it follows that x ρ x. b) Show that the above statement is indeed false, that is, prove that ρ is not always reﬂexive. 5.4 An Equivalence Relation (⋆ ⋆) The relation ∼ on R2 \\ {(0, 0)} is deﬁned as follows: (x1, y1) ∼ (x2, y2) def ⇐⇒ ∃λ > 0 (x1, y1) = (λx2, λy2) a) Prove that ∼ is an equivalence relation. b) Describe geometrically the equivalence classes [(x, y)]. 5.5 Order Relations on Quotient Sets (⋆) (8 Points) Let (A, ≤) be a well-ordered poset. For all ∅ ̸= A′ ⊆ A we denote by least(A′) the least element of A′. Let θ be an equivalence relation on A. We deﬁne the following relation ρ on A/θ: [a]θ ρ [b]θ ⇐⇒ least([a]θ) ≤ least([b]θ). Show that (A/θ, ρ) is a poset. 5.6 Lifting an Operation to Equivalence Classes (⋆ ⋆) In the lecture (and in Section 3.4.3 of the lecture notes), we have considered the following equivalence relation ∼ on the set A def = Z × (Z \\ {0}): (a, b) ∼ (c, d) def ⇐⇒ ad = bc. We then deﬁned the rational numbers Q def = A/∼, capturing the fact that each rational number has different representations as fractions. The goal of this exercise is to understand how to deﬁne an operation on equivalence classes (e.g., the sum of two rational numbers) by lifting an operation deﬁned at the level of the elements of the equivalence classes (e.g., the fractional representations A of the rationals). Consider an equivalence relation θ on some set B and a function f : B2 → B. We want to lift f to the set of equivalence classes B/θ, i.e., we want to deﬁne a function F : (B/θ)2 → (B/θ) canonically in terms of f . For this to be meaningful, f has to be θ-consistent. That is, if f is applied to a pair (b1, b2) ∈ B2, the equivalence class [f (b1, b2)]θ may only depend on the equivalence classes [b1]θ and [b2]θ (irrespective of which concrete elements both b1 and b2 are within their equivalence classes). a) Deﬁne the sum of two fractional representations of rational numbers as a function sum : A2 → A (for A = Z × (Z \\ {0}) as deﬁned above), using standard addition and multiplication in the integers. b) Express formally what it means for a function f : B2 → B to be θ-consistent for an equivalence relation θ on B. Hint: For example, the function sum deﬁned in Subtask a) being ∼-consistent captures the fact that when adding two rational numbers x and y, we can add two arbitrary fractional representations of x and y from the set A (by applying sum), and the rational number obtained does not depend on which representation of x and y was used. c) Prove that the function sum : A2 → A deﬁned in Subtask a) is ∼-consistent.
