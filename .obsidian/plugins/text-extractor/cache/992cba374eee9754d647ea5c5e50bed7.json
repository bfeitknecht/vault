Let X be a random variable with well-defined positive variance. Find a ∈ R and b > 0 such that for Z := (X − a)/b, it holds that E[Z] = 0 and Var[Z] = 1. (Exactly one answer is correct.)

Let X1, . . . , Xn be independent random variables with Xi ∼ N (θαi, 1), where αi ̸= 0 are known parameters, but θ ∈ R is unknown. Find the maximum likelihood estimator for θ. Exercise 11.5. In a sawmill, the sawn timber of a certain sorting class undergoes quality control. Each production day, a sample of ten boards is taken, and each board is tested for its stiffness. Based on experience, it can be assumed that the stiffness of a board is normally distributed with a known standard deviation σ = 1430 MPa1. (a) Derive the formula for the 95% confidence interval for µ after 15 production days. You can assume that the samples are mutually independent. (b) Compute the realized confidence interval from (a) for a sample mean of x = 11,000 MPa (after 15 production days). (c) How many samples would be required to ensure that the width of the confidence interval is less than 200 MPa? Exercise 11.6. Let Θ = [1/2, 1]. We consider the model family (Pθ)θ∈Θ, where X1, . . . , Xn are independent and identically distributed under Pθ with X1 ∼ Geom(θ). The maximum likelihood estimator for θ is given by (check!) TM L = n ∑n i=1 Xi . Find an approximate 95% confidence interval for θ. Hint: For all θ ∈ [1/2, 1], we have √1−θ θ ≤ √2. You can use this to simplify the expression. Note that enlarging the interval only increases the probability of coverage. However, for θ close to 1, the interval might be unnecessarily wide. Hint 2: Recall that we know that Eθ[X1] = 1 θ and Varθ[X1] = 1 − θ θ2 . Remark: In practice, if the variance is unknown, we typically replace it with an estimate. Either we use the generic estimator ˆσ2 n = 1 n − 1 n∑ i=1(Xi − X n) 2, or, since in this case Var[X1] = 1−θ θ2 and we have an estimator for θ, we can also use ˜σ2 n = 1 − TM L T 2 M L . As both estimators are consistent in this case, we still have by Slutsky’s theorem that ∑n i=1 Xi − n θ√ nˆσ2 n ≈ N (0, 1) and ∑n i=1 Xi − n θ√n˜σ2 n ≈ N (0, 1). Exercise 11.7. To estimate the number N of trout in a lake, the following procedure is used (capture- recapture method): In a first step, 500 trout are caught, marked, and released back into the lake. In a second step, 200 trout are caught again, and the number X of marked trout is recorded. 1The pascal is a derived SI unit of pressure and mechanical stress. It is named after Blaise Pascal and defined as follows: 1 Pa = 1 kg×m−1×s−2 = 1 N×m−2. One pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of one newton on an area of one square meter. 1 MPa = 106 Pa = 10 bar. 2 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek (a) X is modeled as a binomial random variable, X ∼ Binom(n, θ), where θ denotes the probability that a fish caught in the second step is marked. What is the value of n? What is the value of the parameter θ if the total number of trout in the lake is N = 2000 or N = 5000? (b) The actual observed value for X is 40. Give a reasonable estimate for the parameter θ, and derive from it an estimate for the total number N of trout in the lake. (c) Determine an approximate 95% confidence interval for θ, and from that, an approximate 95% confidence interval for N . 3 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Quantile table for the standard normal distribution 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.95 0.975 0.99 0.995 0.999 0 0.6745 1.2816 1.6449 1.9600 2.3263 2.5758 3.0902 .
