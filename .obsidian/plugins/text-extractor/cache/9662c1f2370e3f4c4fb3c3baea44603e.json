In accordance with recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Système International d’Unités (SI), we use U as quantity symbol for voltage and V as unit symbol for volt to clearly distinguish the two. Also, V collides with volume. A renowned US publication that adheres to this practice much as our text does is [235]. 548 APPENDIX C SYMBOLS AND CONSTANTS C.3 PHYSICAL AND MATERIAL CONSTANTS Table C.2 Selected physical constants.

Permittivity is not a constant either and tends to diminish with frequency, although not necessarily in a monotonic fashion. A note on carbon allotropes What makes carbon so special is that it comes in many allotropic variations [245]. Diamond forms a tetrahedral crystal lattice where carbon atoms sit in the corners and are held together by covalent bonds exactly as in monocrystalline silicon. This spatial arrangement with four strong bonds oriented around each nucleus renders diamond extremely hard and durable. The large bandgap of about 5.5 eV makes it an electrical insulator and optically transparent.

The data on graphene are incomplete and must be considered unreliable as the material has no history as an industrial semiconductor so far.

Feb 2011) 550 APPENDIX C SYMBOLS AND CONSTANTS Graphene is the name given to a single layer of carbon atoms where each nucleus sits in the corner of a hexagon and is covalently bonded to three neighbors such as to form a planar lattice reminiscent of chicken wire [246] [247]. Graphite is a three-dimensional structure where many such sheets are held together by much weaker Van der Waal forces which explains why graphite appears soft and slick. Bandgap is almost zero which means that valence and conduction bands barely touch. As a consequence, graphite has a mediocre electrical conductivity and is sometimes termed a semimetal or metalloid. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) can be thought of as graphene sheets that have rolled up. Note that the rolling up occurs at specific and discrete angles (just compare with forming tubes from a gift wrap paper that carries some periodic pattern). CNTs exist as multi-walled and as single-walled hollow cylinders, straight or twisted. Diameter is a little over 1 nm for a single-walled nanotube, and up to 50 nm for multi-walled nanotubes. Depending on diameter and rolling angle, CNTs can have band gaps as low as zero (as metal), as high as that of silicon, and almost anywhere in between. Fullerenes are spherical macromolecules that resemble soccer balls. Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes share an extraordinary strength and stability. The lampblack deposits that form when organic fuels are burned with a lack of sufficient oxygen largely consist of amorphous carbon with no long-range pattern of atomic positions.
