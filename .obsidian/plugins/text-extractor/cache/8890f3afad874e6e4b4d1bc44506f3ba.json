The implication that if a relation ρ on a set A is symmetric then it’s composition with itself ρ 2 is also symmetric trivially holds. However, the opposite direction doesn‘t hold. For the sake of contradiction, let us assume that if ρ 2 is symmetric, then also ρ is symmetric. Let ρ 2 = ∅, which is symmetric by deﬁnition 3.15. Let a, b ∈ A. We present as counterexample the relation on A deﬁned as ρ = {(a, b)} and thus arrive at a contradiction, since ρ is not symmetric. □ b) True. By the symmetry of the relation ρ on A (deﬁnition 3.15) we have a ρ b ⟺ b ρ a for all a, b ∈ A. Then by antisymmetry (deﬁnition 3.16), we have a ρ b ∧ b ρ a ⟹ a = b. We note that the left hand side of the implication is exactly given by symmetry of the relation, i.e. ρ = {(a, a) ∣ ∀a ∈ A} = idA. □ c) True. We can denote the given relations using set builder notation. The ﬁrst one is ρ1 = {(a, b) ∣ a, b ∈ Z : b = a + 1} and the second one ρ2 = {(c, d) ∣ c, d ∈ Z : c ≡ 2 d}. Then their union is ρ = ρ1 ∪ ρ2 = {(x, y) ∣ x, y ∈ Z : x ρ1 y ∨ x ρ2 y}. Furthermore, we have ρ 2 = {(x, z) ∣ x, z ∈ Z, ∃y ∈ Z : x ρ y ∧ y ρ z} First, we will show that ρ 2 ⊆ Z × Z. Now we will show that Z × Z ⊆ ρ 2. For this we will use fact (1) that F ⟹ F ∨ G. Thus we have shown that ρ 2 = Z × Z. □ ρ 2 ⊆ Z × Z ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ ρ 2 → (x, z) ∈ Z × Z) (def. ⊆ ) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∉ ρ 2 ∨ (x, z) ∈ Z × Z) (def. ×) ⋅ ⟺ ⊤ □ Z × Z ⊆ ρ 2 ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ Z × Z → (x, z) ∈ ρ 2) (def. ⊆ ) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)(((x, z) ∉ Z × Z) ∨ (x, z) ∈ ρ 2) (1) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ ρ 2) (def. ρ 2) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ {(x, z) ∣ x, z ∈ Z, ∃y ∈ Z : x ρ y ∧ y ρ z}) (def. ρ) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ {(x, z) ∣ x, z ∈ Z, ⊤ }) (tautology) ⋅ ⟺ ∀(x, z)((x, z) ∈ {(x, z) ∣ x, z ∈ Z}) □","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
