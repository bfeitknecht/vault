{"path":"var/export/DMath-bf-u05.pdf","text":"Basil Feitknecht, 23-922-099 5.5 Prove or disprove the following claims. a) False. The implication that if a relation ρ on a set A is symmetric then it’s composition with itself ρ2 is also symmetric trivially holds. However, the opposite direction doesn‘t hold. For the sake of contradiction, let us assume that if ρ2 is symmetric, then also ρ is symmetric. Let ρ2 = ∅, which is symmetric by deﬁnition 3.15. Let a,b ∈ A. We present as counterexample the relation on A deﬁned as ρ = {(a,b)} and thus arrive at a contradiction, since ρ is not symmetric. □ b) True. By the symmetry of the relation ρ on A (deﬁnition 3.15) we have a ρ b ⟺ b ρ a for all a,b ∈ A. Then by antisymmetry (deﬁnition 3.16), we have a ρ b ∧ b ρ a ⟹ a = b. We note that the left hand side of the implication is exactly given by symmetry of the relation, i.e. ρ = {(a,a)∣ ∀a ∈ A}= idA. □ c) True. Let a,b,c ∈ Z. Then we can denote the given relations using set builder notation as ρ1 = {(a,b)∣ a + 1= b} and ρ2 = {(a,b)∣ a ≡2 b}. Thus the relation deﬁned as their union is given by ρ = ρ1∪ ρ2 = {(a,b)∣ (a,b)∈ ρ1∨ (a,b)∈ ρ2}. We will now show that ρ2 = Z × Z by a series of equivalence transformations. ρ2 = {(a,c)∣ ∃b ∈ Z : (a,b),(b,c)∈ ρ} (def. ρ) = {(a,c)∣ ∃b ∈ Z : (a,b),(b,c)∈ ρ1∨ (a,b),(b,c)∈ ρ2} (def. ρ1,ρ2) = {(a,c)∣ ∃b ∈ Z : (a + 1= b ∧ b + 1= c)∨ (a ≡2 b ∧ b ≡2 c)} (def. Z) = {(a,c)∣ ⊤}= Z × Z □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
