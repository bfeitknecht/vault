The equality can be rewritten as: n∑ i=1 i(i + 1) 2 = Θ(n3) To prove the equality, we need to show that the left-hand side grows at a rate that is bounded by and bounds n3. n∑ i=1 i(i + 1) 2 = n(n + 1)(n + 2) 6 = Θ(n3) Dividing both sides of the inequality by n3 gives: c1 ≤ (n + 1)(n + 2) 6n2 ≤ c2 Now, let’s evaluate the limit of the middle term as n approaches infinity: lim n→∞ (n + 1)(n + 2) 6n2 = 1 6 Thus, the middle term converges to 1 6 as n approaches infinity. We can choose c1 = 1 12 and c2 = 1 6 , which are positive constants that satisfy the inequality for sufficiently large n: 1 12 · n3 ≤ n(n + 1)(n + 2) 6 ≤ 1 6 · n3 This completes the proof, demonstrating that ∑n i=1 ∑i j=1 j is indeed in the Θ(n3) class. 1 3.1. b) 3) To prove or disprove the statement: log(n4 + n3 + n2) ≤ O(log(n3 + n2 + n)) Let’s break it down step by step: First, let’s analyze the left side: log(n4 + n 3 + n2) This can be simplified using logarithm properties: log(n4 + n3 + n2) = log(n2(n2 + n + 1)) Now, let’s analyze the right side: O(log(n3 + n2 + n)) We can observe that the largest term in the parentheses on the right side is n3, so we can write this as: O(log(n 3(1 + 1 n + 1 n2 )) Now, we can use logarithmic properties to simplify this: O(log(n3) + log(1 + 1 n + 1 n2 )) The logarithmic term on the right can be bounded by log(1 + 1 n + 1 n2 ) ≤ log(1 + 1 n ). Now, we have: O(log(n3) + log(1 + 1 n )) Since log(n3) is dominated by 3 log(n), and log(1 + 1 n ) grows very slowly as n becomes large, we can conclude that: log(n4 + n3 + n2) ≤ O(3 log(n)) So, the statement is proven: log(n4 + n3 + n2) ≤ O(3 log(n)) 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
