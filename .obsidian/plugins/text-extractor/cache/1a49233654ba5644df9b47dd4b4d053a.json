While I was fortunate enough to author the book, I am indebted to all those who have been willing to share their expertise with me. My thanks thus go to many past and present colleagues of mine including Christoph Balmer, David Bellasi, Prof. Andreas Burg, Dr. Felix Bürgin, Dr. Norbert Felber, Prof. em. Wolfgang Fichtner, Michael Gautschi, Dr. Pierre Greisen, Dr. Frank Gürkaynak, Christoph Keller, Prof. Mathieu Luisier, Dr. Patrick Mächler, Beat Muheim, Michael Mühlberghuber, Michael Schaffner, Prof. Christoph Studer, Prof. Jürgen Wassner, Dr. Markus Wenk, Prof. Paul Zbinden, and Dr. Reto Zimmermann. As long-time VHDL users, our staff and me are grateful to Dr. Christoph Sühnel who made us become fluent in SystemVerilog with as few detours and misunderstandings as possible. Most of these experts have contributed examples, have reviewed parts of my manuscript, or have otherwise helped improve its quality. Still, the only person to blame for all errors and other shortcomings that have remained in the text is me. Next, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all students who have followed our courses on Digital VLSI Design and Test. Not only their comments and questions, but also results and data from many of their projects have found their way into this text. Sebastian Axmann deserves special credit for helping with the solutions on a voluntary basis. Giving students the opportunity to design microchips, to have them fabricated, and to test physical samples is a rather onerous undertaking that would clearly have been impossible without the continuous funding by ETH Zürich. Let me express our gratitude for that on behalf of all our graduates. In cooperation with Christoph Wicki and his IT support team, the staff of the local Microelectronics Design Center does a superb job in setting up and maintaining the EDA infrastructure and the services indispensable for VLSI design in spite of the frequent landslides caused by rapid technological evolution and by unforeseeable business changes. I am particularly grateful to them for occasionally filling all sorts of gaps in my technical knowledge without making me feel too badly about it. I am further indebted to Todd Green, Nate McFadden, Poulouse Joseph, and many more members of the staff at Morgan Kaufmann Publishers for their support with turning my LaTeX manuscript into a printed book. Finally, I would like to thank all persons and organizations who have taken their time to answer my reprint requests and who have granted me the right to reproduce illustrations of theirs. xix","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
