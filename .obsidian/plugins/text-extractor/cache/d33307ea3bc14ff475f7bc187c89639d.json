Let Z be a random variable with distribution function: FZ(z) =    0, if z < 0, 0.1, if 0 ≤ z < 1, 0.5, if 1 ≤ z < 3, 0.8, if 3 ≤ z < 5, 1, if z ≥ 5. (Exactly one answer is correct in each question.) 1. Is E[Z] ≥ 3? (a) Yes. (b) No. 2. Is P[Z ≤ 3] = P[Z ≥ 3]? (a) Yes. (b) No. 3. Is P[3.5 ≤ Z ≤ 5.5] = 0.2? (a) Yes. (b) No. 4. What is E[Z 2]? (a) E[Z 2] = 8.1. (b) E[Z 2] = 3.5. (c) E[Z 2] = 21. (d) Doesn’t exist. (e) E[Z 2] = ∞. 5. Is P[Z = 0] = 0? (a) Yes. (b) No. Exercise 7.2. Let r > 1 and define f : R → R by f (x) = { 0 for x ≤ 1, cx −r for x > 1, for some constant c ∈ R. 1 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek (a) Determine the constant c such that f is a density. (b) Let X be a random variable with density fX = f . Compute the cumulative distribution function of X. (c) Compute the expected value of X. For which values of r is the expected value finite? Exercise 7.3. k ∈ N hunters each shoot once simultaneously at a flock of m ∈ N ducks. They independently choose which duck to aim at, and they hit their chosen duck independently of each other and independently of the duck selected, with probability p ∈ (0, 1). Introduce for each duck n ∈ {1, . . . , m} a random variable Xn indicating whether the duck was hit (by at least one hunter) or not. We define {Xn = 1} = “n-th duck not hit” and {Xn = 0} = “n-th duck hit”. (a) What is the distribution of Xn for n = 1, . . . , m? (b) What is the expected number of unharmed ducks? (c) Are the events {Xn = 0}, n ∈ {1, . . . , m} independent? Consider only the case k < m for simplicity. Exercise 7.4. We consider a circle which has a random radius R. The radius R is exponentially distributed with expectation 1/λ for some λ > 0. Let us denote by A the (random) area of this circle. Determine: (a) The distribution function and the density function of A; (b) The expected value of A. Exercise 7.5. A random variable X has the density function: f (x) =    c (1 + x)5 , x > 0, 0, x ≤ 0. (a) Find the value of c and the distribution function of X. (b) Find E[X] and E[X 2]. Hint: It might be easier to first compute E[1 + X] and E[(1 + X)2] and then use linearity. (c) What are the distribution function and the density of Y := eX ? 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
