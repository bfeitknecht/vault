At the transport layer, demultiplexing is the job of delivering data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket. B. Typically the client side of the application assigns a speciﬁc port, whereas the server side of the application lets the transport layer automatically assign the port number. C.

The Application Layer (25 points) (a) (6 points) DNS resolution. Authoritative DNS server (ns1.ethz.ch) TLD (.ch) DNS server (a.nic.ch) Root DNS server (a.root-servers.net) Target host (www.ethz.ch) Local DNS server (dns.swisscom.ch) Requesting host 1 8 2 4 6 7 5 3 Figure 1: Combination of recursive and iterative resolution. In Figure 1, a DNS scenario is shown. Assume there is no caching. The requesting host sends a recursive DNS resolution request for www.ethz.ch to its local DNS server (1). The local DNS server then performs iterative queries to ﬁnd the answer to the query (2-7), and returns the result (8). i. (1 point) Select one: which type of record is returned in (8)? A. A record B. NS record ii. (1 point) How many DNS queries would the requesting host send out if it did the iterative querying itself? Assume there is no caching. Only give the ﬁnal answer, no explanation is needed. iii. (2 points) There are 13 root DNS servers. Which statement(s) are true? A. Each root server is replicated multiple times across the globe using the same IP address of that particular root to leverage BGP anycast. B. All 13 root servers collectively have knowledge of all TLD servers, but not neces- sarily each root server individually has that knowledge of all TLD servers. C. Choosing which root server to query should be done randomly to aid load bal- ancing. D. Often the root servers don’t have to be queried, because the client or its local DNS server often have many of the TLD resolutions already cached. iv. (2 points) DNSSEC is an extension of DNS to address its security ﬂaws. The existence of this extension suggests that DNS has security ﬂaws. Which of the following security features does plain DNS not guarantee? A. Data origin authenticity: the response a requesting resolver receives actually came from the zone where it believes the data originated. B. Data integrity protection: the requesting resolver knows that the data hasn’t been modiﬁed in transit. C. Data conﬁdentiality: unauthorized parties (e.g., routers in-between) cannot read the content of a DNS request or response. Page 4 (b) (7 points) Bloom ﬁlters. We have a Bloom ﬁlter of m bits and k hash functions h1, h2, ..., hk, each of which hashes to the range {1, 2, ..., m}. n elements have already been inserted into the Bloom ﬁlter, i. (1 point) What’s the probability of a false negative (the Bloom ﬁlter claims that an element is not present even though it is present)? Provide a brief explanation. ii. (2 points) What’s the probability of a bit in the Bloom ﬁlter being 0? Provide a brief explanation. iii. (2 points) What’s the probability of a false positive (the Bloom ﬁlter claims that an element is present even though it is not present)? Provide a brief explanation. iv. (2 points) What approximate (in the limit) value of k minimizes this false positive proba- bility?A. n m B. n m ln(2) C. m n D. m n ln(2) Page 5 (c) (4 points) Load balancing. Assume we have n cache servers. Each server can process and reply to any request. There are also exactly n requests. When a request comes in, it must be decided to which of the n servers it goes to. i. (1 point) The expected maximum load on a server by choosing the server uniformly at random is... A. O(ln(n)) B. O(ln(ln(n)) C. O ( ln(n) ln(ln(n)) ) D. O ( ln(ln(n)) ln(2) ) ii. (1 point) By selecting two servers randomly and choosing the server with the least load, the expected maximum load on any server decreases... A. ...linearly (i.e., addition of a constant factor). B. ...multiplicatively (i.e., multiplied with a constant factor). C. ...logarithmically. iii. (2 points) An alternative to the direct approach of assigning a server uniformly at random is consistent hashing. Which statement(s) are true? A. The primary motivation for consistent hashing is that it better (than picking uniformly at-random) handles a varying n (in other words, when a new server is added or an existing one fails). B. In order to reduce variance in the maximum load, only a single place is assigned for each cache server within the circular space to which the hash functions map. C. By picking uniformly at random (through hashing), the expected load of each cache server is 1 n -th fraction of the objects. D. With consistent hashing, the expected load of each cache server is 1 n -th fraction of the objects. Page 6 (d) (8 points) Video Streaming. Let V be a video stream with N ≥ 3 diﬀerent quality levels with indices 0, 1, ..., N − 1. Assume all video chunks to have the same duration D in seconds and, for the same quality level Qi, the same size Si in bytes. A buﬀer-based adaptation algorithm decision space is represented in Figure 2. The given algorithm depends on two parameters, α and β with β > α, and maps the current buﬀer level B to a quality index Q. In particular: Q = f (B) :    0 if 0 ≤ B ≤ α ⌊ N −1 β−α · (B − α)⌋ if α < B < β N − 1 if β ≤ B ≤ BM ax The BBA algorithm takes the decision for segment j + 1 once segment j has been downloaded. Figure 2: Buﬀer-based algorithm decision space i. (6 points) For each of the following statements, indicate True/False and provide a brief explanation why. A. For a ﬁxed β, decreasing α increases the risk of rebuﬀering. B. For a ﬁxed α, increasing β increases the risk of rebuﬀering. C. For a ﬁxed α, increasing β increases the probability of having the segments down- loaded in full resolution Qmax = QN −1. D. For ﬁxed α and β, increasing Bmax decreases the chances of downloading segments at lowest quality Qmin = Q0. Page 7 E. If α < D, the player will never download segments at the lowest resolution. F. If no other routine has been implemented, the startup quality will always be Q0 (the lowest). ii. (2 points) Let’s assume α = 5, β = 10, D = 3 and N = 6. The buﬀer level when the j-th quality decision was made is Bj. At that moment, it is decided to download the j-th segment at the lowest resolution Q0. Bandwidth is inﬁnite. This means that the next quality decision is made with a buﬀer of size Bj+1 = Bj + D. Is it possible for that the next quality decision is for full resolution Qmax = QN −1? If yes, for which values of Bj? Page 8 3. The Transport Layer (25 points) (a) (5 points) TCP phase switches. A TCP connection uses fast-retransmit/recovery, timeouts, congestion avoidance and slow start. Figure 3 shows an example of the change in the size of the congestion window of such a TCP connection over time (in RTTs). (The initial ssthresh is set to 8 packets). (The duration of the timeout is 1 RTT.) At the time points in the table, a certain event happened, which caused TCP to switch from congestion avoidance to slow start or from slow start to congestion avoidance. Derive from the ﬁgure, which events happened when, and ﬁll them into the table: the possible events are (a) ssthresh reached (SSR), (b) timeout occurred (TIMEOUT), or (c) a fast-retransmit/recovery (FAST). Exactly one event type occurred at each time point. Each event type can have occurred zero or more times overall. The grading of this question is based only on the table (no explanation is required). Time point in RTTs Event 3 7 18 22 24 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 0 5 10 15 20 Figure 3: Congestion window size in packets (y-axis) against time in number of RTTs (x-axis) Page 9 (b) (3 points) Go-Back-N. Consider a Go-Back-N sender and receiver directly connected by a 10 Mbps link with a one-way propagation delay of 100 milliseconds. (There is no out-of-order buﬀering because it is Go-Back-N.) The retransmission timer is set to 2 seconds and the window has a length of 2 segments. The sender’s timeout timer is reset each time an ACK is received, even if it is a duplicate. An ACK is transmitted as soon as the last bit of the corresponding data segment is received and the size of the ACK is negligibly small. 4 segments are to be sent, and each segment contains 10000 bits. The ﬁrst transmission of the 3rd segment is dropped. All other transmissions of segments and acknowledgments are successful. Fill in the table below with the acknowledgement times of the segments. The acknowledgement time is the moment at which the sender has a segment cumulatively acknowledged and as such can move the window. Hint: We suggest drawing a time sequence diagram (e.g., Figure 4) before ﬁlling in the table. The grading of this question is based only on the table (no explanation is required).

Consider the sliding window shown in Fig. 5. 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 31 1 312 313 314 315 316 SND.UNA SND.NXT Figure 5: A sender sliding window. This sliding window uses packets as its smallest, indivisible unit. The sliding window is main- tained using two integer variables: SND.UNA, which is the lowest packet sequence number which is not acknowledged, and SND.NXT, which is the lowest packet sequence number that has not yet been sent out. Answer the following questions (without accounting for sequence number wrap-around). i. (1 point) SND.NXT must be .............. SND.UNA A. greater than (>) B. greater than or equal to (≥) C. less than (<) D. less than or equal to (≤) ii. (1 point) What is the current window size (in other words, how many data packets are outstanding in the network)? A. SND.NXT B. SND.UNA C. SND.NXT - SND.UNA D. SND.UNA - SND.NXT iii. (1 point) Let MAXWND be the maximum window size. Which invariant must hold? A. SND.NXT ≤ SND.UNA + MAXWND B. SND.NXT ≥ SND.UNA + MAXWND C. SND.NXT ≤ MAXWND D. SND.NXT ≥ MAXWND iv. (2 points) Which statement(s) are true? A. If TCP did not have fast retransmit, and a single packet loss occurred, the sliding window would cause TCP to block until the retransmission timeout. B. Selective acknowledgement narrows down which packets should be resent and thereby increases eﬃciency. C. The TCP mechanism of communicating receiver window sizes is called ﬂow con- trol. Its goal is to not overwhelm the sender. Page 11 (d) (4 points) TCP Retransmission Timeout (RTO). TCP samples the RTT by tracking when it sent out packets and when they were acknowledged. The Karn/Partridge algorithm uses the following function to estimate RTT: EstimatedRTT = α × EstimatedRTT + (1 − α) × SampleRTT with 0 < α ≤ 1 . i. (2 points) Which statement(s) are true? A. Setting a too-short RTO leads to excessive retransmissions, in particular if RTO < RTT, and as such results in ineﬃciency. B. Setting a too-long RTO leads to excessive waiting times to resume transmission, and as such results in ineﬃciency. C. When multiplied with the speed of light through ﬁber, any RTT sample provides an upper bound on the physical distance between the source and destination. ii. (1 point) The Karn/Partridge algorithm uses... A. ...weighted linear averaging. B. ...exponential averaging. iii. (1 point) Increasing α makes the RTT estimation ....... sensitive to newer RTT samples. A. more B. less Page 12 (e) (8 points) QUIC vs. TCP. Consider a client and a server wanting to connect to each other. Assert that the client already knows the server’s IP address. Assume that the TLS handshake takes 1 RTT if the client and server have not connected before (recently). Also assume that the only data the client sends to the server is an idempotent HTTP GET request. i. (2 points) For a TCP+TLS connection, how many RTTs would it take before the client can start sending data when they have not connected before (recently)? Brieﬂy explain why. ii. (1 point) For a QUIC connection, how many RTTs would it take before the client can start sending data when they have not connected before (recently)? Brieﬂy explain why. iii. (1 point) ... and for QUIC when they have already connected before (recently) and 0-RTT is enabled? Brieﬂy explain why. iv. (4 points) Which statement(s) are true? A. QUIC is built on top of UDP B. QUIC incorporates the TLS handshake in its own transport layer handshake, whereas TCP is oblivious to it. C. The QUIC protocol is fully backward compatible with TCP. D. TCP uses connection IDs to distinguish between connections, which are indepen- dent of IP addresses. E. To prevent head-of-line blocking, QUIC permits multiple streams, in contrast to TCP. F. Middleboxes can potentially read and modify the whole TCP header. G. TCP enforces the end-to-end principle more strongly than QUIC. H. It is no longer needed to perform a separate DNS lookup beforehand when wanting to establish a QUIC connection to any host on the Internet. Page 13 4. Network Layer (30 points) (a) (9 points) IP subnets i. (7 points) Longest Preﬁx Matching. Reduce the number of entries in the following routing table as much as possible, without changing the routing behavior. (You may not need to use all spare lines of the solution table.) Preﬁx Outgoing Interface 3.2.0.0/20 enp1s0 3.3.0.0/16 enp2s0 3.2.16.0/20 enp1s0 3.2.64.0/24 enp2s0 3.2.192.128/25 enp2s0 3.2.0.0/16 enp2s0 default enp0s0 Preﬁx Outgoing Interface ii.

Consider now the network topology presented in Figure 6a, and assume that AS99 is authoritative for the preﬁx p. In this situation, AS99 announces preﬁx p to both AS7 and AS8. This announcement leads to the forwarding indicated by the arrows in the ﬁgure. Throughout the whole exercise, assume that the standard BGP forwarding rules according to business relationships apply. 1 2 3 4 5 6 87 99 provider customer traﬃc forwarding to preﬁx p (a) The initial topology and the given traﬃc forwarding rules to preﬁx p. 1 2 3 4 5 6 87 99 (b) First re-routing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 87 99 (c) Second re-routing (BGP poi- soning). Figure 6: The solid black arrows represent provider ← customer relationships. i. (1 point) Considering the traﬃc patterns of Figure 6a, what BGP announcement did AS2 send to AS1? ii. (2 points) The network operator of AS99 wants to force the traﬃc for preﬁx p from AS5 to go through AS7 instead of AS8, as in Figure 6b. How can the operator achieve this by manipulating its BGP announcement(s) without using path prepending and poisoning / loop prevention? iii. (2 points) What is the disadvantage of this approach? iv. (2 points) What is the path that traﬃc from AS8 to preﬁx p will take now? Write down the path only, in the form {AS8, ASx, . . . , AS99}. v. (2 points) Now, the operator of AS99 wants the traﬃc from AS2 to preﬁx p to be forwarded on the link between AS5 and AS7, while maintaining the re-routing of sub-question (i) (as in Figure 6c). What is the announcement AS99 has to transmit to achieve this using path prepending and poisoning / loop prevention? Write down the announcement only, in the form {IP preﬁx, {ASx, ASy, . . . }}. vi. (2 points) What is the result these actions combined? In particular, write down the AS numbers of the ASes which are now reaching preﬁx p through the link AS5–AS7. Page 15 vii. (2 points) Compare the number of ASes that were sending on the link before and after the poisoning. Brieﬂy comment on why this could be a problem for the Internet infrastructure. You see, in this question you discovered the “Maestro” attack on BGP. You are now a network- security researcher! Page 16 (c) (8 points) SCION and BGP. Consider the topology in Figure 7. CORE 2 3 1 5 4 Figure 7: AS topology with relationship annotations. The dashed line represents a peering link, while the arrows represent provider ← customer relationships. i. (2 points) The core issues a beacon for each of its interfaces. The beacon is propagated according to the following rule: each AS propagates and registers only the single path with the smallest number of AS hops (assume that an AS receives all the beacons it has to receive simultaneously). Which beacons do AS1 and AS5 register? You can ignore peering entries. Write down the beacons as sequences of AS numbers: {AS-core, ASx, . . . }. ii. (2 points) A host in AS1 wants to communicate to another host in AS5. What are the paths at the disposal of the source, given the paths previously registered which include potential peering links? Write down the paths as ordered lists of ASes: {ASx, . . . , ASy}. iii. (2 points) Think now of BGP routing on the same topology. What would be the path selected by BGP from AS1 to AS5. Write down the paths as ordered lists of ASes: {ASx, . . . , ASy}. iv. (2 points) Compare the paths obtained by SCION and by BGP. List one possible advantage and one disadvantage that SCION forwarding has over BGP forwarding. Page 17 5. The Link Layer (25 points) (a) (9 points) CSMA/CA. Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a protocol used to communicate between wireless nodes. You are given 4 wireless nodes (A-D) all running a simpliﬁed version of CSMA/CA as presented in the lecture with the following assumptions. Each data frame takes 100 µs to transmit, and each ACK frame, Request-To-Send (RTS) frame, and Clear-To-Send (CTS) frame takes 10 µs to transmit (all times include propagation times). The RTS frame always reserves the channel for 120 µs in order to transmit the CTS, data, and ACK frame and the CTS frame always reserves the channel for 110 µs in order to transmit the data and ACK frame. A wireless node can either send or listen but not do both at the same time. Instead of using random backoﬀ times that exponentially increase with each collision, we use a constant backoﬀ time of 20 µs. In CSMA/CA, the nodes wait for the backoﬀ time before sending the RTS frame even if the channel is free to send. The wireless nodes can immediately detect if another node in range is sending traﬃc, there is no processing time for packets, and nodes can immediately switch between sending to transmitting.1 All messages are transmitted correctly, which means no messages are lost or corrupted during the transmission. The nodes create data packets and pass them to the link layer to be sent to other nodes at the following times: • A → B at 0 µs • C → D at 100 µs • B → A at 160 µs • D → C at 280 µs i. (5 points) Given that the nodes are all within transmission range of each other, ﬁll out the end time of the transmission in the following table. A transmission from A to B is considered to end at time t if A receives the last bit of the ACK frame sent from B after receiving the DATA frame. You can use the timeline in Figure 8 to illustrate the behavior, but the grading is done purely based on the table. The timelines show all actions performed by the nodes A and B before 150 µs and the four times when nodes attempt to send. Source Destination Attempting to send at Finished at A B 0 µs 150 µs C D 100 µs B A 160 µs D C 280 µs ii. (2 points) Given the network allocation vectors in Figure 9, and if all nodes form a con- nected graph, what is the topology of nodes A–D? For each node, specify which other nodes are within transmission range: A: B: C: D: iii. (2 points) Why is RTS/CTS used? Explain how C would behave and what complications there would be in our example after 100 µs, if RTS/CTS was not used. 1Other interframe waiting times used in CSMA/CA such as DCF Interframe Space (DIFS), Short Interframe Space (SIFS), and Point coordination Interframe Space (PIFS) are not used and can be ignored (if you do not know these terms, you should ignore this sentence).
