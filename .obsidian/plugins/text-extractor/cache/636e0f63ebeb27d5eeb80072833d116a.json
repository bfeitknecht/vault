Since the relation is symmetric, the graph is undirected. Then the game is winnable if and only if, there exists a hamilton path starting from every vertex v ∈ V . Speciﬁcally, if there exists a vertex w ∈ V such that there is no hamilton path starting from w, the game is not winnable since this player can't get the message to all the others. □ (b) Observe the following counterexample. a b c For a, c ∈ V the game is winnable, since there exists a hamilton path, namely (a, b, c) and (c, b, a). However, starting from b ∈ V there is no hamilton path and thus the game is not winnable. □ (c) In terms of our graph model, the stated conditions translate to the following. The following counterexample fulﬁlls the requirements stated above and illustrates that the claim is false for n = 5, since starting from any vertex v ∈ V − {c} the game is winnable, however starting from c it isn't. a b c d e □ ∀v ∈ V : deg(v) ≤ 2, every vertex has degree at least two ∀a, b ∈ V : ∃P = (a, … , b), any two vertices are reachable from each other 8.5   Short Questions about Graphs In the following, let G = (V , E) be a graph with n = |V | and m = |E|. For statements (b) - (f), decide if the statement is true or false. If it's true, provide a proof, else provide a counterexample. (a) True. Assume for contradiction that there exists two paths P1, P2 that start at v and end at w such that P1 ≠ P2. Then we observe the following case distinction on the two paths. Paths are disjoint, P1 ∩ P2 = ∅ Without loss of generality, traverse one of the paths in reverse order, starting from w to v. Then this forms a cycle. Paths are not disjoint, P1 ∩ P2 ≠ ∅ Let x ∈ P1 ∩ P2 be the vertex where the two paths meet. Without loss of generality, continue the traversal of one path to w and follow the other in reverse order back to x. This is a cycle. Contradiction. The existence of two distinct paths from w to v introduces a cycle but the graph G is a tree, which cannot contain cycles. Thus the statement is proven. □ (b) True. Assume ∀v ∈ V : deg(v) ≥ ⌈ n 2 ⌉. Then, for any two arbitrary vertices u, v ∈ V , with u ≠ v we have either {u, v} ∈ E or N(u) ∩ N(v) ≠ ∅, where N denotes the set of all adjacent vertices. Thus there exists a walk of length 2 with starting vertex u and ending vertex v. Hence, any arbitrary two distinct vertices are in the same connected component. It follows that G is connected. □ (c) False. Consider the graph below. We have two hamilton cycles C, C ′ with C ∩ C ′ = ∅. Speciﬁcally, red indicates one hamilton cycle and blue indicates another. They share no edges, thus the statement is disproven. □ (d) True. Since there are n vertices, there are n − 1 possible degrees. This is due to the fact that any vertex w ∈ V can at most be connected to all other vertices besides itself, i.e. w ′ ∈ V − {w}. On the other side, a vertex of degree zero w ′′ ∈ V ′, deg(w ′′) = 0 is not connected to any other vertices so the maximum degree is n − 1 , i.e. the maximum degree from before deg(w) = n − 1 minus one, since w is not connected to w ′′ plus one since there is an additional distinct vertex in V ′, namely the one with degree zero w′′. Per pigeonhole principle we have ⌈ n n−1 ⌉ = 2 which implies that there must be u, v ∈ V such that deg(u) = deg(v). Thus the statement is proven. □ (e) False. Consider the following counter example. G is a graph that, for every path P of length at least |P | ≥ 2, the sum of degree of vertices in the path is even ∑vi∈P deg(vi) ≡ 2 0. However, G does not have an eulerian walk. a b c d e □ (f) False. Observe the graph given below. a b c d e Speciﬁcally, deleting any edge e ∈ E leaves the graph connected, however deleting the vertex c disconnects the graph. Thus the statement is disproven. □ − 1 + 1","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
