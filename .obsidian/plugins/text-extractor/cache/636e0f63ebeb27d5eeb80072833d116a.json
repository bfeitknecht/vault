For statements (b) - (f), decide if the statement is true or false. If it's true, provide a proof, else provide a counterexample. (a) (b) True. Assume ∀v ∈ V : deg(v) ≥ ⌈ n 2 ⌉. Then, for any two arbitrary vertices u, v ∈ V , with u ≠ v we have either {u, v} ∈ E or N(u) ∩ N(v) ≠ ∅, where N denotes the set of all adjacent vertices. Thus there exists a walk of length 2 with starting vertex u and ending vertex v. Hence, any arbitrary two distinct vertices are in the same connected component. It follows that G is connected. □ (c) True. Assume for contradiction, that for a hamilton cycle C, there exists another hamilton cycle C ′ such that C ∩ C ′ = ∅. (d) False, consider the following counterexample. a b c We observe that deg(b) = 2 and ∃ ̸v ∈ V − {b} : deg(v) = 2. Thus the statement is disproven. □ (e) True. (f) False. Observe the graph given below. a b c d e Speciﬁcally, deleting any edge e ∈ E leaves the graph connected, however deleting the vertex e disconnects the graph. Thus the statement is disproven. □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
