Definition Let V be a vector space. Let G ⊆ V be a (possibly infinite) subset of vectors. A linear combination of G is a sum of the form ∑ v ∈F λv v , where F ⊆ G is a finite subset of G and λv ∈ R for all v ∈ F . Lemma Let V be a vector space. Let G ⊆ V . Every linear combination of G is again an element in V . Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 2 / 10 Linear combinations Proof of the lemma ”Every linear combination of G ⊆ V is again an element in V .” Let F = {v1, . . . , vn} ⊆ G be a finite subset of G. Consider the linear combination n ∑ j=1 λj vj . By definition of a vector space, wj := λj vj ∈ V for all j = 1, . . . , n. Accordingly, w1 + w2 ∈ V . Use an inductive argument: If w := w1 + . . . + wj−1 ∈ V then, w1 + w2 + · · · + wj−1 + wj = w + wj ∈ V . Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 3 / 10 The concept of a basis Why not infinite linear combinations? The previous lemma may fail. Let V be the vector space of polynomials with real coefficients in one variable x. Then 1, x, x 2, x 3, . . . ∈ V , but ∞ ∑ i=0 x i = 1 1 − x ̸∈ V . Definition Let V be a vector space. Let G ⊆ V be a subset of elements in V . Span(G) = { ∑ v ∈F λv v | λv ∈ R for all v ∈ F , F ⊆ G finite}. G is linearly independent if no vector v ∈ G is a linear combination of G \\ {v }. G is linearly dependent if there exists a vector w ∈ G that is a linear combination of G \\ {w}. B ⊆ V is a basis of V if B is linearly independent and Span(B) = V . Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 4 / 10 Two observations Let V be a vect. sp. G ⊆ V is linearly independent if and only if for all F ⊆ G, F finite, ∑v ∈F λv v = 0 implies λv = 0 for all v ∈ F . Suppose F is finite and ∑v ∈F λv v = 0 where λw ̸= 0 for w ∈ F . Then λw w = − ∑v ∈F \\{w} λv v ⇐⇒ w = −1 λw ∑v ∈F \\{w} λv v and hence, w ∈ G is a linear combination of G \\ {w}. Conversely, if w = ∑v ∈F λv v where F ⊆ G finite and w ∈ G, then we obtain 0 = ∑v ∈F λv v − 1 · w. Every set B of m linearly ind. vectors in Rm is a basis of Rm. Let B = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}. We need to show that Span(B) = Rm! Define the matrix A ∈ Rm×m with columns v1, v2, . . . , vm. From Theorem 3.11 it follows that for every v ∈ Rm, Ax = v has a unique solution x ∈ Rm and hence, v = m ∑ j=1 xj vj Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 5 / 10 Steinitz exchange lemma Lemma. Let V be a vector space, F ⊆ V finite and linearly independent, G ⊆ V finite with Span(G) = V . Then (i) |F | ≤ |G|. (ii) There exists a subset E ⊆ G of size |G| − |F | such that Span(F ∪ E) = V . Proof by induction on f = |F |. if f = 0, then F = /0. Hence, (i) is clear and for (ii), take E = G. Let f > 0. Suppose the statement is correct for all numbers smaller than f . Choose u ∈ F , F ′ = F \\ {u}, g = |G|. From the induction hypothesis applied to F ′ we have (i) g ≥ f − 1. (ii) There exists a subset E ′ ⊆ G of size g − (f − 1) with Span(F ′ ∪ E ′) = V . Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 6 / 10 Proof of the Steinitz exchange lemma continued u ∈ Span(F ′ ∪ E ′). Since F is lin. ind., u ̸∈ Span(F ′). This gives u = ∑ v ∈F ′∪E ′ λv v , where λw ̸= 0 for some w ∈ E ′. Hence |E ′| = g − (f − 1) ≥ 1 ⇐⇒ g ≥ f and we showed statement (i). To show (ii), let E := E ′ \\ {w}. We have F ′ = F \\ {u} and span(F ′ ∪ E ′) = V . u is a linear combination of F ′ ∪ E ′ = F ′ ∪ E ∪ {w}, u = ∑ v ∈F ′∪E λv v + λw w ⇐⇒ w = 1 λw (u − ∑ v ∈F ′∪E λv v ). Hence w is a linear combination of {u} ∪ F ′ ∪ E = F ∪ E. This gives Span(F ∪ E) = Span({u} ∪ F ′ ∪ E). Span({u} ∪ F ′ ∪ E) = Span({u} ∪ {w} ∪ F ′ ∪ E) = Span({u} ∪ F ′ ∪ E ′) = V . Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 7 / 10 Finitely generated vector spaces I Definition A vector space V is called finitely generated if there exists a finite subset G ⊆ V with Span(G) = V . Rm is finitely generated, whereas R[x] is not Theorem 4.22 Let V be a finitely generated vector space, let G ⊆ V be a finite subset of V with Span(G) = V . Then V has a basis B ⊆ G. Proof. If G is linearly independent, then B = G is a basis by definition. Otherwise, there exists v ∈ G that is a linear combination of the other vectors. We have that Span(G \\ {v }) = Span(G) = V . Replace G with G \\ {v } and iterate. Since V is finitely generated this process finally stops with B = G. Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 8 / 10 Finitely generated vector spaces II Theorem 4.20 Let V be a finitely generated vector space. Let B, B′ ⊆ V be two finite bases of V . Then, |B| = |B′|. Proof. Bases B and B′ are linearly independent and Span(B) = Span(B′) = V . Apply Steinitz exchange lemma (i): F = B, G = B′ ⇒ |B| ≤ |B′|. F = B′, G = B ⇒ |B′| ≤ |B|. Theorem 4.20 and Theorem 4.22 Let V be a finitely generated vector space. V has a finite basis B ⊆ V and whenever B, B′ ⊆ V are two finite bases of V , then |B| = |B′|. Robert Weismantel October 24, 2024 9 / 10 Dimension of a vector space Definition Let V be a finitely generated vector space. Then dim(V ), the dimension of V , is the size of any basis B of V . (Note that dim(Rm) = m) Lemma 4.24 Let V be a vector space of dimension d. (i) Let F ⊆ V be a set of d linearly independent vectors. F is a basis of V . (ii) Let G ⊆ V be a set of d vectors with Span(G) = V . G is a basis of V . Proof. Let G be a basis of V . Steinitz exchange Lemma applies with F and G. |F | = |G| = d ⇒ E = /0. Span(F ) = Span(F ∪ E) = V ⇒ F is a basis. From Thm 4.22, there exists a basis B ⊆ G of size d, i.e., |B| = |G|. ⇒ B = G ⇒ G is a basis.
