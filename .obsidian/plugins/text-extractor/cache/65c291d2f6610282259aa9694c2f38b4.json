{"path":"var/export/LinAlg-bf-u04.pdf","text":"2. Per theorem 3.11, the statement that A is invertible is equivalent to the statement that A has linearly independent column vectors. A matrix has linearly independent column vectors, if its determinant is non-zero, which is given for a ≠ 0 , since det(A) = a. The inverse of an invertible matrix is given by its adjugate matrix scaled by the reciprocal of its determinant, which is evaluated below. First, we construct the cofactor matrix C. Then, we ﬁnd the adjugate matrix, which is equal to the cofactor‘s matrix transpose, adj(A) = C ⊤ and multiply it with the scalar 1 det(A) . Thus we have constructed the inverse matrix A− 1 of A. □ C = = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ C11 C12 C13 C21 C22 C23 C31 C32 C33 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ 1 0 0 − b a 0 bd − c − ad a ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ A− 1 = 1 det(A) ⋅ adj(A) (def. det and adj) = 1 a ⋅ (scalar multiplication) = ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ 1 − b bd − c 0 a − ad 0 0 a ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ 1 a − b a bd− c a 0 1 − d 0 0 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
