Since the function tables for A♡B and B ♡A are not the same, A♡B ≢ B ♡A, i.e. the ♡ operator is not commutative. □ ii) Now, we cover the ♢ operator. Since the function tables for A♢B and B ♢A are the same, A♢B ≡ B ♢A, i.e. the ♢ operator is commutative. □ “DMath-bf-u01-19AD9AF9698CB87E5EDA7F248D0BC34C.pdf#page=2&rect=76,348,414,453” could not be found. “DMath-bf-u01-19AD9AF9698CB87E5EDA7F248D0BC34C.pdf#page=2&rect=107,271,414,340” could not be found.

To make our life easier, we decompose the logical formulae into their components. First, let's cover F . Then, we will go over F as a whole. Now that we have that, we need to look at G. Then, we'll go over it as a whole.
