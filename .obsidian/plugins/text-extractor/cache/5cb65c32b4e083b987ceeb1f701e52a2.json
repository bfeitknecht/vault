(a) (4 points) For the following four numbers given in decimal or hexadecimal notation, write the corresponding binary number using the indicated format. (\u000011)10 using 6-bit two’s complement: (11 0101)2 (51)10 using 6-bit unsigned: (11 0011)2 (\u000017)10 using 6-bit sign magnitude: (11 0001)2 (39)16 using 6-bit unsigned: (11 1001)2 (b) (1 point) What are the problems with the sign/magnitude representation of binary numbers, why are they not used more often than two’s complement representation? Solution: Zero is represented twice (+0, -0), and more importantly subtraction is more complex when you have sign/magnitude. In two’s complement the same circuit can handle both positive and negative numbers exactly the same way. Second Session Exam Page 2 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 2.

Solution: For the solution given in Question 2d, the critical path goes through 1 AND gate and 3 OR gates = 4 propagation delays = 400ps. The shortest path goes through one AND gate and two OR gates = 3 contami- nation delays = 150ps. (f) (5 points) Note that the function T contains E (meaning T is ’1’ for every input that results in a ’1’ for E). Assume that you already have a small circuit that implements E,design a simpler Boolean function that implements T by using the output of E and draw the gate level schematic once again only using E,2-input AND/OR gates and inverters.

In this question you will be given the state transition diagram for a Finite State Machine (FSM). The FSM has a two-bit output \"out[1:0]\"aswell asasinglebit input \"in\". init reset in=0/ out=00 zero onetwo mid in=0/ out=00 in=0/ out=00 in=0/ out=00 in=1/ out=11 in=1/ out=11 in=1/ out=11 in=1/ out=01 in=0/ out=01 in=1/ out=10 (a) (2 points) Is this a Mealy or Moore type of FSM, brieﬂy explain why? Solution: This is a Mealy type of FSM, as the output depends not only on the state but also on the present value of the input.

Solution: This is one possible solution. Note that states ZeroA and ZeroB can be merged, however this organization is slightly more regular, and shows the thinking behind the original FSM. init \"00\" reset mid \"01\" zeroA \"00\" two \"11\" oneA \"01\" oneB \"10\" zeroB \"00\" in=0in=1 in=1 in=1 in=1 in=1 in=1 in=1 in=0 in=0 in=0 in=0 in=0 in=0 Second Session Exam Page 8 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 4. (10 points) There are four Verilog code snippets in this section. For each code, ﬁrst state whether or not there is a mistake. If there is a mistake explain how to correct it. Note: Assume that the behavior as described, is correct (a) 1 module mux2 ( input [1:0] i, output s, input z); 2 assign s= (z) ? i[1]:i[0]; 3 endmodule 4 5 module one (input [3:0] data, input sel1, input sel2, output z ); 6 wire [1:0] temp ; 7 8 mux2 i0 (data[1:0], sel1, temp[0]); 9 mux2 i1 (data[3:2], sel1, temp[1]); 10 mux2 final (temp, sel2, z); 11 endmodule Solution: This code is not correct. It uses an ordered instantiation template where the ordering of the pins should correspond to the order they are declared. This itself is not wrong, but the input signals on the second position (sel1,sel2) connect to the output of the instance mux. Either the ordering of mux2 needs to be changed, or the ordering of the elements the instantiation. The better option would be to use a connect by name. (b) 1 module two (input [3:0] a, input [0:3] b, output reg [3:0] z); 2 always @( *) 3 if (a == 0) 4 z={b[0],b[1],b[2],b[3]}; 5 else 6 z=a+b; 7 endmodule Solution: The code is syntactically correct. There is a lot of unnecessary code: using one input as [0:3] and the other as [3:0] is not the smartest choice, the entire code could be written as assign z=a+b,but syntacticallythecode iscorrect. Second Session Exam Page 9 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 (c) 1 module three (clk, rst, a, b, c, z); 2 input a,b,c,clk,rst; 3 output reg z; 4 reg q; 5 6 always @(*) 7 begin 8 q <= a ^ b; 9 if (c) q <= ~(a^b); 10 end 11 always @(negedge clk) 12 if (rst) z= 1’b0; 13 else z= q; 14 endmodule Solution: The code is syntactically correct. Once again, it is a bit unconventional. One always block use blocking statements and the other non-blocking statements. Both would work, although it would probably be more eﬃcient to write them other- wise. (d) 1 module four (input [2:0] sel, output reg [5:0] z); 2 case (sel) 3 0: z = 6’b00_0000; 4 1: z = 6’b00_0001; 5 2: z = 6’b00_0011; 6 3: z = 6’b00_0111; 7 4: z = 6’b00_1111; 8 5: z = 6’b01_1111; 9 6: z = 6’b11_1111; 10 default: z= 6’b00_0000; 11 endcase 12 endmodule Solution: This code is not correct. The case statement is a sequential statement that needs to be within an always statement. Second Session Exam Page 10 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 For the following questions 5 and 6 we will attempt to add a simple peripheral to a standard single cycle MIPS processor. In question 5 you will make the modiﬁcations to the hardware and in question 6 you will write MIPS code to help you access this peripheral. Note that, you can answer the questions independently. i.e. it is possible to answer 6 even if you have not answered 5. The peripheral we want to add is a simple Analog to Digital converter (ADC) as shown below. Clk DataOut[7:0] Start Done AnalogIn Analog Digital Converter Clk DataOut[7:0] Done Start Conversion is taking place Value Ready • The ADC has to be initiated by setting the Start signal to ’1’. • The ADC will then start converting the AnalogIn signal into a digital value. This could take several clock cycles to ﬁnish. You do not need to know in advance exactly how many clock cycles the conversion will require. • As soon as the conversion is done, the ADC will pull the Done signal to ’1’. • At this point the analog input has been converted to an 8-bit value that will be available as the DataOut signal and can safely be read back. • The DataOut will stay valid as long as the Start signal is 1. Once you have recovered the data, you can complete the action by resetting the Start signal back to ’0’. • As soon as you reset the Start signal the ADC will also lower the Done signal back to ’0’ and the ADC will be ready to make another conversion.

In this question, we will write subroutines to access the ADC we have added to our MIPS system. As before, the three pins are mapped to the following addresses: Start 0xFFFF FF00 Done 0xFFFF FF40 DataOut 0xFFFF FF80 (a) (5 points) Write a subroutine called readADC that will 1. Activate the ADC 2. Wait until the conversion is over 3. Read the Value converted by the ADC and return it to the calling program. Solution: 1 readADC: addi $t1, $0, 1 # We need ’1’ in one register 2 # Optionally check if ’Done’=0 3 sw $t1, 0xff00($0) # Activate ADC by writing ’1’ to ’Start’ 4 waitloop: lw $t2, 0xff40($0) # Read ’Done’ 5 beq $t2, $0, waitloop # if ’Done’= 0 keep waiting 6 lw $v0, 0xff80($0) # Read the ’DataOut’ 7 sw $0, 0xff00($0) # Set ’Start’ back to 0 8 jr $ra # Return to $ra Second Session Exam Page 15 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 (b) (5 points) Now write a function averageADC that will collect 256 values from the ADC by calling the subroutine you have written above. Average these 256 values and return the result back to a calling subroutine. Solution: 1 averageADC : addi $s0, $0, 0 # this will be our count 2 addi $sp, $sp, -4 # make room on stack 3 sw $ra, 0($sp) # push the return address 4 addi $s2, $0, 256 # end count for the loop 5 loop : jal readADC # call subroutine we have written 6 add $s0, $v0, $s0 # accumulate values in $s0 7 addi $s2, $s2, -1 # reduce count 8 beq $s2, $0, fin # jump to loop end 9 j loop 10 fin : sra $v0, $s0, 8 # divide by 256 for averaging 11 lw $ra, 0($sp) # read back the return address 12 addi $sp, $sp, 4 # restore stackpointer 13 jr $ra # return to $ra Second Session Exam Page 16 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 7. For this question consider the following MIPS assembly code. 1 lui $s0, 0x2000 # Initialize addresses 2 ori $s0, 0x0000 # First vector 3 lui $s1, 0x1001 4 ori $s1, 0x5000 # Second vector 5 lui $s2, 0x1001 6 ori $s2, 0x6000 # End address 7 addi $s3, $0, 0 # initialize 8 loop: lw $t0, 0($s0) # Read vector 1 9 lw $t1, 0($s1) # Read vector 2 10 add $t2, $t0, $t1 # Add both to $t2 11 add $s3, $s3, $t2 # Accumulate at $s3 12 addi $s0, $s0, 4 # increment vector 1 13 addi $s1, $s1, 4 # increment vector 2 14 beq $s1, $s2, end # end reached? 15 j loop # no, loop. 16 end: This code is being executed on a MIPS processor that executes all instructions in a single cycle, except for memory accesses (i.e. lw and sw instructions) which take 20 clock cycles. The processor will be waiting during this time. In the actual exam, there was a mistake in the assembly code where the ad- dresses were initialized. The question was still solvable, but the calculations were a bit awkward. Due to this mistake, no students lost points from this question. This is the way the question was intended. (a) (2 points) How many clock cycles (approximately) does it take to execute the above mentioned program? Solution: There are 7 instructions before the loop. The loop is executed 1024 times. There are 6 instructions that take 1 clock cycle and 2 lw instructions that take 20 cycles so the total is: Total = 7 + 1024 * (2*20 + 6) = 47111 ~ 45000 - 50000 cycles Second Session Exam Page 17 of 18 Design of Digital Circuits 10th of February 2016 (b) (4 points) We want to speed up the operation by using a cache memory. By using a cache with a capacity of 256 words, we can achieve 1 clock cycle memory accesses for data that is within the cache. How fast would the above program execute if a direct mapped cache with block size of one word is used? Solution: In principle, all memory accesses would be cache misses, no data is read twice (no temporal locality), and block size is one word so no spatial locality can be exploited. In fact each lw instruction will be longer, as now we have one cycle for the cache miss (21 instead of 20 cycles). Total = 7 + 1024 * (2*21 + 6) = 49159 ~ 50000 cycles (c) (4 points) What would be the best possible cache conﬁguration with a capacity of 256 words for running this program? Solution: There are two independent memory locations being read. So the cache needs to be 2-way set associative so that the consecutive lw accesses on $s0 and $s1 do not invalidate the data. Since there is no temporal locality (data is not read again in this program), spatial locality is the only way to speed up. The block size should be as large as possible. Since we have 2-ways, the largest block size we can have is 128 words. In this case we would have 2 cache misses for each way every 128 memory accesses that will require 21 cycles each. All other accesses will have a single cycle access time. Total = 7 + 8 * (2 * 21 +6) + 1016 * 8 = 8519 ~ 8000-9000 cycles Second Session Exam Page 18 of 18","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
