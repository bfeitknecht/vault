Then, F1 = T1 − {e1} is the forest resulting from removing the edge e1, where F1 = X1 ∪ Y1 are its two connected components. As T2 is a spanning tree, there must exist an edge e2 = {x2, y2} ∈ T2 between the two connected components X1, Y1. Together, these cover all edges in T1, therefore the edge cannot belong to T1, i.e. e2 ∈ T2 − T1. Thus T ′ 1 = F1 ∪ {e2} is connected and hence a spanning tree. Now consider F2 = T2 − {e2}. As T1 is spanning tree and all edges in F2 belong to T2, the edge e1 restores connectivity of the two components F2 = X2 ∪ Y2 and thus T ′ 2 = F2 ∪ {e1} is a spanning tree. □ (b) Assume that H is disconnected and consists of k connected components, i.e. H = ⨁i∈[k]Hi. Then, let T1 ∈ EH1 and T2 ∈ EH2 be two vertices of arbitrary distinct connected components H1, H2. By deﬁnition of H, T1, T2 are spanning trees. As G is connected and thus the spanning trees T1, T2 are also connected, we can construct spanning trees T ′ 1, T ′ 2 by the symmetric basis exchange property. These diﬀer from T1, T2 by exactly two edges respectively. Continued application of the exchange property leads to spanning trees T ∗ 1 = T ∗ 2 . As these are identical, there exists a sequence of transformations by symmetric basis exchange such that T1 ↭ T2 are connected through spanning trees diﬀering by exactly two edges. Contradiction. As the two vertices were chosen arbitrarily, it follows that H is connected. □ (c) Assume that HMST ⊆ H is disconnected and consists of k connected components H = ⨁i∈[k]Hi. Then, let T1 ∈ EH1 and T2 ∈ EH2 be two vertices of arbitrary distinct connected components H1, H2. By deﬁnition of HMST, T1, T2 are MST, i.e. w′(T1) = w′(T2), where w′ : E ∗ → R≥ 0. Then there exists a sequence of transformations by symmetric basis exchange such that T1 ↭ T2, as edges of equal weight w(e1) = w(e′ 1) can continually be swapped until T ∗ 1 = T ∗ 2 . Contradiction. Since the vertices T1, T2 were chosen arbitrarily, the initial assumption that HMST is disconnected must be false and hence HMST is connected. □ 12.5 Heavy and Light Edges (a) Assume for contradiction that T ⊆ E is an MST which contains a heavy edge e. Then there exists a cycle C ⊆ E such that ∀e′ ∈ C − {e} : we > we′. Now construct G′ = T ∪ {e′}, with e′ ∈ C. As T is MST, this introduces a cycle C ′ ⊆ G′. Finally, removing the heavy edge e leads to a spanning tree T ′ = G′ − {e}. As e is a heavy edge, the new spanning tree's weight is strictly less than that of the assumed MST with w′(T ′) < w′(T ). Contradiction. Hence, the initial assumption must be false and it's proven that a heavy edge cannot be light. □","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
