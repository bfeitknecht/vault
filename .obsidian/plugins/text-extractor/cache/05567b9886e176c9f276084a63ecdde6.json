L1 = {w ∈ {0, 1}∗ | w = x0y0z such that x, z ∈ {0, 1} ∗ and y ∈ {0, 1}2}. (b) Prove that every (deterministic) finite automaton accepting the language L2 = {w ∈ {a, b}∗ | |w|b ≡ 1 (mod 3) and w starts with ab} has at least 6 states. 5+10 points Task 15 On the Moodle platform, there is a video available for you that demonstrates the power set construction for converting an NFA to an FA in detail with an example. You have the opportunity to watch this video and then work through another example in person during the next tutorial session. There are no points or model solutions for this in-person task, but you can discuss the example in detail during the tutorial. 0 points Submission: On Friday, October 25, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
