True False A stub resolver contacts the root name servers to resolve addresses The record that maps the web address www.ethz.ch to a website ethz.ch is a CNAME record TTL speciﬁed in DNS records are in ms A glue record is used to get the IP address of the A record data dig ch. NSWeb and HTTP Below you are given a time annotated dependency graph (in ms) of the tasks processed when a website page is loaded like the ones you have seen in the lectures. The nodes represent the tasks that are processed and the edges (E_0 to E_9) are annotated with the processing time of the preceding task in ms. For example, Task B depends on Task A and the processing time for Task A is 20ms.  Question 7 (1.0 point)  Calculate the ﬁnal overall page-load time. No explanation is required, only the ﬁnal answer is needed (i.e. “..... ms”) Question 8 (1.0 point) Assume that in a browser all resources are loaded before the browser starts processing the tasks. In which order would the browser process the tasks in the dependency graph? Enter a comma-separated list without spaces in the ﬁeld below without a comma at the end of the list. For example: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,FIN  Question 9 (1.0 point) For the previous question (Question 8), what algorithm did you use to decide the order of the tasks? Can the browser execute the tasks in any other order?  Question 10 (5.0 points) You analyse the tasks in the dependency graph and ﬁnd that you can perform the following optimizations: O1 : Modify Task D such that it does not depend on any other Task O2 : Reduce the processing time of Task C to 20ms O3 : Change Task G such that it does not have to wait for Task E to be processed.  For each of the optimizations (O1, O2 and O3) state how the dependency graph will change if they are applied individually i.e., which edges in the graph will change if each optimization is individually applied.  If you can only perform only ONE of the optimizations above to reduce the page-loading time, which would you choose and why? What is the new page load time (in ms) after the optimization you chose is applied?  Question 11 (2.0 points) Which of the following statements are True?  True False In the FQDN www.facebook.com, www is the hostname HTTP/3 runs over TCP A forward proxy is a server that caches documents close to clients Server stores cookies to keep state in the HTTP protocol TCP Congestion Control Consider the following evolution of the congestion-window size of a TCP ﬂow (using the traditional Reno congestion-control algorithm).

You need to ﬁll out two tables regarding this ﬁgure: 1) the NAT table, and the second table, which represents the headers of the 8 packets exchanged between diﬀerent entities. You may need to use the information in some of the ﬁlled cells of each table to complete the tables. Note that the packet indices do not imply the temporal order of packets.

For example, the packet destined to 203.0.113.1 is forwarded using rule 1.

The forwarding table is repeated here for convenience:       Rule 5       Rule 4       Rule 3       Rule 2       Rule 1 IP Forwarding (2) Question 30 (4.0 points) In this question, consider a simple protocol called SPing, which implements the pinging functionality (i.e., checking whether a device is alive and measuring RTT). In SPing, the source host sends empty IP packets (i.e., a packet with an IP header and without payload) to a destination host at ﬁxed intervals and waits for an empty IP packet reply from the destination host. The source host can thus check whether the destination is (and remains) reachable and measure the round-trip time (RTT). Assume that packets experience no loss and the RTT is much lower than the interval duration. Question 30.1: Multiple Destinations (1 point) Can a source host correctly infer reachability and RTT of destination hosts when it simultaneously sends SPings to multiple destination hosts at diﬀerent IP addresses? Explain your reasoning. Question 30.2: Bi-directional SPings (1 point) Can a source host correctly infer reachability and RTT of a destination host when it simultaneously sends SPings to the destination host and the destination host sends SPings to the source host? Explain your reasoning. Question 30.3: Multiple SPings to single destination (1 point) Can a source host correctly infer reachability and RTT of a destination host when it simultaneously sends multiple SPings to the destination host? Explain your reasoning. Question 30.4: ICMP Ping (1 point) How are all of these problems of simultaneously sending (bi-directional) pings to one or multiple destinations solved in the ICMP ping protocol used in the Internet? Intra-Domain Routing Question 31 (3.0 points) In which of the following topologies would any of the nodes running a distance-vector protocol, such as RIP, experience the count-to-inﬁnity problem after the crossed out link fails (with and without using the poison reverse technique)? a) b) c) Count-to-inﬁnity Problem No count-to-inﬁnity Problem Topology (a) without poison reverse Topology (a) with poison reverse Topology (b) without poison reverse Topology (b) with poison reverse Topology (c) without poison reverse Topology (c) with poison reverse BGP The following paragraphs provide necessary information about BGP that you require to solve the following questions. Route selection A router prefers routes towards the same preﬁx based on: 1. Commercial relationships: routes received from customers are preferred to those received from peers and routes received from peers are preferred to those received from providers. 2. If two routes are equally preferred according to the ﬁrst criterion, the one with the shortest AS path is preferred. 3. In this exam we assume that if two routes are equally preferred according to the previous criteria, the one received earlier is preferred. (implementation tie breaker) Route propagation A router propagates BGP routes according to commercial relationships: 1. the announcement for a preﬁx coming from a customer is propagated to all customers, peers and providers; 2. the announcement for a preﬁx coming from a provider or a peer is only propagated to customers. MRAI timers In order to suppress the number of BGP update messages, BGP routers do not propagate every received announcement instantaneously. Instead, they wait for a Minimum Route Advertisement Interval and then propagate the best routes.  In this exam we assume per-peer MRAI timers, meaning that every router keeps a MRAI timer for each of its neighboring routers.  1. Whenever a router sends one or more update message(s) to each neighbor, it sets the timer for that neighbor.  2. Then, it waits until the MRAI timer is expired and will not propagate any update messages to that neighbor during this waiting interval. 3. When the MRAI timer is expired, all routes updated during the last MRAI are sent to the neighbor and the timer is set again. 4. If no route is updated during the last MRAI, the ﬁrst route getting updated after the MRAI expiration will be propagated immediately, and the time will be set again. 5. In this exam, all MRAI timers are set to 30 seconds. Processing delay Each router needs some time to process each received announcement, make routing decisions, and update its routing and forwarding tables accordingly. In this exam, each router can have either 1ms or 2 ms of processing delay per received update message. We specify the exact numbers on topologies. The following ﬁgure illustrates a topology of 6 ASes. Each dashed double arrow in this topology depicts a peering relationship between two neighboring ASes, and each solid arrow represents a customer-provider relationship, where the arrow points towards providers. Each AS has only one router. The MRAI timer of all routers in the topology is set to 30 seconds. The processing delay of each router is written in the ﬁgure below. Note that the processing delay of all routers is 1ms except for AS E which is 2ms.  Question 32 (1.0 point) If we deﬁne the convergence time as the time of the last routing table change in any router in the network, what is the convergence time of the network after the announcement of AS A. Question 33 (7.0 points) By preserving the temporal order, write all BGP update messages exchanged between ASes. To answer this question, you need to consider both the MRAI timers and the processing delays. You need to write your answers in the following format: Time: S s and M ms 1. From AS X to AS Y: path: 2. From AS Z to AS Q: path: Link Layer Question 34 (5.0 points) Consider a channel through which messages of length 250 bytes are transmitted repeatedly. Suppose that in this channel, bit- ﬂips happen with the following probability distributions:  Question 34.1: Hamming Code (1 point) How many check bits are needed in a Hamming Code to be strong enough to protect the integrity of a transmitted message in this channel? Question 34.2: Parity Bits (1 point)  How many parity bits are suﬃcient to detect the errors in this channel? Question 34.3: Error Recovery Strategy (3 points) According to previous parts, for a number of transmitted messages , and based on the value of , is it more appropriate (in terms of the expected number of total bits required to be transmitted to have a reliable data transmission) to do error detection or error correction? Explain the result. Question 35 (6.0 points) Now consider a diﬀerent channel with the same message length (250 bytes) as the previous one. Suppose that in this channel, bit-ﬂips happen with the following probability distributions:  Question 35.1: Hamming Code (1 point) Could Hamming code be used for error correction in this channel? What about error detection?  (If yes, how many check bits are required? If no, why?) Question 35.2: Reed-Solomon Codes (2 point) Reed–Solomon codes are a group of error-correcting codes with Hamming distance  for a bit message and bit block (block = message + check bits). How many check bits are needed in a Reed-Solomon Code to be strong enough to protect the integrity of a transmitted message in this channel? Question 35.3: Number of Check Bits (1 point): How many check bits are needed in a Reed-Solomon Code to detect the errors in this channel?  Question 35.4: Error Recovery Strategy (2 point): According to previous parts, for a number of transmitted messages , and based on the value of , is it more appropriate (in terms of the expected number of total bits required to be transmitted to have a reliable data transmission) to do error detection or error correction? f P (f = 1) = α P (f > 1) ≃ 0 M α f P (f <= 20) = β P (f > 20) ≃ 0 n  −  k  +1 k n M β Physical Layer Question 36 (5.0 points) Answer the following questions according to the Nyquist and Shannon limits: Shannon:  Nyquist: = bandwidth, = signal levels, = signal to noise ratio Question 36.1: Bit Transmission Rate (1 point) For a channel with ﬁxed bandwidth and negligible noise, what is a possible way to increase the bit transmission rate?

There exists an algorithm to solve the LP in time . n is smaller than m. n m O(n ⋅ log(n)) Satellite Networks A new startup wants to build a satellite constellation network to interconnect datacenters around the world. The idea is to deploy the datacenters in remote areas, with low precipitation rates and low population density, power them using renewables, and then use satellite connectivity to deliver low-latency services to the rest of the world. The satellites will have four 20 Gbps inter-satellite links each, and a 4 Gbps radio-frequency uplink/downlink. They ask you to consult on the constellation design.

Question 40.2: Improving Constellation Design (2 points) A market analysis shows that the distribution of the customers for your constellation will be concentrated across the latitudes -50° / +35°. Starting from this information, how would you change the constellation to improve on the disadvantages above? Explain your reasoning, and mention in particular the constellation type and the orbit inclination. Question 41 (4.0 points) Question 41.1: Minimum Elevation Angle (2 points) You have to select the minimum elevation angle (mesured from the point of view of the ground terminal, between the horizon and the position of the satellite) for the constellation. Mention one advantage and one disadvantage of a high minimum elevation angle. Question 41.2: Orbital Height (2 points) After having ﬁxed the minimum elevation angle, you have to select the orbit height for the constellation. Mention one andvantage and one disadvantage of a higher orbit compared to a lower one (think, for example, 2000 km compared to 500 km). Question 42 (2.0 points) Unfortunately, the developement of inter-satellite links was not fast enough, and therefore the ﬁrst constellation will not have inter-satellite links. What major obstacle does this pose to the viability of the \"datacenters in the desert\" proposal?
