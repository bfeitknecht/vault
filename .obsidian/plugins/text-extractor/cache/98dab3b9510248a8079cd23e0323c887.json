Using the deﬁnition (def. 2.4) of matrix-vector multiplication, we can also write the function T as a linear combination of column vectors in A, i.e. T (x) = ∑n+1 j=1 x′ jvj. ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 ⋮ xn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 ⋮ xn ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ We will prove that T : Rn → Rm is a linear transformation if and only if vn+1 = 0, by showing that the implication is true for both \"directions\". To begin, let's consider the if direction, i.e. the statement \"if the (n + 1)-th column vector of A is the zero vector, then T is a linear transformation\". To prove that T is a linear transformation, we need to show that it's closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. To do this, we will show that T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y) and T (λx) = λT (x) hold for arbitrary vectors x, y ∈ Rn and some scalar λ ∈ R. First, we'll cover linearity, i.e., T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y). Since T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y), linearity is proven. Let's now prove homogeneity, i.e. T (λx) = λT (x). Let λ ∈ R be some arbitrary scalar. Since, the function T preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication if vn+1 = 0, it is a linear transformation. Thus the ﬁrst direction of the implication is proven. □ T (x + y) = A (def. T ) = n+1 ∑ j=1 (x′ j + y′ j)vj (comm. scalar multiplication) = n+1 ∑ j=1 x′ jvj + n+1 ∑ j=1 y′ jvj (def. T ) = A + A = T (x) + T (y) □ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 + y1 ⋮ xn + yn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 ⋮ xn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ y1 ⋮ yn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ T (λx) = Aλ = A (def. scalar multiplication, def. T ) = n+1 ∑ j=1 λx′ jvj (comm. scalar multiplication) = λ n+1 ∑ j=1 x′ jvj (def. T ) = λA = λT (x) □ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 ⋮ xn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ λx1 ⋮ λxn λ ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ ⎡ ⎢ ⎣ x1 ⋮ xn 1 ⎤ ⎥ ⎦ Now we'll cover the other direction of the implication, namely the only if, i.e. \"if T is a linear transformation, then the (n + 1)-th column vector of A is the zero vector\". We prove this by contradiction. Let's assume that T is a linear transformation satisfying that T (0) = 0, but the last column vector is an arbitrary non-zero vector, i.e. vn+1 ≠ 0. Let's evaluate the function for the zero vector. We have arrived at a contradiction, since we assumed that the last column is an arbitrary non-z ero vector, which leads to a violation of the second axiom of a linear transformation. □ Thus we have proven that T is a linear transformation if and only if vn+1 = 0.
