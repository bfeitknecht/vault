E.g., 1 ton of methane has the same warming effect as about 84 tons of CO2 84 tons CO2eq [ Methane emissions ]  Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of all types of emissions and activities on global warming.  We often shorten further to just “carbon,” which is then used to refer to all GHGs. Carbon Units Dim. “There are different types of low-carbon energy sources. Clean energy Green energy Renewable energy does not produce carbon emissions comes from nature do not expire There is some overlap between those categories Classification is unformal and somewhat subjective Wind, solar Nuclear Hydropower E.g., comes from a source that Producing electricity emits carbon. ... Wait, what about solar, hydro, etc? [ GSF practioner course ] Producing electricity emits carbon. 60% of the world’s energy comes from carbon-intensive sources [ Rel. energy prod. | World ] Despite the uptake of low-carbon energy, the majority of the world’s electricity still comes from carbon-intensive sources. Producing electricity emits carbon. Switzerland is an outlier. Despite the uptake of low-carbon energy, the majority of the world’s electricity still comes from carbon-intensive sources. Electricity is quite clean in Switzerland, but hydropower cannot be scaled much further! [ Rel. energy prod. | CH ] What consumes energy in computer networks? Like for all (physical) products  All steps of the product life cycle from components extraction to recycling. During the use phase of the product  Routers, transceivers, optical amplifiers  The infrastructure needed to cool them! [ LCA ] It is important to distinguish operational and embodied carbon footprints Embodied carbon or “embedded carbon” refers to the carbon pollution resulting from the creation and disposal of a product. operational embodied For consumer devices, the embodied footprint dominates. [ GSF practioner course ] For networked devices, it tends to be the opposite Data from 2015 Networks Data centers User devices Embodied emissions Operational emissions [ Ericsson ICT report ] For networked devices, it tends to be the opposite because their operational footprint is huge! Data from 2015 Networks Data centers User devices Embodied emissions Operational emissions Not because better built or recycled Because the “use” phase consumes more in proportion It is also important to distinguish attributional and consequential reasoning. Attributional Consequential Are these my carbon emissions? What are the consequences of this activity in terms of carbon emissions? Attributional Consequential Are these my carbon emissions? What are the consequences of this activity in terms of carbon emissions? Attributional reasoning is about the allocation of the footprint to different parties.

Attributional reasoning is about the allocation of the footprint to different parties. Imagine 4 people driving on a trip to a meeting. We devide the emissions equally between among parties. Policy How much is allocated to each party? ¼ of the cost for driving one car. Attributional reasoning is about the allocation of the footprint to different parties. Now imagine a 5th person joins requiring a second car We devide the emissions equally between among parties. Policy Attributional reasoning is about the allocation of the footprint to different parties. Now imagine a 5th person joins requiring a second car We devide the emissions equally between among parties. Policy How much is allocated to each party? 2/5 of the cost for driving one car. Attributional Consequential Are these my carbon emissions? What are the consequences of this activity in terms of carbon emissions? Consequential reasoning is about weighting the impact of alternatives. Imagine five people driving to meeting, requiring a two cars. We need the second car as a consequence of the fifth person coming. Consequential reasoning is about weighting the impact of alternatives. Imagine five people driving to meeting, requiring a two cars. We need the second car as a consequence of the fifth person coming. We can use this info to consider alternative options. What if the fifth person joins the meeting remotely? Consequential reasoning is about weighting the impact of alternatives. Consequential reasoning weighs the pros and cons of decisions often in terms of total carbon emissions rather than focusing on how to allocate the responsibility to each party.

Enters the GHG protocol.Attributional  Accounting purposes  “Post-mortem” analysis without predicting power [ GHG protocol ] The GHG protocol devides emissions into three scopes. Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3 Direct emissions from the fossil fuels you burn. Indirect emissions from the electricity you use. Indirect emissions from your supply and value chains. That’s “all the rest” [ GHG protocol ] The emissions’ scope for a given product depends on who made it, and how. Let’s consider the preparation of your favorite hot beverage. [ GSF procurement post ] Scope 1 Direct emissions from the fossil fuels you burn. Scope 2 Indirect emissions from the electricity you use. Scope 3 Indirect emissions from your supply and value chains. Setting the boundaries of Scope 3 is not trivial and somewhat subjective. What do you count in the footprint of...  a web search?  a video call?  an email? [ Hotcarbon 2023, A ] “Your scope 3 is someone else’s scopes 1&2” The GHG protocol provides a general framework, to be translated into domain-specific guidelines.

Big tech companies claim they are already carbon neutral. Problem solved? Carbon-neutral is not the same as Net-zero. Carbon neutral  A way for countries and businesses to claim they are offsetting their emissions That means balancing the amount of CO2e emitted with an equivalent offset, typically through carbon credits.  Usually considers Scope 1 and 2 only. Scope 3 emissions can account for 70-95% of a business’s total emissions. [ Net Zero Now ]  Often rely on low-quality offsets such as EACs (more on that later) Carbon-neutral is not the same as Net-zero.
