Use a zip file or tarball that contains the report and all other files you used for the report, i.e., the entire Verilog project folder and/or all schematics you drew. If any files are missing, it may negatively impact your grade. No shortcuts/links will be accepted. Only one member from each group should submit the report. All members of the group will get the same grade. The submitted fileâ€™s name should be Lab8-2_LastName1_LastName2.zip (or .tar), where LastName1, LastName2 are the last names of the members of the group. The deadline for the report is a hard deadline and it will not be extended. Exercise 1 (2 Points) Below is a part of the MIPS block diagram. Draw the necessary modifications for the memory-mapped I/O on this block diagram. (We are only interested in the SW and LW instructions; the rest of the block diagram has been purposefully left out. Hint: If your circuit works, you already implemented this in the MIPS.v module. Digital Design and Computer Architecture: Lab Report Lab 8: Full System Integration (Session II) Date Grade Names Lab session / lab room 2 Exercise 2 (1 Point) Using Figure 1 as a reference, what additional hardware/architectural changes are needed in the top module (top.v file) to implement Challenge 2 described in the Manual of Lab 8, Session 2? You can either draw the additional circuitry required or write in your own words here.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
