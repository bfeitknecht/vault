W. Dijkstra Imagine five philosophers who spend their lives thinking and eating. They sit around a circular table with five chairs with a big plate of spaghetti. However, there are only five chopsticks available. Task 1 - Dining Philosophers 151 Each philosopher thinks and when he gets hungry picks up the two chopsticks closest to him. • If a philosopher can pick up BOTH chopsticks, he eats for a while. • After a philosopher finishes eating, he puts down the chopsticks and starts to think again. How can a deadlock occur here? Task 1 - Dining Philosophers 152 Each philosopher thinks and when he gets hungry picks up the two chopsticks closest to him. • If a philosopher can pick up BOTH chopsticks, he eats for a while. • After a philosopher finishes eating, he puts down the chopsticks and starts to think again. How can a deadlock occur here? We need to break the cyclic dependency somehow. Find a solution that… 153 • Makes deadlocks impossible • Has no starvation • More than one parallel eating philosopher is possible Task 2 – Monitors, Conditions and Bridges 155 Only either 3 cars or one truck may be on the bridge at each moment. Implement Classes BridgeMonitor and BridgeCondition Task 2 – Monitors, Conditions and Bridges 156 Only either 3 cars or one truck may be on the bridge at each moment. Implement Classes BridgeMonitor and BridgeCondition Look at slides about monitors, everything you should need What we are givenWhat we need Count cars and trucks currently on bridge with volatile variables What we need Count cars and trucks currently on bridge with volatile variables What we need Count cars and trucks currently on bridge with volatile variables Wait for bridge to become available Conditions Create conditions: Conditions Create conditions: f.eg conditions like: What we need Count cars and trucks currently on bridge with volatile variables Wait for bridge to become available When available, increment count. Spoiler:Task 3 – Semaphores and Databases 165 Use semaphores to implement login and logout database functionality that supports up to 10 concurrent users Use barrier to implement 2-phase backup functionality. Task 3 – Semaphores and Databases 166 Implement Classes MySemaphore and MyBarrier Use monitors for both to avoid busy loop Try to understand the existing DatabaseJava implementation before implementing your own semaphore and barrier. We basically did that already in the exercise class, else look into the slides again.
