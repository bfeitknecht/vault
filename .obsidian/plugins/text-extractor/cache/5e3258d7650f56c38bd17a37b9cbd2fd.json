Which of the following statements are true? (The number of correct answers is between 0 and 4.) (a) If we reject the null hypothesis, the realized p-value must be less than or equal to the significance level α. (b) If the realized p-value is less than or equal to the level α, we reject the null hypothesis. (c) The realized p-value tells us the probability that H0 is true. (d) If the realized p-value is very low, it indicates that our data do not fit the null hypothesis well. Exercise 13.2. Compute the realized p-values for the tests from Exercises 12.3, 12.4, 12.6, and 12.7. Remark: You should write down an explicit formula (e.g., involving the standard normal CDF), but you do not need to compute its numerical value. Remark: To compute the numerical value, you can use Wolfram Alpha to find values of the standard normal distribution function or Python: from scipy.stats import norm value = norm.cdf(x=1.96) # Replace x with the value you’re interested in print(value) You can find values of other distribution functions analogously. Exercise 13.3. The average travel time from Zurich to Bellinzona by Intercity train is 146 minutes. The following times are recorded for the Cisalpino: x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 152 145 141 137 145 146 139 147 138 We assume that these values are realizations of an i.i.d. sample X1, . . . , Xn with Xi ∼ N (µ, σ2), where µ is an unknown parameter and σ2 = 9 is known. (a) Perform an appropriate test at the 5% level to determine whether the mean travel time of the Cisalpino differs from that of the Intercity. (b) Compute the realized p-value. (c) What is the lowest level α at which you would still reject the null hypothesis? Exercise 13.4. Let {Pθ : θ ∈ Θ}, where Θ ⊆ R, be a family of models, and let X1, . . . , Xn be i.i.d. random variables from the distribution Pθ. Assume that we have a confidence interval for θ of the form [A = a(X1, . . . , Xn), B = b(X1, . . . , Xn)] with coverage probability 1 − α. Further, consider the hypotheses H0 : θ = θ0, H1 : θ ̸= θ0, (1) where θ0 ∈ Θ is fixed. 1 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek (a) Show that the test procedure “We reject H0 if and only if θ0 /∈ [A, B]” defines a test at level α. (b) Conversely, for every θ0 ∈ Θ, let (Tθ0 , Kθ0) be a test for (1) at level α. Show that the random set S(ω) := {θ0 ∈ Θ : Tθ0(ω) /∈ Kθ0 } is a confidence set for θ with coverage probability at least 1 − α. That is, show that Pθ0 [θ0 ∈ S] ≥ 1 − α, θ0 ∈ Θ. (c) How would you modify the confidence interval in (a) for the one-sided alternative H0 : θ = θ0, H′ 1 : θ > θ0? Exercise 13.5. Find the p-values for the tests from Exercise 12.5. 2 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Rewind These are some additional exercises for you to review some of the material we covered during the semester. MC 13.6. Let X1, X2, . . . be a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with E[X 2 1 ] < ∞. Let Z be a standard normally distributed random variable. We define µ := E[X1] and σ2 := Var[X1]. Which of the following statements is correct? (Exactly one answer is correct.) (a) lim n→∞ P [ 1 σ2n n∑ i=1 Xi ≤ a ] = P[Z ≤ a], a ∈ R. (b) lim n→∞ P [ 1 σ2n n∑ i=1(Xi − µ) ≤ a ] = P[Z ≤ a], a ∈ R. (c) lim n→∞ P [ 1 √σ2n n∑ i=1(Xi − µ) ≤ a ] = P[Z ≤ a], a ∈ R. (d) lim n→∞ P [ 1 √σ2n n∑ i=1 Xi ≤ a ] = P[Z ≤ a], a ∈ R. MC 13.7. Does the correct answer to MC 13.6 also hold exactly for finite n (i.e., if we omit limn→∞)? (The number of correct answers is between 0 and 4.) (a) The correct answer to MC 13.6 also holds without the limit for all distributions satisfying E[X 2 1 ] < ∞. (b) The correct answer to MC 13.6 also holds without the limit if the Xi’s are normally distributed. (c) The correct answer to MC 13.6 also holds without the limit if µ = 0 and σ = 1. (d) The correct answer to MC 13.6 never holds exactly for finite n if the limit is omitted. Exercise 13.8. It costs $1 to play a particular slot machine in Las Vegas. The machine is programmed so that it pays out $2 with probability 0.45 (the player wins), and nothing with probability 0.55 (the casino wins). Let Xi be the net gain of the casino on the i-th round of the game. Let Sn := ∑n i=1 Xi be the casino’s total gain after n rounds. Assuming that the outcomes of the games are independent, determine: (a) E[Sn] and Var[Sn]; (b) the approximate probability that after 10 ′000 rounds, the casino’s gain lies between $800 and $1100. Assume that we know the casino’s gain after 10′000 rounds is $1200. (c) Based on this observation, can we conclude that the probability the casino wins is greater than the stated value 0.55? Use significance level α = 0.05. 3 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Exercise 13.9. A team of three people is randomly selected from a group of six people. Among the six are three women (Anna, Elsa, and Helga) and three men (Franz, Mario, and Tobias). Let X be the number of women and Y the number of men in the selected team. (a) What is the conditional probability that the team consists only of women, given that the team includes at least one woman? (b) What is the conditional probability that the team consists only of women, given that Helga is in the team? (c) Find the joint distribution of (X, Y ). Compute E[X] and E[Y ]. (d) Compute Var[X], Var[X + Y ], Cov(X, Y ), and Corr(X, Y ). Exercise 13.10. Let X and Y be independent random variables where X is uniformly distributed on [0, 1] and Y is exponentially distributed with parameter 1. Define U = X + Y and V = XY . (a) Compute E [ V X 2 + 1 ] . (b) Determine the distribution function and the density function of U . 4 Probability and Statistics (D-INFK) Lecturer: Prof. Dr. Dylan Possamaï Coordinator: Daniel Kršek Quantile table for the standard normal distribution 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.95 0.975 0.99 0.995 0.999 0 0.6745 1.2816 1.6449 1.9600 2.3263 2.5758 3.0902 .
