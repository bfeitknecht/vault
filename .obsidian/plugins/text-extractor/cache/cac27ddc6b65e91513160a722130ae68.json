We identify these symbols with the numbers in {0, 1, 2, . . . , k}, where 0 = ¢ and k = . The given 1-tape-TM meets the property that the content of its working tape is always sorted in ascending order and contains exactly one symbol 0, i.e., it has the form 01 i12 i2 . . . (k − 1)ik−1kkk . . . for some i1, . . . , ik−1 ∈ N at any moment. It further holds that SpaceM (n) = s(n) for some arbitrary function s(n). Prove that TimeM (n) ∈ O(n · (s(n)) k). 10 points Task 26 Let f : N → N be a monotonically increasing function such that f (n) ≥ n for all n ∈ N. (a) Prove that NTIME(f ) is closed under union. (b) Let L ∈ NTIME(f ) and L ′ ∈ TIME(f ). Prove that L − L′ ∈ NTIME(f ). 10 points Task 27 For any infinite language L ⊆ {0, 1} ∗, describe how to obtain a subset of L that is not recursively enumerable and justify your approach. 10 points Submission: On Friday, November 29, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
