Σ=(S,P,–τ,ϕ), where for all s∈S and p∈P we defineProve or disprove the following statements.a) If Σ is sound, then Σ is complete.b) If Σ is complete, then Σ is sound.Through tertium non datur we can assume;a)For the scope of this exercise, we assume that S≠∅ and P≠∅.If Σ is sound that means \"for all statements s∈S for which there exists a p∈P with ϕ(s,p)=1 we have τ(s)=1\", which is the same as to say that\"there does not exist an s∈S with τ(s)=0 such that there exists a p∈P with ϕ(s,p)=1\".Which is the same as to say that \"there does not exist an s∈S with –τ(s)=1 such that there exists a p∈P with ϕ(s,p)=0\". Since –τ(s) and ϕ(s,p) inΣ are, per definition the opposite of τ(s) and ϕ(s,p) in Σ.Which is to say that \"for all s∈S with –τ(s)=1 there exists a p∈P such that ϕ(s,p)=1\". All this essentially tells us, that if Σ is sound, there is nos∈S in Σ for which –τ(s)=1 and ϕ(s,p)=0.So all true statements in Σ have a proof p∈P for which ϕ(s,p)=1. Thus, if Σ is sound Σ is complete (if we assume S,P≠∅).□If we consider S and P to possibly be the empty set, the implication could be disproven by contradiction as follows:Let Σ={S,P,τ,ϕ} where S={0}, P=∅, τ(0)=0 and ϕ:S×P→{0,1}(Definition of cartesian product between set and empty set implies S×∅=∅)Let Σ={S,P,–τ,ϕ} where S={0}, P=∅, –τ(0)=1 and ϕ:S×P→{0,1}Σ is sound, as there is no s∈S such that τ(s)=1 (Definition of Sound). Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the implication holds, i.e.for all –τ(s)=1 there exists a p∈P such that ϕ(s,p)=1. However, we arrive at a contradiction, as we defined P=∅. Thus there exists no p∈Psuch that ϕ(s,p)=1 if we consider P to be the empty set.–––τ(s)=1⟺τ(s)=0,ϕ(s,p)=1⟺ϕ(s,p)=0.––––τ(s)=0⟺τ(s)=1,ϕ(s,p)=0⟺ϕ(s,p)=1.–Definition 6.2.A Proof System is sound if no false statement has a proof, i.e. for all statements for which there exists a proof p∈P such that theverification function returns true ϕ(s,p)=1, the statement must be true τ(s)=1.Definition 6.3.A Proof System is complete if every true statement has a proof, i.e. for all statements s∈S that are true, there exists a proof p∈P such thatthe verification function returns true ϕ(s,p)=1.––––––––––––––b)For the scope of this exercise we again assume that S≠∅ and P≠∅.If Σ is complete that means \"for all statements s∈S with τ(s)=1 there exists a proof p∈P such that ϕ(s,p)=1\".Which (per definition) is the same as to say \"for all statements s∈S with –τ(s)=0 there exists a proof p∈P such that ϕ(s,p)=0 in Σ\".Which gives us no further information on the soundness of the proof system Σ, as all we know is that for all false statements there exists a proof,such that the verification of that statement with that proof is false.Let's disprove the implication with a counterexample:Let Σ={S,P,τ,ϕ} where S={0,1}, P={0,1}, τ(1)=1, τ(0)=0 and ϕ(1,0)=0, ϕ(1,1)=1, ϕ(0,0)=0, ϕ(0,1)=0.Let Σ={S,P,τ,ϕ} where S={0,1}, P={0,1}, –τ(1)=0, –τ(0)=1 and ϕ(1,0)=1, ϕ(1,1)=0.As we can clearly see, Σ is complete (per definition of complete) but Σ is not sound (since there exist a s∈S such that –τ(s)=0 but ϕ(s,p)=1, i.e. afalse statement has a proof). The implication is thus disproven by counterexample.□––––––––","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
