Widely used programming language in academia and industry Lots of courses downstream use Java Lots of resources available online and in books Sophisticated support of concurrency in the language and in libraries 3 Java Platform independence via bytecode interpretation Java programs run (in theory) on any computing device (PC, mobile phones, Toaster, Windows, Linux, Android) Java compiler translates source to byte code Java virtual machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode of the compiled program 46 Key JVM Components Memory Allocators Garbage Collectors Portability Layer Bytecode Interpreter JIT Compiler Resolver/ Loader Native Interface Bytecode Verification JVM Operating System: Linux, Windows, OSEK/VDX, etc… Architecture: x86, ARM, TI DSP, etc… Program.class Resolver, Loader Loads class files and setups their internal memory….but when? class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { if (args[0].equals(“nuf si HTE”)) LoadMe t = new LoadMe(); } } class LoadMe() { static int x = 0; static { System.out.println (“Got statically initialized”); } } The JVM has a choice here: Eager: the JVM resolves the reference to LoadMe when class Test is first loaded. Lazy: the JVM resolves the reference to LoadMe when it is actually needed (here, when the LoadMe object is created). Most JVMs are lazy. Static initialization of the class is quite non- trivial, can be done concurrently by many Java threads (we will see what a Thread is later). Typically done before the class is used. Bytecode Verification Automatically verifies bytecode provided to JVM satisfies certain security constraints. Usually done right after the class is located and loaded, but before static initialization • bytecodes type check • no illegal casts • no conversion from integers to pointers • no calling of directly private methods of another class • no jumping into the middle of a method • ….and others Minor problem: Automated verification is undecidable. Practically, this means the verifier may reject valid programs that actually do satisfy the constraints. L The goal is to design a verifier that accepts as many valid programs as possible. J Bytecode Interpreter A program inside the JVM that interprets the bytecodes in the class files generated by the javac compiler using a stack and local variable storage. • JVM is a stack based abstract machine: bytecodes pop and push values on the stack • A set of registers, typically used for local variables and parameters: accessed by load and store instructions • For each method, the number of stack slots and registers is specified in the class file • Most JVM bytecodes are typed. The bytecode interpreter is typically slow as its pushing and popping values from a stack… One can speed-up the interpreter but in practice parts of code that are frequently executed simply get compiled by the Just in Time (JIT) compiler to native code (e.g., Intel x86, etc)…next. Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) Compiles the bytecode to machine code (e.g., ARM, DSP, x86, etc) on-demand, especially when a method is frequently executed (hot method). JIT makes bytecodes fast J Compilation of bytecode to machine code happens during program execution. Typically needs profiling data to know which method is hot or cold. Can be expensive to gather during execution. In this example, method inc(int) is a hot method so may be inlined inside the main to avoid the overheads of function calling. A modern JIT compiler has 100’s of optimizations… class Test { public static int inc(int j) {return j + 1; } public static void main(String args[]) { int j = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) j = inc(j); }} Memory Allocators Consists of, often concurrent algorithms, which are invoked when your Java program allocates memory. Object allocation in Java invokes the JVM memory allocator. The JVM memory allocator often has to ask the underlying OS for memory which it then manages internally. The allocator algorithms typically have to be concurrent because multiple Java threads (we will learn about threads later) can allocate memory. Otherwise, if sequential, one may see major pause times in their application. class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { A a = new A(); int t[][] = new int[2][5]; }} Garbage Collectors (GC) JVM uses many different GC algorithms, often concurrent and parallel, invoked periodically to collect memory unreachable by your program. Frees the programmer from having to free memory manually…which is good as it avoids tricky bugs. Many different GC algorithms: generational, concurrent, parallel, mark and sweep, etc. Trade-off different performance goals. Concurrent GC algorithms are very difficult to get correct. finalize() method called when GC collects the object. class Test { public static void main(String args[]) { A a = new A(); a = null; // memory of A() now unreachable. System.gc(); // force GC while(true); // wait till it triggers J }} class A() { public void finalize() { System.out.println(“I got freed by the GC”); }} Native Interface When your Java program calls a native method, one has to convert the JVM parameters (e.g., what is on the stack) into machine registers (e.g, x86) following the calling convention. As the JVM interpreter is executing the Java program, at some point it may have to call a native method: some code written in C or C++ say. To do so, the JVM has to pass the parameters to the native method in a particular way so to interact with binaries on the particular platform. This is not a large module but can be tricky to get the types correct. java.lang.Object contains many native methods (e.g., starting a thread) for which the JVM provides an internal implementation. class Test { public static native int print(double d); public static void main(String args[]) { print(5.2); }} Portability Layer When the JVM is to run on top of Windows vs. Linux or x86 vs. ARM, the JVM designer must implement a small number of JVM constructs (e.g., synchronization, threading) using the primitives of the underlying operating system and architecture. Portability Layers Operating System: Linux, Windows, OSEK/VDX, etc… Example: Java provides its own notion of a thread (as we will see later). However, the operating system has a different notion of what a thread is. So this layer somehow needs to come up with a way to use the OS notion of a thread to provide the Java notion of a thread that the Java programmer expects. If you want your JVM to run on a different OS, you need to write the portability layer. e.g.: Java notion of a Thread must be mapped to e.g.: OS notion of a thread Look inside via: javap –c Test 17 You can find the meaning of all JVM instructions here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5 This kind of usage of ‘javap’ is not examinable but it may help you to get deeper understanding of how the Java language actually gets executed. We will see how this is helpful later with constructs such as synchronized and volatile and why this is instructive. Lets look a bit at the bytecodes… 19 class Test { static int x = 2018; double d; public static native int print(double d); public double pp(int a) { return a; } public static void main(String args[]) { Test t = new Test(); t.d = t.pp(1) + x; Test.print(t.d); } } javac Test.java Test.class What is inside here? 20 class Test { static int x; double d; Test(); Code: 0: aload_0 1: invokespecial #1 // Method java/lang/Object.\"<init>\": ()V 4: return public static native int print(double); public double pp(int); Code: 0: iload_1 1: i2d 2: dreturn static {}; Code: 0: sipush 2018 3: putstatic #5 // Field x:I 6: return } Pushes content of local variable 0 (note: the variable is of a reference type) to the stack. Invoke constructor for the superclass of Test, that is, java.lang.Object…and clear the stack. Native method. Its implementation could be provided for example in a C/C++ library. Pushes content of local variable 1 (type integer) to stack. convert the integer on the stack to a double. Pop value from stack and return it. push constant 2018 of type short (hence: si) to stack pop 2018 from stack and write it to static field x. JVM invokes this code before main() Constructor for class Test 21 public static void main(java.lang.String[]); Code: 0: new #2 // class Test 3: dup 4: invokespecial #3 // Method \"<init>\":()V 7: astore_1 8: aload_1 9: aload_1 10: iconst_1 11: invokevirtual #4 // Method pp:(I)D 14: getstatic #5 // Field x:I 17: i2d 18: dadd 19: putfield #6 // Field d:D 22: aload_1 23: getfield #6 // Field d:D 26: invokestatic #7 // Method print:(D)I 29: pop 30: return Create the object of class Test and push it on the stack. Object not yet initialized! Triggers the JVM’s memory allocator. Duplicate object reference on the stack. Invoke constructor for top-of-stack object (pops it). This initializes it as we saw before. After, 1 reference to object remains Store top-of-stack reference in local variable and pops it. Stack now empty. Load reference from local variable 1 onto the stack. Load reference from local variable 1 onto the stack again. push the constant 1 onto the stack Invoke method pp(). Pops the constant 1 and the reference. Method returns a value stored on top of the stack. Read the value of the static field ‘x’ and push it onto the stack. Convert to a double. Add two values on top of stack (pop them) and produce 1 value. …..// we skip 19, 22 and 23 here: can do it yourself. We are invoking a native method! The native interface component of the JVM will make sure local vars/stack information is converted to the particular binary interface… Today 22 • Sneak peek into JVMs • Brief overview of JVM components … • … spending a bit more time on bytecode • This material is not examinable.

Compiler errors 2. Runtime errors 3. Logic errors Data types Type: A category or set of data values. • Constrains the operations that can be performed on data • Many languages ask the programmer to specify types • Examples: integer, real number, string Internally, computers store everything as 1s and 0s 104 à 01101000 Primitive Types in Java Source: Christian Ullenboom: Java ist auch eine Insel, Galileo Computing, 8. Auflage, 2009, ISBN 3-8362-1371-4 Java's primitive types Primitive types: 8 simple types for numbers, text, etc. Name Description Examples • int integers (up to 231 - 1) 42, -3, 0, 926394 • double real numbers (up to 10308) 3.1, -0.25, 9.4e3 • char single text characters 'a', 'X', '?', '\\n' • boolean logical values true, false Why does Java distinguish integers vs. real numbers? Primitive Types – Complete List Integer: • byte (8 Bits) • short (16 Bits) • int (32 Bits) • long (64 Bits) Real numbers: • float (32 Bits) • double (64 Bits) Characters (Unicode): • char (16 Bits) Booleans: • boolean 38 Range: -2147483648 ... 2147483647 or −2!\" to 2!\"-1 65536 different values, allows for non-English characters Examples: 18.0 , -0.18e2 , .341E-2 Values: true , false Operators: &&, | |, ! Type conversion (Casting) Java is a strongly typed language, so the compiler can detect type errors at compile time 40 int myInt; float myFloat = -3.14159f; myInt = myFloat; int myInt; float myFloat = -3.14159f; myInt = (int)myFloat; Compile time error Explicit type cast (truncates value) Bytecode: 0: ldc #2 // float -3.14159f 2: fstore_2 3: fload_2 4: f2i 5: istore_1 6: return The Two-way if Statement if (boolean-expression) { statement(s)-for-the-true-case; } else { statement(s)-for-the-false-case; } 42 Nested if/else Chooses between outcomes using many tests if (test) { statement(s); } else if (test) { statement(s); } else { statement(s); } Example: if (x > 0) { System.out.println(\"Positive\"); } else if (x < 0) { System.out.println(\"Negative\"); } else { System.out.println(\"Zero\"); } 43Tip: in parallelism/concurrency…try to have the if /else’s read from a local variable. Loops: walkthrough for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) { System.out.println(i + \" squared = \" + (i * i)); } System.out.println(\"Whoo!\"); Output: 1 squared = 1 2 squared = 4 3 squared = 9 4 squared = 16 Whoo! 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 47What can happen if ‘i’ is not a local variable and we have many processes? J Categories of loops Bounded loop: Executes a known number of times. • The for loops we have seen are bounded loops. • print \"hello\" 10 times. • print each odd number between 5 and 127. Unbounded loop: where number of times its body repeats is unknown in advance. • e.g. repeat until the user types \"q\" to quit. 48 How would you write the mutual exclusion algorithm for a single participant from last lecture? What kind of loop would we use? The while loop while loop: repeatedly executes its body as long as a logical test is true. while (test) { statement(s); } Example: int num = 1; // initialization while (num <= 200) { // test System.out.print(num + \" \"); num = num * 2; // update } // output: 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 49 Arrays Array: object that stores many values of the same type. • element: One value in an array. • index: A 0-based integer to access an element from an array. index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 value 12 49 -2 26 5 17 -6 84 72 3 element 0 element 4 element 9 52 How are multi dimensional arrays represented? Example: int [] [] PP = new int[10][20] Strings String: An object storing a sequence of text characters. • Unlike most other objects, a String can be created without new. String name = \"text\"; String name = expression; • Examples: String name = “ETH 2021 Parallel Programming\"; int x = 3; int y = 5; String point = \"(\" + x + \", \" + y + \")\"; 59 Indexes Characters of a string are numbered with 0-based indexes: String name = \"R. Kelly\"; • First character's index : 0 • Last character's index : 1 less than the string's length • The individual characters are values of type char index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 character R . K e l l y 60 Objects Object: An entity that contains data and behavior. • data: variables inside the object • behavior: methods inside the object • You interact with the methods; the data is hidden in the object. Constructing (creating) an object: Type objectName = new Type(parameters); Calling an object's method: objectName.methodName(parameters); http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html Bicycle: An example Software objects are similar to real world objects They have states and behaviors • States are stored in variables (Java: fields) • Behavior is exposed via methods Methods are used for object-to-object communication Methods hide the internal state (and the concrete implementation) from the outside world (developer) 71 http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html Object references Arrays and objects use reference semantics. • efficiency. Copying large objects slows down a program. • sharing. It's useful to share an object's data among methods. DrawingPanel panel1 = new DrawingPanel(80, 50); DrawingPanel panel2 = panel1; // same window panel2.setBackground(Color.CYAN); panel1 panel2 Pass by reference value (Objects) When an object is passed as a parameter, the object is not copied. The parameter refers to the same object. • If the parameter is modified, it will affect the original object. public static void main(String[] args) { DrawingPanel window = new DrawingPanel(80, 50); window.setBackground(Color.YELLOW); example(window); } public static void example(DrawingPanel panel) { panel.setBackground(Color.CYAN); ... } panel window Static Variables, Constants, and Methods Static variables are shared by all the instances of the class. Static methods are not tied to a specific object. Static constants are final variables shared by all the instances of the class. CONCURRENCY ISSUES? 77 Instance Variables, and Methods Instance variables belong to a specific class instance. Instance methods are invoked by an instance of the class. 78 Exceptions Advantages of exception handling: • enables a method to throw an exception to its caller • without this, a method must handle the exception or terminate the program public static int quotient(int number1, int number2) { if (number2 == 0) throw new ArithmeticException(\"Divisor cannot be zero\"); return number1 / number2; } 84 Language features vs. parallelism: Guidelines • Keep variables as ‘local’ as possible: global variables means they can be accessed by various parallel activities. While when its local to the process/thread, we are safe against inadvertent accesses to the variable. • If possible, avoid aliasing of references: aliasing can lead to unexpected updates to memory through a process that accesses a seemingly unrelated variable (named differently). • If possible, avoid mutable state, in particular when aliased: aliasing is no problem if the shared object is immutable, but concurrent mutations can make bugs really hard to reproduce and investigate (“Heisenbugs”) 87 Language features vs. parallelism: Guidelines • Exceptions vs. Concurrency/Parallelism: • Exceptions tend to be less effective with parallelism because the cause of the error may be far earlier in the execution than where the exception triggers. Hence, the stack trace of the exception can be less informative and useful. • Exceptions thrown in a thread (parallel process) don’t automatically reach the main program, and thus might go completely unnoticed. This can make it (even) more complicated to track down the root cause of a bug. 88 Summary • Sneak peek into JVMs • Brief overview of JVM components … • … spending a bit more time on bytecode • This material is not examinable.
