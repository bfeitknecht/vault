Semantics: A(◯xiF ) = 1 ⟺ {u ∈ U A | A[xi→u](F ) = 1} ∼ U A. Using the semantics of predicate logic extended in this way , prove or disprove the following statements, where F is an arbitrary formula. a) The formula (◯xF ) ∧ (◯x¬F ) is unsatisfiable. b) ◯xF ⊨ ∃xF c) ∀x◯yF ⊨ ◯y∀xF Expectation: If the statement is true, your proof should use the definitions of the semantics. In each step, at most one definition (e.g., the semantics of ◯) should be applied. If the statement is not true, you should provide a counterexample: make sure to define everything needed for a suitable interpretation. a) The formula (◯xF ) ∧ (◯x¬F ) is unsatisfiable. Disproven by counterexample. W e want to show that there exists an interpretation A such that (◯xF ∧ (◯x¬F ) = 1, making the formula satisfiable. Let F be the formula P (x) Let A = (U, ϕ, ψ, ξ) be a suitable interpretation for the formula. Let U A = N∗ Let ϕ = ∅ (there are no functions in our formula) Let ψ = {P A(x) = 1 ⟺ x ≡2 0,  i.e. P A(x) = 1 if and only if x is even} Let ξ = ∅ (there are no free variables in our formula) All that remains is to show is that {u ∈ N ∣ u is even)} ∼ N and {u ∈ N ∣ u is not even} ∼ N. We define two sets S = {u ∈ N ∣ u is even} and T = {u ∈ N ∣ u is not even} and construct a bijection between them and N∗ Let f : N → S be defined as f(x) = 2 ⋅ x. It's easy to see that, for every x ∈ N, f(x) ∈ S. Let g : N → T be defined as g(x) = 2 ⋅ x + 1. Since, for every x ∈ N, f(x) ∈ T as f(x) ≡2 1 for all x ∈ N. Thus both parts are satisfiable under some interpretation A, disproving the statement. □ b) ◯xF ⊨ ∃xF We proof this by showing that any interpretation that's suitable for both sides of the formula and is a model for ◯xF is also a model for ∃xF . Since any U A (where A is a model for the LHS) is equinumerous to the set {u ∈ U A | A[xi→u](F ) = 1} and no U A can be empty (as per Definition 6.34.), that same A is also a model for ∃xF , by definition 6.36. A(∃xF ) A((◯xF ∧ (◯x¬F ) ⋅ ⟹ A((◯xP (x)) ∧ (◯x¬P (x))) (Definition of F ) ⋅ ⟹ A((◯xP (x))) and A((◯x¬P (x))) (Definition 6.24; Semantics of ∧ ) ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ U A ∣ A[x→u](P (x)) = 1} ∼ N and {u ∈ U A ∣ A[x→u](¬P (x)) = 1} ∼ N (Semantics of ◯xi) ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ U A ∣ A(P (u) = 1)} ∼ N and {u ∈ U A ∣ A(¬P (u) = 1)} ∼ N ([x → u]) ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ U A ∣ A(P (u) = 1)} ∼ N and {u ∈ U A ∣ A(P (u) = 0)} ∼ N (Definition 6.24; Semantics of ¬) ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ U A ∣ u is even)} ∼ N and {u ∈ U A ∣ u is not even} ∼ N (Interpretation of P A(x)) ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ N ∣ u is even)} ∼ N and {u ∈ N ∣ u is not even} ∼ N (Interpretation of U A) As was to be shown. □ c) ∀x◯yF ⊨ ◯y∀xF We will disprove this statement with a counterexample. Let F be the formula P (x, y) Let A = (U, ϕ, ψ, ξ) be a suitable interpretation for the formula. Let U A = N∗ Let ϕ = ∅ (there are no functions in our formula) Let ψ = {P A(x) = 1 ⟺ y > x,  i.e. P A(x) = 1 if and only if y is greater than x} Let ξ = ∅ (there are no free variables in our formula) What this is saying in words is, that our chosen interpretation A is a model for the LHS (since, for all natural numbers x ∈ N∗, there is a set of numbers yi ∈ N∗ equinumerous to the set of natural nubers ( {yi ∈ N∗} ∼ N∗) that is larger than than x) but not a model for the RHS (since, not for every number xi ∈ N all numbers yi ∈ N are larger than that number). We have shown there exists some interpretation A that is suitable for both sides of the formula and is a model for ∀x◯yF but not for ◯y∀xF . □ A(◯xiF ) = 1 ⋅ ⟹ {u ∈ U A | A[xi→u](F ) = 1} ∼ U A and U A ≠ ∅ (Semantics of ◯xi, Definition 6.34. U ≠ ∅) ⋅ ⟹ A[x→u](F ) = 1 for some u ∈ U Definition 6.36. A(∃xF ) ⋅ ⟹ A(∃xF ) = 1 A(∀x◯yF ) ⊨ A(◯y∀xF ) ⋅ ⟹ A(∀x◯yP (x, y)) ⊨ A(◯y∀xP (x, y)) (1) ⋅ ⟹ A[x→u](◯yP (x, y)) = 1 for all u ∈ U A ⊨ A(◯y∀xP (x, y)) (2) ⋅ ⟹ A[x→u](◯yP (x, y)) = 1 for all u ∈ U A ⊨ {u ∈ U A ∣ {A[x→u](∀xP (x, y)) = 1} ∼ U A (3) ⋅ ⟹ A[x→u]({u ∈ U A ∣ A[y→v](P (x, y) = 1} ∼ U A) = 1 for all v ∈ U A ⊨ {u ∈ U A ∣ {A[y→v](∀xP (x, y)) = 1} ∼ U A (4) ⋅ ⟹ A[x→u]({u ∈ U A ∣ A[y→v](P (x, y) = 1} ∼ U A) = 1 for all v ∈ U A ⊨ {u ∈ U A ∣ {A[y→v](A[x→u](P (x, y)) = 1 for all v ∈ U A) = 1} ∼ U A (5) ⋅ ⟹ A({u ∈ U A ∣ A[y→v](P (y, u) = 1} ∼ U A) = 1 for all v ∈ U A ⊨ {u ∈ U A ∣ {A[y→u](A(P (u, y)) = 1 for all v ∈ U A) = 1} ∼ U A (6) ⋅ ⟹ A({u ∈ U A ∣ A(P (v, u) = 1} ∼ U A) = 1 for all v ∈ U A ⊨ {u ∈ U A ∣ {A(A(P (u, v)) = 1 for all v ∈ U A) = 1} ∼ U A (7) (1) (Definition of F ) (2) (Definition 6.36. ∀xF ) (3) (Semantics of ◯xF ) (4) (Semantics of ◯xF ) (5) (Definition 6.36. ∀xF ) (6) [x → u] (7) [y → v]","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
