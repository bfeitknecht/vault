(see Deﬁnition 5.33). c) b(x) is not irreducible. Since b(1) = 0 and b(2) = 0, we obtain via Lemma 5.29 that b(x) = (x + 2)(x + 1). 10.2 Integral Domains and Fields a) For example, Z, Z[x], Q[x]. b) We have to prove that every a ∈ D \\ {0} is a unit. Let a ∈ D \\ {0} be arbitrary. We deﬁne the function fa : D → D by fa(x) = a · x. We show that fa is bijective: injective: Assume that there exist x, y ∈ D such that fa(x) = fa(y) and x ̸= y. 0 = fa(y) − fa(x) = a · y − (a · x) = a · y + a · (−x) = a · (y − x), where the third step follows from Lemma 5.17, and the last step uses the dis- tributive law. Since by assumption a ̸= 0 and y − x ̸= 0, it follows that a is a zero-divisor, which is a contradiction with D being an integral domain. surjective: If fa was not surjective, we would have y /∈ Im(fa) for some y ∈ D, which for ﬁnite D implies |Im(fa)| < |D|. But since fa is injective, the function f ′ a : D → Im(fa) deﬁned by f ′ a(x) = fa(x) is bijective, so |Im(fa)| = |D|, which is a contradiction. The inverse of a is f −1 a (1), because a · f −1 a (1) = fa(f −1 a (1)) = 1, hence, a is a unit. 10.3 Polynomials over a Field a) In Z7, the multiplicative inverse of 5 is 3, because 3 · 5 ≡7 1. Therefore, the ﬁrst coefﬁcient of the result is 3. The rest of the computation proceeds analogously: (x5 + 6x2 +5) : (5x2 + 2x + 1) = 3x3 + 3x2 + x + 3 −(x5+ 6x4+ 3x3 ) x4+ 4x3+ 6x2+ +5 −( x4+ 6x3+ 3x2 ) 5x3+ 3x2+ +5 −(5x3+ 2x2+ x ) + x2+6x+5 −( x2+6x+3) Remainder: 2 b) The irreducible polynomials of degree 4 over GF(2) are x4 + x3 + 1, x4 + x + 1 and x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1. We show this by eliminating all reducible polynomials of degree four. A polynomial p(x) = x4 + a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 is reducible if it is divisible by a polynomial of degree one or two (if it is divisible by a polynomial of degree three, then it must also be divisible by one of degree one). By Lemma 5.29, the polynomials p(x) divisible by a polynomial of degree one are exactly those for which p(0) = 0 or p(1) = 0. Hence, we have to eliminate the poly- nomials for which a0 = 0 or a3 + a2 + a1 + a0 = 1. Remaining are the polynomials: x4 + x3 + 1, x4 + x + 1, x4 + x2 + 1 and x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1. Furthermore, over GF(2) there is only one irreducible polynomial of degree two, namely x2 +x+1 (the other polynomials: x2, x2 +1 and x2 +x can be eliminated in the same way we did above). Hence, we have to also eliminate (x2 +x+1)2 = x4 +x2 +1. 10.4 The Ring F [x]m(x) a) The zero-divisors are those elements of GF(3)[x]x2+2x \\ {0} (that is, the non-zero polynomials of degree at most 1 with coefﬁcients in Z3) which share a common factor (a polynomial of degree at least 1) with the modulus x2 + 2x. The factors of x2 + 2x are x and x + 2, so the zero-divisors are the multiples of x and x + 2 of degree at most 1. These are ax and b(x + 2) for a, b ∈ Z3. Hence, the zero-divisors are: x, 2x, x + 2, 2x + 1. b) We have GF(3)[x]x2+2 = {0, 1, 2, x, x + 1, x + 2, 2x, 2x + 1, 2x + 2}. By Lemma 5.36, GF(3)[x] ∗ x2+2 = {a(x) ∈ GF(3)[x]x2+2 | gcd(a(x), x 2 + 2) = 1}. The task is to ﬁnd all polynomials a(x) ∈ GF(3)[x] of degree at most one, such that gcd(a(x), x2 + 2) = 1. Note ﬁrst that over GF(3), we have x2 + 2 = x2 − 1 = (x + 1)(x − 1) = (x + 1)(x + 2). Hence, all polynomials b(x) of degree at most one, for which gcd(b(x), (x + 1)(x + 2)) ̸= 1 are u(x + 1) and v(x + 2) for some u, v ∈ GF(3). These polynomials are: x + 1, x + 2, 2x + 2, 2x + 1 and 0. The polynomials of degree at most one that are left are in GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2. Therefore, GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2 = {1, 2, x, 2x}. c) The inverse of x ∈ GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2 is a polynomial p(x) ∈ GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2, such that x · p(x) ≡x2+2 1 (where 1 is the constant polynomial). Since all the polynomials in GF(3)[x]∗ x2+2 have degree at most 1 (Deﬁnition 5.34), we have p(x) = ax + b for some a, b ∈ GF(3). Therefore, we only need to ﬁnd a and b such that x · (ax + b) ≡x2+2 1. Note that x · (ax + b) ≡x2+2 ax 2 + bx ≡x2+2 −2a + bx ≡x2+2 a + bx. It is now easy to see that a + bx ≡x2+2 1 when b = 0 and a = 1. Hence, the inverse of the polynomial x is p(x) = x. 10.5 Extension Fields Let F = Z5[x]x2+4x+1. a) The polynomial b(x) = x2 + 4x + 1 ∈ Z5[x] has no roots, because b(0) = 1, b(1) = 1, b(2) = 3, b(3) = 2, b(4) = 3. Since b(x) has degree 2, this implies that it is irreducible (Corollary 5.30). Therefore, F is a ﬁeld (Theorem 5.37). b) By Lemma 5.34 we have |F | = 52 = 25, since |Z5| = 5 and b(x) is of degree 2. As F is a ﬁeld, we have F ∗ = F \\ {0}. Thus, |F ∗| = |F | − 1 = 25 − 1 = 24. By Corollary 5.9 the possible orders of an element in F ∗ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. We prove that ⟨x + 2⟩ = F ∗. Due to the previous observation, it is sufﬁcient to show that (x + 3)k ̸≡b(x) 0 for all k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12}. Clearly, x + 3 ̸≡b(x) 1. Moreover, we have (x + 3)2 ≡b(x) x2 + 6x + 9 ≡b(x) b(x) + (2x + 3) ≡b(x) 2x + 3 ̸≡b(x) 1, (x + 3)4 ≡b(x) (2x + 3)2 ≡b(x) 4x2 + 2x + 4 ≡b(x) 4b(x) + x ≡b(x) x ̸≡b(x) 1, (x + 3)8 ≡b(x) (x) 2 ≡b(x) b(x) + (x + 4) ≡b(x) x + 4 ̸≡b(x) 1, (x + 3)3 ≡b(x) (2x + 3)(x + 3) ≡b(x) 2x2 + 4x + 4 ≡b(x) 2b(x) + (x + 2) ≡b(x) x + 2 ̸≡b(x) 1, (x + 3)6 ≡b(x) (x + 2)2 ≡b(x) x2 + 4x + 4 ≡b(x) 4b(x) + 3 ≡b(x) 3 ̸≡b(x) 1, (x + 3)12 ≡b(x) (3)2 ≡b(x) 4 ̸≡b(x) 1. This concludes the proof. c) Observe that 2x + 3 ≡b(x) (x + 3)2 and 2x + 1 ≡b(x) 2(x + 3). Therefore we can write a(y) = (x + 3)2y2 + 2(x + 3)y + 1 = ((x + 3)y + 1)2. 10.6 Secret Sharing a) By Lemma 5.32, the polynomial a(x) is uniquely determined by the t values si = a(αi), known to the t generals. Hence, the generals can use the Lagrange’s interpola- tion formula to reconstruct a(x) and the secret code s. b) There are q possibilities for the secret s. Without loss of generality, consider the shares s1, . . . , st−1 of the generals G1, . . . , Gt−1. By Lemma 5.32, for every s ∈ GF(q), there exists a polynomial a(x) of degree at most t − 1, such that a(α1) = s1, . . . , a(αt−1) = st−1 and a(0) = s, which could be the key. Note. This polynomial is unique, so there is a bijection between the secrets s and the possible polyno- mials a(x). Since the polynomial was chosen at random, the secret s is random given the t − 1 shares. 10.7 Structure of Multiplicative Groups of Finite Fields a) (⇒) Assume that d = gcd(a, b). By Deﬁnition 4.2 we have both d | a and d | b. Furthermore, by Corollary 4.5 we can write d = ax + by for some x, y ∈ Z. Dividing both sides of this last equation by d we obtain a d x + b d y = 1 which implies (recall Exercise 7.1) that gcd ( a d , b d ) = 1. (⇐) Assume that both d | a and d | b, and also gcd ( a d , b d ) = 1. By Corollary 4.5 we can write a d x + b d y = 1. Multiplying by d on both sides we obtain ax + by = d. Suppose that for some d′ ∈ Z we have both d′ | a and d′ | b. Then d′k1 = a and d′k2 = b for some k1, k2 ∈ Z. Therefore, we can write d′k1x + d′k2y = d′(k1x + k2y) = d which shows d′ | d. We conclude d = gcd(a, b) (Deﬁnition 4.2). b) We have A(d) = {k ∈ {1, . . . , n} | gcd(k, n) = d} = {k ∈ {1, . . . , n} ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ (d | k) ∧ (d | n) ∧ gcd ( k d , n d ) = 1 } (Subtask a)) = { ℓd ∈ {1, . . . , n} ∣ ∣ ∣ (d | n) ∧ gcd (ℓ, n d ) = 1 } ( Set k d = ℓ ∈ Z ) This means |A(d)| = ∣ ∣ {ℓ ∈ { 1, . . . , n d } ∣ ∣ (d | n) ∧ gcd (ℓ, n d ) = 1 }∣ ∣ = ϕ ( n d ) (Deﬁnitions 5.16 and 5.17). c) Observe that ⋃d|n A(d) = {1, . . . , n} and A(d) ∩ A(d′) = ∅ for all d ̸= d′, that is, the sets A(d) as d ranges over the divisors of n form a partition of [1, n]. This means that n = |{1, . . . , n}| = ∣ ∣ ∣⋃d|n A(d)∣ ∣ ∣ = ∑ d|n |A(d)| = ∑ d|n ϕ ( n d ), where the last equality follows from subtask b) and the second to last from the fact that the sets are disjoint. d) This is simply because as d ranges over the divisors of n so does n d . Let’s prove this formally. Let D(n) denote the set of divisors of n. Consider the map f : D(n) → D(n) that maps d ↦→ n d . First of all, notice that the map is well-deﬁned, because if d | n, then dk = n for some k ∈ Z, which means that n d ∈ Z. Therefore, we can write n = n d d which shows that n d | n. Furthermore, this map is bijective, because for any divisor d of n we can write d = n k = f (k). This shows that f is surjective (and therefore automatically injective). Therefore, we get ∑ d|n ϕ ( n d ) = ∑ {f (d) | d|n} ϕ ( n f (d) ) = ∑ d|n ϕ (d) . By the previous subtask, we conclude that ∑ d|n ϕ (d) = n. e) The polynomial xd − 1 is a polynomial of degree d over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F . By Theorem 5.31 it has at most d roots. Now, observe that if k ∈ B(d) then kd = 1 so that k is a root of xd − 1. Therefore |B(d)| ≤ d. Suppose that B(d) ̸= ∅. Let k ∈ B(d) and consider the cyclic subgroup ⟨k⟩ of F ∗ generated by k. By Theorem 5.7 the number of elements of ⟨k⟩ that has order d is exactly ϕ(d) (all the elements of the form ki with gcd(d, i) = 1). This shows that if B(d) is not empty then |B(d)| ≥ ϕ(d). Now, suppose by contradiction that |B(d)| > ϕ(d). This means that there is y ∈ B(d) such that y /∈ ⟨k⟩. But then the polynomial xd + 1 would have d + 1 roots (namely all elements of ⟨k⟩ in addition to y), a contradiction. This shows that |B(d)| = ϕ(d) whenever B(d) ̸= ∅. f) Again, observe that the union ⋃d∈[1,n] B(d) = ⋃d|n B(d) = F ∗, where the ﬁrst equal- ity follows from Corollary 5.9. Furthermore, if d ̸= d′ then B(d) ∩ B(d′) = ∅ (the order of an element of F ∗ is uniquely deﬁned). We have ∑ d|n ϕ(d) = n = |F ∗| = | ⋃ d|n B(d)| = ∑d|n |B(d)|, where the ﬁrst equality follows from subtask d), and the lasts from the facts that the sets B(d) for distinct d are disjoint. By subtask e) we know that the number of elements of B(d) is either ϕ(d) or 0. Suppose that for some d′ such that d′ | n we have |B(d′)| = 0. Then clearly n = ∑ d|n,d̸=d |B(d)| < ∑ d|n ϕ(d) = n, a contradiction. g) Subtask f) in particular implies that |B(n)| = ϕ(n) > 0 which in turn implies B(n) ̸= ∅, so that there is an element a of order n in F ∗. This shows that F ∗ is cyclic.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
