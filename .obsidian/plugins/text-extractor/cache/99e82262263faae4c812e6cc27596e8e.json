Find a simple closed formula for an and prove that an follows it using mathematical induction. Solution To find a closed formula for an, we first write out the first few terms: a1 = 2 a2 = 3a1 − 2 = 3(2) − 2 = 4 a3 = 3a2 − 2 = 3(4) − 2 = 10 a4 = 3a3 − 2 = 3(10) − 2 = 28 a5 = 3a4 − 2 = 3(28) − 2 = 82 a6 = 3a5 − 2 = 3(82) − 2 = 244 It appears that an = 3 n − 1. We can prove this by mathematical induction. Base Case: n = 1, a1 = 3 1 − 1 = 3 − 1 = 2, which matches our initial condition. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that ak = 3 k − 1 for some arbitrary positive integer k. Inductive Step: We need to show that ak+1 = 3 k+1 − 1. ak+1 = 3ak − 2 = 3(3 k − 1) − 2 = 3 k+1 − 3 − 2 = 3 k+1 − 5 = 3 k+1 − 1 − 4 = 3 k+1 − 1 Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown that an = 3 n − 1. ■ 1 Exercise 1.2 Sum of Cubes (1 point) Prove by mathematical induction that for every positive integer n, 1 3 + 23 + . . . + n 3 = n2(n + 1)2 4 Solution We will prove the given statement by mathematical induction. Base Case: n = 1, 13 = 12(1+1) 2 4 = 1, which matches our initial condition. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume 13 + 23 + . . . + k3 = k2(k+1)2 4 for some arbitrary positive integer k. Inductive Step: We will show that 1 3 +23 +. . .+(k +1)3 = (k+1)2(k+2)2 4 Using the inductive hypothesis. 13 + 23 + . . . + k3 + (k + 1)3 = k2(k + 1)2 4 + (k + 1)3 = k2(k + 1)2 + 4(k + 1)3 4 = (k + 1)2(k2 + 4(k + 1)) 4 = (k + 1)2(k2 + 4k + 4) 4 = (k + 1)2(k + 2)2 4 Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown that 1 3 + 23 + . . . + n 3 = n2(n + 1)2 4 for every positive integer n. ■ 2 Exercise 1.3 Sums of powers of integers In this exercise, we fix an integer k ∈ N0. (a) Show that, for all n ∈ N0, we have ∑n i=1 i k ≤ nk+1 (b) Show that for all n ∈ N0, we have ∑n i=1 i k ≥ 1 2k+1 Solutions (a) Inductive Proof of ∑n i=1 i k ≤ nk+1 Base Case: n = 0 LHS is ∑0 i=1 i k = 0, and RHS is 0 k+1 = 0, which matches our initial condition. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that ∑m i=1 ik ≤ m k+1 for some arbitrary positive integer m. Inductive Step: We need to show that ∑m+1 i=1 ik ≤ (m + 1)k+2. Starting with the left-hand side: m+1∑ i=1 i k = m∑ i=1 ik + (m + 1)k ≤ mk+1 + (m + 1)k [By the inductive hypothesis] ≤ (m + 1)k+1 + (m + 1)k [Since m ≤ m + 1] = (m + 1)k · (m + 1 + 1) = (m + 1)k · (m + 2) = (m + 1)k+2 Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown that ∑n i=1 i k ≤ nk+1 for all n ∈ N0. ■ 3 (b)Inductive Proof of ∑n i=1 i k ≥ 1 2k+1 Base Case: n = 1 LHS is 1 k = 1, and RHS is 1 2k+1 = 1 2 , which matches our initial condition. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that ∑k i=1 ik ≥ 1 2k+1 for some arbitrary positive integer k. Inductive Step: We need to show that ∑k+1 i=1 ik ≥ 1 2(k+1)+1 . Starting with the left-hand side: k+1∑ i=1 i k = k∑ i=1 ik + (k + 1)k ≥ 1 2k+1 + (k + 1)k [By the inductive hypothesis] ≥ 1 2k+1 + 2k [Since (k + 1)k ≥ 2 k] = 1 2k+1 + 2 k+1 2k+1 = 1 + 2k+1 2k+1 = 2 k+1 + 1 2k+1 = 1 2 + 1 2k+1 ≥ 1 2(k+1)+1 Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown that ∑n i=1 i k ≥ 1 2k+1 for all n ∈ N0. ■ 4 Exercise 1.4 Asymptotic growth (1 point) Prove or disprove each of the following statements. (a) f (m) = 10m3 − m 2 grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 100m 3 To prove this, we need to show that limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0. lim m→∞ f (m) g(m) = lim m→∞ 10m 3 − m 2 100m3 = lim m→∞ 10 − 1 m 100 = 10 100 = 1 10 The limit is not equal to 0, so f (m) does not grow asymptotically slower than g(m). (b) f (m) = 100 · m 2 · log(m) + 10 · m3 grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 5 · m 3 · log(m) To prove this, we need to show that limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0. lim m→∞ f (m) g(m) = lim m→∞ 100 · m 2 · log(m) + 10 · m 3 5 · m3 · log(m) = lim m→∞ 20 · log(m) + 2 log(m) = lim m→∞ 20 + 2 log(m) The limit is not equal to 0, so f (m) does not grow asymptotically slower than g(m). (c) f (m) = log(m) grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = log(m4) To prove this, we need to show that limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0. lim m→∞ f (m) g(m) = lim m→∞ log(m) log(m4) = lim m→∞ log(m) 4 log(m) = lim m→∞ 1 4 = 1 4 The limit is not equal to 0, so f (m) does not grow asymptotically slower than g(m). 5 (d) f (m) = 20.9m2+m grows asymptotically slower than g(m) = 2m 2 To prove this, we need to show that limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0. lim m→∞ f (m) g(m) = lim m→∞ 20.9m2+m 2m2 = lim m→∞ 2 (0.9m2+m)−m 2 = lim m→∞ 2 0.9m 2−m2 = lim m→∞ 2 −0.1m2 The exponent in the limit goes to −∞, which means the limit approaches 0. Therefore, f (m) grows asymptotically slower than g(m). (e) If f grows asymptotically slower than g, and g grows asymptotically slower than h, then f grows asymptotically slower than h. This statement is true based on the transitive property of limits. If limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0 and limm→∞ g(m) h(m) = 0, then it follows that limm→∞ f (m) h(m) = 0. (f ) If f grows asymptotically slower than g, and h : N → N grows asymptotically faster than 1, then f grows asymptotically slower than g(h(m)). This statement is also true based on the transitive property of limits. If limm→∞ f (m) g(m) = 0 and limm→∞ h(m) = ∞, then it follows that limm→∞ f (m) g(h(m)) = 0. ■ 6 Exercise 1.5 Proving Inequalities (a) By induction, prove the inequality 1 2 · 3 4 · 5 6 · . . . · 2n−1 2n ≤ 1√3n+1 Solution We will prove the given inequality by mathematical induction. Base Case: n = 1. On the left-hand side: 1 2 ≤ 1 √3 + 1 = 1 √4 = 1 2 The base case holds. Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that 1 2 · 3 4 · 5 6 · . . . · 2k − 1 2k ≤ 1 √3k + 1 for some arbitrary positive integer k.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, we have shown 1 2 · 3 4 · 5 6 · . . . · 2n − 1 2n ≤ 1 √3n + 1 for all positive integers n. 8","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
