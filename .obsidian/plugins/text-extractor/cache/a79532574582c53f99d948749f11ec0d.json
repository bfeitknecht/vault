Since the limit is zero, f ≤ O(g). □ (b) This gives f = n10 − 10n9 − 100n8 and g = 1000n7. We compute the limit to determine the asymptotic relation. n5 + 4n4 ≤ O ( n6 5 ) lim n→∞ f(n) g(n) = lim n→∞ n5 + 4n4 n6 5 = lim n→∞ (1 + 4 n ) n 5 = lim n→∞ n+4 n n 5 = lim n→∞ 5n + 20 n2 l’Hôpital = lim n→∞ 5 2n = 0 n5 n5 n10 − 10n9 − 100n8 ≤ O (1000n7) Since the numerator approaches inﬁnity and the denominator is constant, the limit is equal to inﬁnity and thus f ≰ O(g) but g ≤ O(f). □ (c) The functions are f = 22n and g = en. We again take the limit. Since the limit approaches inﬁnity, f ≰ O(g) but g ≤ O(f). □ (d) We deﬁne f = n 6n+10 3n+2 and g = n3. To determine the asymptotic relation, we compute the limit.

Obviously, f ≤ O(n), for C = 2. However, ef(n) ≰ O(en). □ (b) The direction of the implications is incorrect, ef(n) ≤ O(en) ⟹ f(n) ≤ O(n), but f(n) ≤ O(n) /⟹ ef(n) ≤ O(en). Speciﬁcally in the ﬁnal step (4), our friend falsly denotes that f(n) ≤ O(n)  ! ⟺ f(n) ≤ log C + n. Per deﬁnition 1, we know that f(n) ≤ O(n) ⟺ f(n) ≤ C ⋅ n. The last step should only have the implication in the ⟹ direction, as the other direction is wrong as shown here. □ 2.3 (a) We assume n! ≤ 2n. Let n = 4, so n! = 24 and 2n = 16, however 24 ! ≥ 16. This is a contradiction and thus the statement is disproven. □ (b) In the inductive step (5) our friend incorrectly upperbounds the RHS. The proof takes the following steps. Speciﬁcally, the RHS inequalities must all be true for all values of n ≥ 1 to apply transitivity and conclude with the inductive hypothesis. However, for n ≥ 3, the inequality n! ≥ 2n+1 n+1 doesn't hold. Thus the proof is wrong, as was to be shown. □ (n + 1)! ≤ 2n+1 n! ⋅ (n + 1) ≤ 2n+1 n! ≤ 2n+1 n + 1 ≤ 2n n! ! ≤IH 2n","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
