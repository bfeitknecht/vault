Thus, trivially 1 ∈ Z. However, on the LHS we have 1 ∉ (( 2 ) ∪ ( 3 ) ). Hence ( a) ∪ ( b) ≠ ( gcd( a, b) ) . □ b) True. We prove this via double set inclusion. First, we show that ( lcm( a, b) ) ⊆ ( a) ∩ ( b) . Let y ∈ ( lcm( a, b) ) . Then y = k ⋅ lcm( a, b) , for some k ∈ Z. Per deﬁnition of lcm, this is a multiple of a and b. Since ( a) ∩ ( b) is exactly the set of all multiples of both a and b, we have y ∈ ( a) ∩ ( b) . Formally, we write this as follows. Then we show that ( a) ∩ ( b) ⊆ ( lcm( a, b) ) . Let x ∈ ( a) ∩ ( b) . Then x is a multiple of both a and b, i.e. there exists integers u, v ∈ Z such that x = ua and x = vb. Since x is a multiple of a and b, it must also be a multiple of their least common multiple, by deﬁnition of lcm. Then there exists an integer k ∈ Z such that x = k ⋅ lcm( a, b) . Thus we have x ∈ ( lcm( a, b) ) . Formally we denote this with the below. Since we have shown that both ( lcm( a, b) ) ⊆ ( a) ∩ ( b) and ( a) ∩ ( b) ⊆ ( lcm( a, b) ) hold, we have proven that ( a) ∩ ( b) = ( lcm( a, b) ) . □ ( lcm( a, b) ) ⊆ ( a) ∩ ( b) ( def. ideal) {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ⊆ {ua ∣ u ∈ Z} ∩ {vb ∣ v ∈ Z} ( def. ∩ ) {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ⊆ {x ∣ u, v ∈ Z : x = ua ∧ x = vb} ( def.  | ) {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ⊆ {x ∣ a|x ∧ b|x} ( def. ⊆ , def. lcm) ∀x((x = kl ∧ a|l ∧ b|l ∧ ∀m( ( a|m ∧ b|m) → l|m) ) → (a|x ∧ b|x)) ( def.  | ) ∀x((a|x ∧ b|x ∧ ∀m( ( a|m ∧ b|m) → l|m) ) → (a|x ∧ b|x)) ( F ∧ G ⊨ F ) ∀x(( a|x ∧ b|x) → ( a|x ∧ b|x) ) ≡ ⊤ ( F → F ≡ ⊤ ) ( a) ∩ ( b) ⊆ ( lcm( a, b) ) ( def. ideal) {ua ∣ u ∈ Z} ∩ {vb ∣ v ∈ Z} ⊆ {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ( def. ∩ ) {x ∣ u, v ∈ Z : x = ua ∧ x = vb} ⊆ {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ( def.  | ) {x ∣ a|x ∧ b|x} ⊆ {k ⋅ lcm( a, b) ∣ k ∈ Z} ( def. ⊆ ) ∀x(( a|x ∧ b|x) → (x = kl ∧ a|l ∧ b|l ∧ ∀m( ( a|m ∧ b|m) → l|m)) ( def.  | ) ∀x(( a|x ∧ b|x) → (a|x ∧ b|x ∧ ∀m( ( a|m ∧ b|m) → l|m)) ( F ∧ G ⊨ F ) ∀x(( a|x ∧ b|x) → ( a|x ∧ b|x) ) ≡ ⊤ ( F → F ≡ ⊤ )","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
