Provide an as good as possible upper bound on the Kolmogorov complexity of wn, expressed in terms of the length of wn. (b) Provide an infinite sequence of words y0 < y1 < y2 < · · · such that there exists a constant c ∈ N such that, for all i ∈ N, K(yi) ≤ log2 log3(|yi|) + c . 10 points Task 5 Let n ∈ N. Show that the Kolmogorov complexity of more than 99% of the words in {0, 1}n is greater than n − 8. 10 points Task 6 Show that there is no Pascal program which takes as input an arbitrary n ∈ N and then prints some w ∈ {0, 1}n with K(w) > n − 8. 10 points Submission: On Friday, October 4, 2024, by 11:15 at the latest, as a legible PDF via the Moodle platform.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
