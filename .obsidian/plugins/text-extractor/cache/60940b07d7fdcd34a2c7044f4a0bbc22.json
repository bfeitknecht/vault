FROM ... WHERE • Aggregation • Subquery • NULL • Views • … • Can you construct a query that we cannot answer using what we have learned so far? Q: Return ALL ancestors of D Recursion - Integrity Constraints 4 Limitation of SQL Queries • How is answering this query hard? • There does not exist one single SQL query that works for all possible DB instances -- we don't know how many generations this DB contains. Q: Return ALL ancestors of D SELECT parent FROM ParentOf WHERE child = D; Parent C SELECT p2.parent as grandparent FROM ParentOf p1, ParentOf p2 WHERE p1.child = D AND p1.parent = p2.child Grandparent B SELECT p3.parent as greatgrandparent FROM ParentOf p1, ParentOf p2, ParentOf p3 WHERE p1.child = D AND p1.parent = p2.child AND p2.parent = p1.child; GreatGrandparent A Recursion - Integrity Constraints 5 Limitation of SQL Queries • How is answering this query hard? • There does not exist one single SQL query that works for all possible DB instances -- we don't know how many hops this DB contains.

See the following example: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/497c44/1 Recursion - Integrity Constraints 24 KEY Constraints • A certain attribute needs to be (1) unique and (2) not NULL. • Can define PRIMARY KEY over multiple attributes. • But you can only define ONE PRIMARY KEY per relation. CREATE TABLE Student (sID int, sName text, GPA real PRIMARY KEY (sID, sName) ); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, NULL, 2); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 2, 2); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 2, 2); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 3, 2); Tricky: The “combination” needs to be unique; all attributes need to be NOT NULL. Recursion - Integrity Constraints 25 UNIQUE Constraints - Attributes CREATE TABLE Student (sID int PRIMARY KEY sName text UNIQUE, GPA real); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (NULL, 1, 2); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, NULL, 2); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, NULL, 3); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (4, 1, 3); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (3, 1, 2); Tricky: Different from Primary Key, UNIQUE can be NULL. Recursion - Integrity Constraints 26 UNIQUE Constraints - Attributes CREATE TABLE Student (sID int, sName text, GPA real UNIQUE (sID, sName) UNIQUE (Sid, GPA) ); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (NULL, NULL, NULL); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (NULL, NULL, NULL); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (NULL, NULL, NULL); Tricky: UNIQUE columns can have multiple NULLs. Recursion - Integrity Constraints 27 CHECK Constraints • One can also conduct local checking of the value of attributes. • (Local in the sense that you take as input a tuple and check whether it satisfies some constraints) CREATE TABLE Student (sID int PRIMARY KEY sName text, GPA real, semester int, check((GPA <= 4.0 and GPA > 0.0) OR (semester <20 and semester > 0))); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 1, 1.2, 5); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (2, 1, 5, 5); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (3, 1, 1.2, 20); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (4, 1, NULL,5); sID, sName, GPA, Sem. Recursion - Integrity Constraints 28 CHECK Constraints • One can also conduct local checking of the value of attributes. • Corner case: CHECK accepts Unknown & True (Only reject False) CREATE TABLE Student ( sID int, sName text, GPA real, semester int, check (NULL IS NOT NULL) ); CREATE TABLE Student ( sID int, sName text, GPA real, semester int, check (NULL = NULL) );=> False => Unknown Reject ALL inputs Accept ALL inputs http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/47723/1 Recursion - Integrity Constraints 29 CHECK Constraints • One can also conduct local checking of the value of attributes. • Check what happens at tuple level. CREATE TABLE Student (sID int, sName text, GPA real, semester int, check (GPA + semester = 10) ); INSERT INTO Student VALUES (1, 1, 5, 5); UPDATE Student SET GPA = GPA - 1; UPDATE Student SET GPA = GPA - 1, semester = semester +1; sID, sName, GPA, Sem. Recursion - Integrity Constraints 30 CHECK Constraints • You can also conduct local checking of the value of attributes. • Not all DB engines care about CHECK equally. • When something weird happens, Google it! (it might not be your fault) • http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/08c040/1 • https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=3464 • In principle, CHECK could be more powerful, but most systems do not allow it • E.g., most systems do not allow subqueries (also, in exam we assume no subqueries in check) • E.g., you cannot do these two queries in most systems. CREATE TABLE T ( A int check (A not in (SELECT A from T)) ); CREATE TABLE T ( A int check ( (SELECT count(distinct A) from T) = (SELECT count(*) from T) ); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 31 ER Diagram is a (Graphical) Constraint Language ∀𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐: 𝑅 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 ⇒ 𝐴 𝑎 ∧ 𝐵 𝑏 ∧ 𝐶(𝑐) ∀𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐: 𝑅 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 ⇒ ¬∃𝑐′.

Recursion - Integrity Constraints 32 REFERENTIAL Constraints • Foreign Keys. • Refer to tuple from a different relation • PersNr in Lecture refers to a Professor • PersNr cannot take a value that does not correspond to a Professor • Definition • For every foreign key one of the following two conditions much hold: • The value of the foreing key is NULL • the referenced tuple must exist INSERT INTO attends VALUES (1, NULL); INSERT INTO attends VALUES (NULL, NULL); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 33 REFERENTIAL Constraints • Foreign Keys. • Refer to tuple from a different relation • PersNr in Lecture refers to a Professor • PersNr cannot take a value that does not correspond to a Professor • We can define in SQL DDL. • S.ka references R.a • S.ka is called “foreign key” • R.a is usually required to be primary key, or at least unique. CREATE TABLE R (a integer primary key, b varchar(30) unique); CREATE TABLE S (..., ka integer references R); CREATE TABLE T (..., kb varchar(30) references R(b)); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 34 REFERENTIAL Constraints • Foreign Keys. • There are implementation-dependent caveats. CREATE TABLE R (a integer primary key, b varchar(30) unique); CREATE TABLE S (..., ka integer references R); CREATE TABLE T (..., kb varchar(30) references R(b)); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 35 ▪ What if we delete Student with Legi = 24002. ▪ What if we delete Lecture with Title = \"Database\". REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance Recursion - Integrity Constraints 36 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance • Different actions in SQL 2003: • Cascade • Propagate update or delete • Restrict • Prevent deletion of the primary key before trying to do the change, cause an error • No Action • Prevent modifications after attempting the change, cause an error • Set default, set null: • Set references to NULL or to a default value Recursion - Integrity Constraints 37 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance Cascade • Propagate update or delete Cascade Recursion - Integrity Constraints 38 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance Restrict • Prevent deletion of the primary key before trying to do the change, cause an error Restrict Throw Error Recursion - Integrity Constraints 39 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance • No Action • Prevent modifications after attempting the change, cause an error No Action Throw Error Recursion - Integrity Constraints 40 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance • Set default, set null: • Set references to NULL or to a default value SET NULL NULL NULL Recursion - Integrity Constraints 41 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance • Different actions in SQL 2003: • Cascade • Propagate update or delete • Restrict • Prevent deletion of the primary key before trying to do the change, cause an error • No Action • Prevent modifications after attempting the change, cause an error • Set default, set null: • Set references to NULL or to a default value create table Lecture ( ..., PersNr integer references Professor on delete {cascade | restrict | no action | set null | set default} on update {cascade | restrict | no action | set null | set default} ); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 42 REFERENTIAL Constraints: Maintainance • Restrict vs. No Action • Very subtle, in many DBMS, no different at all. • In principle: • Restrict: throw error immediately • No Action: throw error after trying • One example difference in SQLite – when you have a transaction (think about transaction as a “group” of queries between BEGIN/COMMIT).

CREATE TABLE Employee (emp_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE); CREATE TABLE Office (room varchar(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE); CREATE TABLE HasOffice (emp_id VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES Employee (emp_id), room VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES Office (room) ); Recursion - Integrity Constraints 49 Lessons learned • We have seen two important concepts • Recursion as an example of an operation that is difficult in the relational model and needs to be solved with some syntactic sugar (and an expensive implementation) • Integrity constraints as a mechanism to protect the data from errors in data entry and data manipulation. • Enforcing the semantics of a schema • Enforcing cardinality constraints • Make sure data is consistent Recursion - Integrity Constraints 50","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
