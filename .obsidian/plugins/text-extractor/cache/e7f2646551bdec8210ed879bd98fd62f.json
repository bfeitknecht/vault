The solution to this exercise must be your own work. You may not share your solutions with anyone else. See also the note on dishonest behavior on the course website: https://crypto.ethz.ch/ teaching/DM23/. 11.1 Error-Correcting Codes (⋆ ⋆) Let C ⊆ GF(q)n be a code that forms a group with element-wise addition (such a code is also called linear). Let d(c1, c2) denote the Hamming distance between two codewords c1, c2 ∈ C. Moreover, let hw(c) denote the Hamming weight (i.e., the number of non-zero positions) of a codeword c ∈ C. Assume that there exists t ∈ N such that min c∈C\\{0n} hw(c) = 2t + 1. a) Prove that C is t-error correcting. b) Is it possible that there exists a codeword c ∈ C such that up to t + 1 arbitrary errors can be corrected if the codeword c is sent? 11.2 Proof Systems (⋆ ⋆) a) Prove or disprove the following statement: For any non-empty sets S and P, and any function ϕ : S × P → {0, 1}, there exists a unique function τ : S → {0, 1} such that Π = (S, P, τ, ϕ) is a sound and complete proof system. b) Let Π1 = (S1, P1, τ1, ϕ1) and Π2 = (S2, P2, τ2, ϕ2) be two proof systems. We combine Π1 and Π2 into a third proof system Π3 = (S1 × S2, P1 × P2, τ3, ϕ3), where τ3(s1, s2) = 1 def ⇐⇒ τ1(s1) = 1 or τ2(s2) = 1, and ϕ3((s1, s2), (p1, p2)) = 1 def ⇐⇒ ϕ1(s1, p1) = 1 or ϕ2(s2, p2) = 1. Prove or disprove each of the following statements: (i) If Π3 is sound, then Π1 or Π2 is sound. (ii) If Π1 or Π2 is complete, then Π3 is complete. 11.3 Difﬁe-Hellman Proof System (⋆ ⋆) Alice and Bob execute the Difﬁe-Hellman protocol, using a cyclic group G = ⟨g⟩ of order n. Consider the set of statements S = G3 and the truth function τ deﬁned as follows: τ (yA, yB, kAB) = 1 def ⇐⇒ kAB is the secret key resulting from exchanging the public keys yA and yB. Let P = Zn. Deﬁne ϕ : S × P → {0, 1}, such that Π = (S, P, τ, ϕ) is a complete and sound proof system. Prove your answer. 11.4 One More Proof System (⋆) (8 Points) Let Σ = (S, P, τ, ϕ) be a proof system. Consider the proof system Σ = (S, P, τ , ϕ), where for all s ∈ S and p ∈ P we deﬁne τ (s) = 1 ⇐⇒ τ (s) = 0, ϕ(s, p) = 1 ⇐⇒ ϕ(s, p) = 0. (1) Prove or disprove the following statements. a) If Σ is sound, then Σ is complete. b) If Σ is complete, then Σ is sound. 11.5 Homer’s Birthday (⋆ ⋆) Homer wants to organize a birthday party. He would like to invite as many friends as possible. The problem is that everything is always so difﬁcult. . . Homer wants to invite Abe. But if Abe comes, then Barney comes as well. This is not a problem yet, but if Barney comes, then Carl has to come too. And if Carl comes, Disco Stu also certainly arrives. However, if both Barney and Disco Stu come, then Carl surely doesn’t come. Finally, if Disco Stu comes, then at least one of Abe and Barney comes. Homer does not know whether anyone would eventually come to the party. Perhaps it would be better to simply go to Moe’s right away? a) Formalize the above conditions, using propositional formulas. Argue (intuitively) whether Homer should buy beer and donuts for the party or go straight to Moe’s. b) Using the following derivation rules, derive formally the answer to Subtask a). {F → G, G → H} ⊢R1 F → H {F → G, F → ¬G} ⊢R2 ¬F {F → (G ∨ H), G → H} ⊢R3 F → H {F → G} ⊢R4 F → (G ∧ F ) {F → G, ¬G} ⊢R5 ¬F 11.6 Models and Satisﬁability (⋆) a) Determine the sets of models of the formulas F and G. Then, decide whether F and G are equivalent or if one is a consequence of the other. F = (¬A ∨ B) ∧ (B → (¬C ∧ ¬A)) ∧ (A ∨ C) G = ¬(A → B) ∨ (C → A) b) Prove or disprove: Two formulas of propositional logic that have no common atomic formulas are not equivalent. c) Prove or disprove: If F and G are formulas such that F and F → G are satisﬁable, then G is also satisﬁable. 11.7 Satisﬁability (⋆) For each set of formulas, either ﬁnd a model or show that it is unsatisﬁable. a) M = {¬A, B ∧ C, ¬A → ¬C} b) N = {A1 ∨ A2, ¬A2 ∨ A3, ¬A3 ∨ A4, . . .} Due by 7.
