Let X be a random variable with the distribution function F (a) =    0, a < 0, a 2 , 0 ≤ a < 1, 2 3 , 1 ≤ a < 2, a+1 4 , 2 ≤ a < 3, 1, 3 ≤ a. (a) Plot this distribution function. (b) Determine the following probabilities: P[X < 1], P[X = 2], P[X = 3], P[1 < X ≤ 2], P[1 ≤ X < 2] and P[X ≥ 3/2]. Exercise 3.6. [Riemann zeta function] Let X be a discrete random variable with values in N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}. The distribution of X is given by P[X = n] = n−s ζ(s) , n ∈ N, where s > 1 is a parameter of the distribution, and ζ(s) = ∑∞ n=1 n−s denotes the Riemann zeta function. For a number m ∈ N, we define the event Em as {X is divisible by m without remainder}, or equivalently, {There exists a k ∈ N such that X = km}. (a) Show that P[Em] = m −s for all m ∈ N. (b) Let p and q be two distinct prime numbers. Show that Ep and Eq are independent. Hint: A number n is divisible by two different prime numbers p and q if and only if n is divisible by pq. (c) Determine P [ ⋂ p prime Ec p]. Exercise 3.7. [First six] Two players, Anja and Beatrice, take turns rolling a (fair) die until a six appears. Anja starts rolling. The player who rolls the first six wins the game. Determine the probabilities of winning for both players. Exercise 3.8. [Construction of random variables] The goal of this problem is to construct random variables from a sequence of independent coin flips. Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space, and let (Xi)i≥1 be an infinite sequence of independent, Bernoulli(1/2)-distributed random variables. We consider the following algorithm: i := 1 while (Xi = Xi+1 = 1) : i := i + 2 Z := Xi + 2 × Xi+1 return Z (a) Show that the algorithm always terminates after a finite number of steps with probability 1. (b) Show that Z is a uniformly distributed random variable in {0, 1, 2}. (c) [Bonus] Provide an algorithm that outputs a Bernoulli(1/5)-distributed random variable. 2","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
