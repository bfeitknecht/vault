Using equivalences 2), 11), 2) and 9), one can find a simpler formula equivalent to G, also in CNF: (¬A ∨ ¬B) ∧ (C ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ ¬B) ∧ (D ∨ A) ∧ (D ∨ ¬B). 12.2 Free Variables i) ∀x∀y (P (x, y) ∨ P (x, z)) ii) (∀x (∃x P (x) ∧ P (x)) ∨ P (x)) In the first occurence of P (x), x is bound by ∃x and in the second occurrence it is bound by ∀x. iii) There are no free variables in this formula. 12.3 Interpretations a) i) A is a model for F , because for all positive natural numbers x, y, z we have: x | xy ∧ y | xy ∧ (y ∤ x → yz ∤ x). ii) A is not a model for F , because there exist positive natural numbers x, y, z, for which the following does not hold: x | xy ∧ y | x y ∧ (y ∤ x → yz ∤ x). The counterexample is x = 2, y = 3 (note that y ∤ xy). iii) A is a model for F , because for all subsets A, B, C of N we have: A ∩ B ⊆ A ∧ A ∩ B ⊆ B ∧ (A ̸⊆ B → A ̸⊆ B ∩ C). b) There are many correct solutions. Below we give an example. i) The structure A that defines only the universe: U A = {0}. ii) The structure A with U A = {0} and P A(0, 0) = 0. A is not a model, because ∀x∃y P (x, y) is false (since P (x, y) is always false). iii) The structure A with U A = Z3 and P A(x, y) = 1 if and only if x + 1 ≡3 y. A is a model for G, because (1) for any x there exists a y = R3(x+1) such that x+1 ≡3 y and similarly for any y there exists an x = R3(y − 1) such that x + 1 ≡3 y, and (2) if x + 1 ≡3 y then y + 1 ≡3 x + 2 ̸≡3 x. 12.4 Predicate Logic with Equality a) An interpretation A is a model for F if and only if ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ = 1. If ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ = 1, then clearly for all elements x, y of the universe, we have x = y and A is a model for F . On the other hand, if U A contains at least two different elements, then A is not a model, because there exists x and y such that ¬(x = y). b) An interpretation A is a model for G if and only if ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ > 1. If ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ > 1, then there exist two different elements x, y of the universe and A is a model for G. On the other hand, if ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ = 1, then A is not a model, because for all x, y, we have x = y. c) An example of such formula H is ∃x∃y∃z(¬(x = y) ∧ ¬(y = z) ∧ ¬(x = z) ). If ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ ≥ 3, then there exist three different elements x, y, z of the universe. These elements satisfy ¬(x = y) ∧ ¬(y = z) ∧ ¬(x = z). If ∣ ∣U A∣ ∣ < 3, then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two among three elements chosen from the universe must be equal. Hence, at least one of ¬(x = y), ¬(y = z) and ¬(x = z) must be false and A(H) = 0. 12.5 Statements About Formulas a) The statement is true. Proof. Let A be any interpretation suitable for both ∀x (F ∧ G) and (∀x F ) ∧ G, such that A (∀x (F ∧ G)) = 1. According to the semantics of ∀, we have A[x→u](F ∧ G) = 1 for all u ∈ U . According to the semantics of ∧, we further have (1) A[x→u](F ) = 1 for all u ∈ U and (2) A[x→u](G) = 1 for all u ∈ U . The fact (1) implies (3) A(∀x F ) = 1, according to the semantics of ∀. Furthermore, note that if x appears free in G, then it also appears free in (∀x F ) ∧ G, and since A is suitable for (∀x F ) ∧ G, it must assign a value to x. We now define u∗ as follows: if x appears free in G, then u∗ is the value assigned to x by A, else u∗ is arbitrary. By the definition of u∗, we have A[x→u∗](G) = A(G), so by (2), we have (4) A(G) = 1. The facts (3) and (4) imply that A ((∀x F ) ∧ G) = 1. b) The statement is false. Counterexample. Let F = P (x) and G = Q(x). Let A be the interpretation with the universe U A = {0, 1}, which defines: • P A(0) = 1 and P A(1) = 1 • QA(0) = 1 and QA(1) = 0 • xA = 1 We then have A(∃x (P (x) ∧ Q(x))) = 1, because A[x→0](P (x) ∧ Q(x)) = 1. However, A((∃x P (x)) ∧ Q(x)) = 0, because A(Q(x)) = 0. 12.6 Semantics of Predicate Logic a) Let A be an interpretation which is suitable both for ∃x ∀y P (x, y) and for ∃xP (x, f (x)), and such that A is a model for ∃x ∀y P (x, y), meaning A(∃x ∀y P (x, y)) = 1. In par- ticular, observe that f A : U A → U A is defined. We have A(∃x ∀y P (x, y)) = 1 · ⇐⇒A[x→u](∀y P (x, y)) = 1 for some u ∈ U A (Semantics of ∃) · ⇐⇒A[x→u][y→v](P (x, y)) = 1 for some u ∈ U A and all v ∈ U A (Semantics of ∀) · =⇒A[x→u][y→f A(u)](P (x, y)) = 1 for some u ∈ U A (f A(u) ∈ U A) · ⇐⇒A[x→u](P (x, f (x))) = 1 for some u ∈ U A (Semantics of f (x)) · ⇐⇒A(∃x P (x, f (x))) = 1. (Semantics of ∃) (1) b) Let A be an interpretation which is suitable both for ¬(∀x P (x)) and for ∃x ¬P (x), and such that A is a model for ¬(∀x P (x)), meaning A(¬(∀x P (x))) = 1. We have A(¬(∀x P (x))) = 1 · ⇐⇒A(∀x P (x)) = 0 (Semantics of ¬) · ⇐⇒A[x→u](P (x)) = 0 for some u ∈ U A (∗) · ⇐⇒A[x→u](¬P (x)) = 1 for some u ∈ U A (Semantics of ¬) · ⇐⇒A(∃x ¬P (x)) = 1. (Semantics of ∃) (2) • (∗) If for all assignments of the variable x it holds that A[x→u](P (x)) = 1, then by the semantics of ∀ we get A(∀x P (x))) = 1, a contradiction.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
