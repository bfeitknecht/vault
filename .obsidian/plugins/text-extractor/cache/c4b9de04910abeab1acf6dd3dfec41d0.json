Exercise Session Logistics ● CHN F42 ● Monday, 09:15-11.00 (Session) ● Website for slides: https://n.ethz.ch/~ahmala/and/ ● Groups of 2 or 3 (changes in every three weeks) ● New exercise sheet every monday, submitted on Moodle ● Deadline for Exercise Sheet 1 is next Sunday 23:59. ● Only today no peer grading ● 11:00 - 12:00 can be used for peer grading. Homeworks (theoretical part)In-Class Quizes ● First time this year ● Starting next week ● 09:15 - 09:30 ● Contributes to bonus points ● Online participation possible Point Distribution ● 12 * {Weekly theoretical exercise sheet (3 points) + peer grading(1 points)} [In Groups] ● 12 * In-class quiz (1 points) ● 5 * {Code Expert programming tasks(biweekly) (6 points)} [Individual] ● min(0.25, 0.25 * n_points / (0.8 * max_points)) ● 0.25 bonus for 80% of full possible points Content of Today ● Induction Proofs ● Comparing functions When will all dominoes fall?When will all dominoes fall? ● First domino falls ● Each domino knocks over the next Induction Proofs ● Base Case(usually n=1): Show, the statement holds for n=1 ● Induction Hypothesis(n=k): Assume the statement holds for n=k ● Induction Step(usually n=k+1): Show, the statement also holds for n=k+1 ● (usually) By the principle of mathematical induction, this is true for any positive integer n.
