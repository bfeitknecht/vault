For notational convenience let S ′ = S × S × S = {s′ = (s1, s2, s3) ∣ s1, s2, s2 ∈ S} denote the set of triples of statements si ∈ Sconsidered in this proof system. Then we show that the described proof system Σ′ is sound and complete. Trivially the veriﬁcation function is eﬃciently computable. First, let's cover its soundness. Assume for some statement s′ ∈ S ′ there exists a valid proof p′ ∈ P ′ with ϕ′(s′, p′) = 1. Then, by deﬁnition of the veriﬁcation function (a), in the proof system Σ two of the statements in s′ = (s1, s2, s3) can be veriﬁed by one of the two proofs in p′ = (p1, p2). Note that these are not necessarily distinct, however this does not aﬀect the result. Since Σ is sound, two statements si1, si2 ∈ S having a valid proof pj1, pj2 ∈ P such that ϕ(si1, pj1), ϕ(si2, pj2) = 1 implies that the statements are true, i.e. τ(si1), τ(si2) = 1. Thus it follows that τ ′(s′) = 1, by deﬁnition of Σ′. Then every statement with a valid proof is true and hence the proof system is sound. Now to show that it is also complete. Let s′ ∈ S ′ be an arbitrary true statement i.e. τ ′(s′) = 1. Thus, by deﬁnition (a) at least two statements in s′ = (s1, s2, s3) are true with τ(si1), τ(si2) = 1. Since Σ is complete, every true statement has a valid proof. Let p′ = (pj1, pj2) ∈ P ′ be a pair of valid proofs such that ϕ(si1, pj1), ϕ(si2, pj2) = 1. Then it follows that ϕ′(s′, p′) = 1. Thus every true statement has a valid proof so Σ′ is complete. □ P ′ = P × P ϕ′(s′, p′) = 1 ⟺ ϕ(si, pj) = 1 for two distinct i1, i2 ∈ [3] where p′ = (p1, p2) (a) b) Let the set of proofs P ∗ and the veriﬁcation function ϕ∗ : S × P ∗ → {0, 1} be deﬁned as given below. Proof that Σ∗ is correct and complete. Let's start with the former. Assume for some s1 ∈ S there exists a valid proof p∗ ∈ P ∗ such that ϕ∗(s1, p∗) = 1. By assumption it must hold that both conditions in the RHS of deﬁnition (b) are satisﬁed. Thus we have ϕ(s2, p) = 1 ⟺ τ(s2) = 1, since Σ is sound. Furthermore, ϕ((s1, s2), –p) ⟺ –τ(s1, s2) = 1 as Σ is also sound. By deﬁnition (1) of the proof system Σ, it must be that τ(s1) = 0, since exactly one of the statements can be true in Σ and it's established that τ(s2) = 1. Thus it follows that for any statement s1 ∈ S for which there exists p∗ ∈ P ∗ with ϕ∗(s1, p∗) = 1 it holds that τ ∗(s1) = 1 ⟺ τ(s1) = 0. Hence Σ∗ is sound. Now let's cover the latter. Assume τ ∗(s1) = 1 ⟺ τ(s1) = 0 for an arbitrary s1 ∈ S. Under the assumption that there exists some statement s2 ∈ S with τ(s2) = 1 there exists a valid proof for it p ∈ P such that ϕ(s2, p) = 1, since Σ is complete,. Additionally, since the proof system Σ is also complete, for some true statement in it, i.e. (s1, s2) ∈ S 2 with, –τ(s1, s2) = 1 there exists a valid proof –p ∈ P for it such that ϕ((s1, s2), –p) = 1. Thus, for an arbitrary true statement s1 ∈ S in the proof system Σ∗, there exists a valid proof p∗ = ((s2, p), –p) ∈ P ∗ which satisﬁes ϕ∗(s1, p∗) = 1 by construction as above. In the case where ∃ ̸s2 ∈ S such that τ(s2) = 1, then by deﬁnition there are only true statements in the proof system Σ∗. Thus the veriﬁcation function accepts any proof for any statement s1 ∈ S. Again, since every true statement in Σ∗ has a proof, it is complete. Under the assumption that this condition is given or can be eﬃciently computed, the veriﬁcation function is eﬃciently computable. □ P ∗ = (S × P) × P ϕ∗(s1, p∗) = 1 ⟺ ϕ(s2, p) = 1 and ϕ((s1, s2), –p) = 1 for p∗ = ((s2, p), –p) (b)––– – ––––","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
