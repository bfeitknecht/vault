For notational convenience let S ′ = S × S × S = {s ′ = (s1, s2, s3) ∣ s1, s2, s2 ∈ S} denote the set of triples of statements si ∈ Sconsidered in this proof system. Then we show that the described proof system Σ ′ is sound and copmlete. First, let's cover its soundness. Assume for some statement s ′ ∈ S ′ there exists a valid proof p ′ ∈ P ′ with ϕ ′(s ′, p ′) = 1. Then, by deﬁnition of the veriﬁcation function (a), in the proof system Σ two of the statements in s ′ = (s1, s2, s3) can be veriﬁed by one of the two proofs in p ′ = (p1, p2). Note that these are not necessarily distinct, however this does not aﬀect the result. Since Σ is sound, two statements si1, si2 ∈ S having a valid proof pj1, pj2 ∈ P such that ϕ(si1, pj1), ϕ(si2, pj2) = 1 implies that the statements are true, i.e. τ(si1), τ(si2) = 1. Thus it follows that τ ′(s ′) = 1, by deﬁnition of Σ ′. Then every statement with a valid proof is true and hence the proof system is sound. Now to show that it is also complete. Let s ′ ∈ S ′ be an arbitrary true statement i.e. τ ′(s ′) = 1. Thus, by deﬁnition (a) at least two statements in s ′ = (s1, s2, s3) are true with τ(si1), τ(si2) = 1. Since Σ is complete, every true statement has a valid proof. Let p ′ = (pj1, pj2) ∈ P ′ be a pair of valid proofs such that ϕ(si1, pj1), ϕ(si2, pj2) = 1. Then it follows that ϕ ′(s ′, p ′) = 1. Thus every true statement has a valid proof so Σ ′ is complete. □ P ′ = P × P ϕ ′(s ′, p ′) = 1 ⟺ ϕ(si, pj) = 1 for two distinct i1, i2 ∈ [3] where p ′ = (p1, p2) (a) b) Let the set of proofs P ∗ and the veriﬁcation function ϕ ∗ : S × P ∗ → {0, 1} be deﬁned as given below. Proof that Σ ∗ is correct and complete. Let's start with the former. Assume for some s ∈ S there exists a valid proof p∗ ∈ P ∗ such that ϕ∗(s, p∗) = 1. By assumption it must hold that both conditions in the RHS of deﬁnition (b) are satisﬁed. Thus we have ϕ(˙s, p) = 1 ⟺ τ(˙s) = 1, since Σ is sound. Furthermore, ϕ((s, ˙s), –p) ⟺ –τ(s, ˙s) = 1 since Σ is also sound. By deﬁnition (1) of the proof system Σ, it must be that τ(s) = 0, since exactly one of the statements can be true in Σ and it's established that τ(˙s) = 1. Thus it follows that for any statement s ∈ S for which there exists p ∗ ∈ P ∗ with ϕ ∗(s, p ∗) = 1 it holds that τ ∗(s) = 1 ⟺ τ(s) = 0. Hence Σ ∗ is sound. Now let's cover the latter. Assume τ ∗(s) = 1 for an arbitrary s ∈ S. Since Σ is complete, for some statement ˙s ∈ S with τ(˙s) = 1 there exists a valid proof for it p ∈ P such that ϕ(˙s, p) = 1. Additionally, since the proof system Σ is also complete, for some true statement in it, i.e. (s, ˙s) ∈ S 2 with, –τ(s, ˙s) = 1 there exists a valid proof –p ∈ P for it such that ϕ((s, ˙s), –p) = 1. Thus, for an arbitrary true statement s ∈ S, there exists a valid proof p ∗ = ((˙s, s), –p) ∈ P ∗ which satisﬁes ϕ ∗(s, p ∗) = 1 by construction as above. □ P ∗ = (S × P) × P ϕ ∗(s, p ∗) = 1 ⟺ ϕ(˙s, p) = 1 and ϕ((s, ˙s), –p) = 1 for p ∗ = ((˙s, p), –p) (b)––– – ––––","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
