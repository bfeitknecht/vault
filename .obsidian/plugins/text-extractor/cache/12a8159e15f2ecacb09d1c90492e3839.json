Use a zip file or tarball that contains the report and all other files you used for the report, i.e., the entire Verilog project folder and/or all schematics you drew. If any files are missing, it may negatively impact your grade. No shortcuts/links will be accepted. Only one member from each group should submit the report. All members of the group will get the same grade. The submitted file’s name should be Lab8-2_LastName1_LastName2.zip (or .tar), where LastName1, LastName2 are the last names of the members of the group. The deadline for the report is a hard deadline and it will not be extended. Exercise 1 (2 Points) Below is a part of the MIPS block diagram. Draw the necessary modifications for the memory-mapped I/O on this block diagram. (We are only interested in the SW and LW instructions; the rest of the block diagram has been purposefully left out. Hint: If your circuit works, you already implemented this in the MIPS.v module. Digital Design and Computer Architecture: Lab Report Lab 8: Full System Integration (Session II) Date Grade Names Lab session / lab room 2 Exercise 2 (1 Point) Using Figure 1 as a reference, what additional hardware/architectural changes are needed in the top module (top.v file) to implement Challenge 2 described in the Manual of Lab 8, Session 2? You can either draw the additional circuitry required or write in your own words here.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
