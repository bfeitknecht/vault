We can transform the multi-source multi-sink problem into a maximum flow problem by adding a consolidated source connecting to each vertex in S and a consolidated sink connected by each vertex in T' (also known as supersource and supersink) with infinite capacity on each edge (See Fig. 4.1.1.).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"deu+eng"}
