Let M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F ), where Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4} is the set of all states, Σ = {a, b} is the input alphabet, and F = {q4} is the set of accepted states. The graph representation of M follows. a b a b a b a b a, b q0 q1 q2 q3 q4 The equivalence classes of the states for some preﬁx words w ∈ Σ∗, where w does not contain the substring abba and doesn't end in abb. □ Kl[q0] = Σ∗ − ⋃ p∈Q−{q0} Kl[p] Kl[q1] = {wa} Kl[q2] = {wab} Kl[q3] = {wabb} Kl[q4] = {yabbaz ∣ y, z ∈ Σ∗} (b) Informally, this language L2 describes all words that contain a diﬀerent parity amount of a and b. This implies that all words in L2 have odd length, since the sum of an even and odd number is, again odd. Formally, we deﬁne a ﬁnite automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F ), where Q = {q0, q1}, Σ = {a, b} and F = {q1}. The transition function is deﬁned for (p, x) ∈ Q × Σ. δ(p, x) = { The graphic representation of M2 is below. a b a b q0 q1 The equivalence classes of M2 are all words with equal parity occurrences of a and b, and diﬀerent parity occurrences of a and b, respectively. In particular one notes, that all words of even length are in Kl[q0] and all words of odd length are in Kl[q1]. □ q1, if p = q0 q0, else Kl[q0] = {w ∈ Σ∗ ∣ |w|a ≡2 |w|b} Kl[q1] = {w ∈ Σ∗ ∣ |w|a ≢2 |w|b} 9 Let M = {Q, Σ, δM , q0, F } be a ﬁnite state machine, where Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4} denotes the set of states, Σ = {a, b} is the input alphabet, q0 is the initial state, δM is the transition function between states and F = {q0, q3} is the set of accepted states. The language accepted by M can be deﬁned as L(M) = {(aa)n(bb)m ∣ n, m ∈ N}, i.e. all the words that consist of an even number of only a or b, all the words that consist of an even number of a followed by an even number of b or the empty word λ. Furthermore, we deﬁne the equivalence classes of all the states. Kl[q0] = {(aa)n ∣ n ∈ N} Kl[q1] = {an ∣ n ∈ N, n ≡2 1} Kl[q2] = {(aa)nbm ∣ n, m ∈ N, m ≡2 1} Kl[q3] = {(aa)n(bb)m ∣ n, m ∈ N, m ≥ 1} Kl[q4] = Σ∗ − ⋃ p∈Q−{q4} Kl[p] Kl[q0] contains the words that consist of an even number of a, and the empty word λ Kl[q1] is deﬁned as the words that consist of an odd number of only a Kl[q2] is the words that consist of an even number of a followed by an odd number of b and words that consist of an odd number of only b Kl[q3] is words that consist of an even number of a followed by an even number of b and words that consist of an even number of only b Kl[q4] is all rest, i.e. all the words that are not in any of the other classes (*) □","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
