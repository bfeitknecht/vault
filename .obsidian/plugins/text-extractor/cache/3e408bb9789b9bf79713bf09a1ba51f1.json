In that cas e , we enter the first for-loop , which will iterate only for t = 0 (one time) . At the second for-loop we assign N to be the root mode . The third for-loop will be again executed only on ce , since (height (T) - 1) = (1-1)= 0 · Then inside the foreloop, we assign G do the only node in level 1 and key((2) = - X , because C2 doesn't exist. Assuming , that the binary free we took at the beginning has aro o t , which is smaller than the leaf. It would enter the first if condition and would swap both modes . Then it would exit and we would have a correct max-heap, where the root is bigger than its leaf. therefore , the algorithm is correct for n = 2.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
