{"path":"var/attachments/network-flow-vertex-capacity.png","text":"Let N = (V, E) be a network. Suppose there is capacity at each node in addition to edge capacity, that is, a mapping c : V — R+‚ such that the flow f has to satisfy not only the capacity constraint and the conservation of flows, but also the vertex capacity constraint Z fır < c(v) Yo e V\\{s,t}. ieV In other words, the amount of flow passing through a vertex cannot exceed its capacity. To find the maximum flow across NV, we can transform the problem into the maximum flow problem in the original sense by expanding N. First, each v € V is replaced by vin and vout, Where vy, is connected by edges going into v and vy IS connected to edges coming out from v, then assign capacity c(v) to the edge connecting vin and voyt (see Fig. 4.4.1). In this expanded network, the vertex capacity constraint is removed and therefore the problem can be treated as the original maximum flow problem.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":"deu+eng"}
