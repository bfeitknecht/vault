## Automation

execute save workspace layout:
```
open --background "obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=vault&commandid=workspaces%253Asave"
```


```
# tab title bar
obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=vault&commandid=snippet-commands-obsidian%253Asnippet-command-toggle-view-header

# edit bar
obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=vault&commandid=editing-toolbar%253Ahide-show-menu

# status and ribbon
obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=vault&commandid=cmdr%253Amacro-0




```


open neovim doesn't work but creates the process, maybe the problem is that the iterm server starts its shell after the nvim exec? but then the process would die...
