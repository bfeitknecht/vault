## Automation

execute save workspace layout:
```
open --background "obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=vault&commandid=workspaces%253Asave"
```



open neovim doesn't work but creates the process, maybe the problem is that the iterm server starts its shell after the nvim exec? but then the process would die...




```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Hi");
}
```
