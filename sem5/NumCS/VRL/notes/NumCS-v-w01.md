# Info
Professor will not budge on uploading lecture recordings before end of semester.


# Topics
- catastrophic cancellation
- complex step differentiation
- matrix operations algorithms


# Notes
- rounding errors due to the implementation of floats
- stable computation for roots of quadratic polynomial
- power series approximation is rarely used in practice due to catastrophic cancellation
	- requires function to be differentiable around point of interest
