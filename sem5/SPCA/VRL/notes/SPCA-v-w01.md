# Info
"In practice, the difference in productivity between the worst and best programmer is on the order of two magnitudes."

# Topics
- introduction to the C programing language
- so many things are implementation defined


# Notes
- LLM does not rise to the task of writing system program
- floating point arithmetic's addition is not associative
	- floats are not numbers!
	- this is not a bug but correct specification
- performance in the real world is about much more than asymptotic complexity
	- constant factors may dominate
- computers don't just execute programs
- programs don't just calculate values
- programs are not semantic specifications
