# Info
"In general, linear things are easier."

# Topics
- ordinary differential equation
- partial differential equation
- order of differential equation
- linear differential equations
- differential operator
- initial value problem


# Notes
- ODE relates univariate function with differentials
- PDE relates multivariate function with differentials
- order of differential equation is largest derivative present in equation
- linear differential equation
	- $y^{(k)} + a_{k-1} y ^{(k-1)} \cdots + a_{0} y = b$, where $y, a_{i}, b$ are functions in $x$
	- $a_{i}$ are coefficient functions
	- if $b(x) = 0$ then the equation describes homogenous system
	- no products between derivatives
	- no compositions with derivatives
		- no powers of derivatives other than one
- differentiation operator is linear
	- $D(f) = f^{(k)} + a_{k-1}f^{(k-1)} \cdots + a_{0}f$
	- $D(\alpha f + \beta g) = \alpha D(f) + \beta D(g)$
- initial condition is set of equations specifying values of $f, f', \dots f^{(k-1)}$ at some point $x_{0}$
- initial value problem is differential equation together with initial condition
