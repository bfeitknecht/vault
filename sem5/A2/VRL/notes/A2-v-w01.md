# Info
"In general, linear things are easier."

# Topics
- ordinary differential equation
- partial differential equation
- order of differential equation
- linear differential equations

# Notes
- ODE relates univariate function with differentials
- PDE relates multivariate function with differentials
- order of differential equation is largest derivative present in equation
- linear differential equation
	- $y^{(k)} + a_{k - 1} y ^{k - 1} \cdots + a_{0} y = b$, where $y, a_{i}, b$ are functions in $x$
	- $a_{i}$ are coefficient functions
	- if $b(x) = 0$ then the equation describes homogenous system
	- no products between derivatives
	- no compositions with derivatives
		- no powers of derivatives other than one
