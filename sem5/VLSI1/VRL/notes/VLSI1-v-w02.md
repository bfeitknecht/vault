# Info
"You can never have enough memory."

# Topics
- FPGA


# Notes
- programming (an FPGA) is nothing else than storing the appropriate logic values in the memory
- area of FPGA is dominated by wires to connect switches
- due to FPGA being produced in much higher volume, more advanced fabrication techniques can be used
- modern FPGA has blocks for dedicated functions (memory, arithmetic, signal processing, ...)
