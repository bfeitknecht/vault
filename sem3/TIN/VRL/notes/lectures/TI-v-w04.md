Proof by contradiction for non-regularity of some language $L$ per definition of *finite* state machine and pigeonhole principle. For the sake of contradiction, let's assume there exists a finite

where $|Q|$ states but $|Q|+1$ input words implies that there exists two input words that result in the same state. Then, per lemma 3.3.
