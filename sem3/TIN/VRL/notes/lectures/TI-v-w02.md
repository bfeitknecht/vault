# Notes

Every message can at most be compressed to the length of its compression plus the compression algorithm.

The kolmogorov complexity of some word measures the length of the shortest program that generates that word. Between programming languages, it differs at most with some constant.

Programs (which are [[word|words]] over some [[alphabet]]) can be "translated" between programming languages, since both are just computing models, i.e. they are equivalent in the class of problems they can solve. Additionally, the kolmogorov complexity is also only affected by some constant entirely dependent on the programming languages, not the words they use.
