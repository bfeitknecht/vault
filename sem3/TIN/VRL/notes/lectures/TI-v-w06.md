- [[mutli tape turing machine]]
- [[recursive language]]
- equivalence of turing machine
- FSM and TM as turing complete computational model

# Notes

two machines $A, B$ equivalent $\implies$ accepted languages $L(A) = L(B)$ identical
BUT other direction doesn‘t hold, since we don‘t distinguish between rejecting and not halting for the accepted languages!!!

power set construction of FSM based on NFSM #todo
