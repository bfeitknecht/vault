For the sake of contradiction, let's assume $L_{1}$ to be regular.

We consider the language
$$
\begin{align}
L_{w^2} = \{y \mid wwy\in L_{1}\} 
\end{align}
$$
Since
$$
\begin{align}
(n+1) \cdot 2 = 2n+2
\end{align}
$$
is for any $n\in\mathbb N$ the string $y_1 = 0^{2n+2}$ is the canonical first word of the language $L_{w^2}$.

By theorem 3.1 there exists a constant $c$, independent of $m$, so that
$$
\begin{align}
K(y_{1}) \leq \lceil \log_{2}(1+1) + c=1+c \rceil .
\end{align}
$$
The number of all programs whose length is less than or equal to $1+c$ is finite.
But there are an infinite amount of words of the type $0^{2n+2}$, so this is a contradiction.

Therefore, $L_1$ is not regular.

Assume $L_2 = \{0^2,0^3,0^5,\dots\}$ is regular.
Let $w_{0},w_{1},w_{2},\dots$ be the words of $L_2$ in canonical sequence. According to the Pumping Lemma there exists a $n_{0}\in\mathbb N$, so that the conditions (i)-(iii) are fulfilled.

We choose $w=w_k=0^p$, where $p$ is the $k$-th prime number and $p>n_{0}$.

It is easy to see that $|w| \geq n_{0}$ and consequently there exists a decomposition $w=yxz$ ($y=0^l$, $x=0^m$ und $z=0^{p-l-m}$), which satisfies conditions (i)-(iii).

Since by (i) $|xy|=l+m\leq n_{0}$, we have $|x|=m\leq n_{0}$.

From (ii), it follows that $|x|=m\geq1$.

Because of $|yx^2z| =|yxz| +|x|$, it follows that $|yxz|<|yx^2z|\leq|yxz|+n_{0}$.

The next word in $L_2$ after $w_p=0^p$ is $w_{p'} =0^{p'}$, where $p'$ is the next prime number after $p$ and it holds
$$
\begin{align}
|w_{p'}| - |w_{p}| &=p'-p \\
&>1
\end{align}
$$
The strict inequality holds because when $p>2$ the next primenumber $p' \geq p+2$.
Thus follows
$$
\begin{align}
|w_{p}|<|yx^2z|<|w_{p'}|
\end{align}
$$
It follows $yx^2z\not\in L_{2}$, while $yxz\in L_{2}$, contradicting (iii).

$q_{0}$ represents $x$, the edge from $q_{0}$ to $q_{1}$ is for the first $0$ in $w$. Because $y$ is two long there are $q_2$ and $q_3$ for that and then the edge to $q_4$ is the second $0$. And finally the loop with 0 and 1 is for the word $z$.

We first draw the (deterministic) finite automaton.

Let's assume for contradiction that there exists a finite automaton that accepts $L_{2}$ and has fewer than 6 states.
We choose the words $B = \{\lambda,a,ab,abb,abbb,b\}$.
According to the pigeonhole principle, there exist two words $w_{i},w_{j}\in B, w_{i}\neq w_{j}$, so that
$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\delta}(q_0, w_i) = \hat{\delta}(q_0, w_j)
\end{align}
$$
According to Lemma 3.3, it follows that
$$
\begin{align}
\forall z \in \Sigma^* : w_i z \in L \iff w_j z \in L
\end{align}
$$
We look at the following table with suffixes.

|           | $a$ | $ab$      | $abb$     | $abbb$    | $b$       |
| --------- | --- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| $\lambda$ | $b$ | $\lambda$ | $bb$      | $b$       | $abb$     |
| $a$       |     | $\lambda$ | $bb$      | $ab$      | $b$       |
| $ab$      |     |           | $\lambda$ | $\lambda$ | $\lambda$ |
| $abb$     |     |           |           | $b$       | $bb$      |
| $abbb$    |     |           |           |           | $b$       |
This shows for each word pair $x,y \in B, x\neq y$ the existence of a suffix $z$, so that
$$
\begin{align}
(xz \in L \land yz \notin L) \lor (xz \notin L \land yz \in L)
\end{align}
$$
This can be easily verified with the given suffixes and the specified EA.

This contradicts the previous statement that there exists a word pair $w_i, w_j \in B,w_{i}\neq w_{j}$, such that 
$$
\begin{align}
\forall z \in \Sigma^* : w_i z \in L \iff w_j z \in L
\end{align}
$$
Thus, our assumption is false, and $L$ is not regular.
