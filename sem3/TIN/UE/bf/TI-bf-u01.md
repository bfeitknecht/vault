Let $f:\N \to \N$ denote the number of words of length $n\in \N$ over $\Sigma$ that contain each of the three letters at least once.

We need to find words $w\in \Sigma^n$ of length $n$, i.e. $|w|=n$ such that $\forall x \in \Sigma : |w|_x \geq 1$. It is known that for some $n$, there exist $|\Sigma|^n$ words of length $n$. In other words, let $L \def \{ w \in \Sigma^n : |w|=n\}$ 


Next, we just subtract all words that do not contain each letter at least once.

$3^{n-2}\cdot2$
$$
f(n) \def \begin{cases}
0, & n < 3 \\
n!, & n \geq 3
\end{cases}
