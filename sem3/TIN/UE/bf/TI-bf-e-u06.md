Let $M_{1}, M_{2}$ be two non-deterministic finite automata such that $L_{1}=L(M_{1})$ and $L_{2}=L(M_{2})$. Then we construct a non-deterministic finite automaton $M$ as a product of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ such that $L=L(M)$.

Formally we define this as $M=(Q,\Gamma,\delta,q_{0M},F)$, where $Q=Q_{1} \cup Q_{2}$ denotes the finite set of states, $\Gamma= \{ a,b,c \}$ denotes the input alphabet, $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is the state transition function, $q_{0}=q_{0M_{1}}$ is the initial state and $F = F_{2}$ is the set of accepted states.

dito

because the union of a countably infinite list of countably infinite sets is countable per dmath


This works because the kleenian star operator preserves set numerosity, i.e. $A^{*} \sim A$
