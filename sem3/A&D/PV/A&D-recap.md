# ADT (abstract data types)

## Heap

`extract()`
	replace root with last leaf
	restore heap condition

`insert(n)`
	add `n` as last leaf
	restore heap condition by iteratively swapping up if greater than parent

## BST (binary search tree)

`remove(n)`
	- replace `n`with symmetric successor
	- left subtree's rightmost child or right subtree's leftmost child

## AVL (balanced BST)

The AVL condition states that left and right subtrees' height differ by at most one, $|h_{l} - h_{r}| \leq 1$.




# Algorithms

## Graphs

- **explore** graphs (directed and undirected)
	![[dfs (algorithm)]]
	![[bfs (algorithm)]]

- construct **MST**
	kruskal (algorithm)
	prim (algorithm)
	boruvka (algorithm)

- find **shortest paths**
	![[dijkstra (algorithm)]]
	bellman-ford (algorithm)
	floyd-warshall (algorithm)
	johnson (algorithm)

## Sorting

- easy implementations but bad runtime
	![[bubble sort (algorithm)]]
	![[selection sort (algorithm)]]
	![[insertion sort (algorithm)]]

- harder to implement but optimal runtime
	quick sort (algorithm)
	merge sort (algorithm)
	heap sort (algorithm)
