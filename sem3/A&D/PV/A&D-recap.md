# ADT (abstract data types)

## Heap

`extract()`
	replace root with last leaf
	restore heap condition

`insert(n)`
	add `n` as last leaf
	restore heap condition by iteratively swapping up if greater than parent

## BST (binary search tree)

`remove(n)`
	- replace `n`with symmetric successor
	- left subtree's rightmost child or right subtree's leftmost child

## AVL (balanced BST)

The AVL condition states that left and right subtrees' height differ by at most one, $|h_{l} - h_{r}| \leq 1$.
