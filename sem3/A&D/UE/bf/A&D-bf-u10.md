We assume the connected graph $H = (V, F)$ on the same $n = |V|$ vertices as the complete graph $G = K_{n}$ has a closed eulerian walk $T = (f_{i})_{k}$.


weight of hamilton cycle in $G$ at most that of closed eulerian walk in $H$


for every edge in $f \in F$, check if the weight in $H$ of that edge is more than that in $G$. if so, remove it and take the edge between those vertices in $G$
