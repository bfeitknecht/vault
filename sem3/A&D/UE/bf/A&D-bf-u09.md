## (a) ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=1&rect=85,306,533,321|A&D-e-u09, p.1]]

True. Proof by contradiction. Assume $G$ has no sources, $\forall v \in V : \deg_{in}(v) \geq 1$. Then we find a topological sorting. Contradiction. This topological sorting has to start from a source but by assumption there are none. Furthermore, a topological sorting is possible if and only if the graph is a directed acyclic cycle. Contraposition of the fact that it doesn't implies that $G$ contains a cycle.

## (b) ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=1&rect=85,271,534,301|A&D-e-u09, p.1]]

False. Consider the following counter example. Observe that every vertex has even in-degree and out-degree, $\forall v \in V : \deg_{in}(v) \equiv_{2} \deg_{out}(v) \equiv_{2} 0$. However, $G$ does not contain a directed eulerian walk.

True. $A, B, C, F, D, H, I, E, G$ is a topological sorting.

# 9.4      Longest Path in DAG ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=3&rect=67,337,530,380|A&D-e-u09, p.3]]

## (a) ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=3&rect=85,319,533,332|A&D-e-u09, p.3]]

Assume for some path $P = (v_{i_{j}})_{j \in [k]}$ of length $k$ there exists two indices $j_{1}, j_{2} \in [k]$ such that $i_{j_{1}} > i_{j_{2}}$. It's given that the lexicographic order of vertices forms a sequence $T = (v_{i})_{n}$ of topological sorting. Then it follows that for $s=i_{j_{1}}, t=i_{j_{2}}$ the edge $(v_{s}, v_{t}) = e \in E$ forms a directed cycle $C = e \cup (v_{t})_{s}$. Contradiction. By assumption the given graph $G$ is acyclic. Through contraposition the implication is proven.

1. dimension of integers memoization table is $n$, formally `dp = int[n]`
2. subproblems consist of the length of longest path up to vertex $i$, formally `dp[v] = max length path to v`
3. recursion, base cases and calculation order is given below, the correctness follows from the fact that traversing a path always increases its length and we always store the maximum of reaching a vertex from the current path and the one traversed before that
```python
# initialize dp table
l = [0] * n

# iterate over vertices in topological order
for v in range(n):      # v1, v2, ..., vn
    for w in Adj[v]:    # vertices adjacent to v
        l[w] = max(l[w], l[v] + 1)     # extend path from v or leave unchanged
# return maximum length path in dp table
return max(dp)
```
4. computation order is given above, iterate over the $n$ vertices
5. extracting the solution is done by finding the maximum of the memo array, `max{dp}`
6. runtime is $O(|V| + |E|)$, recursion iterates over every edge $e \in E$ and extraction iterates over every vertex $v \in V$ exactly once

# 9.5      DFS doesn't solve Eulerian Cycle ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=4&rect=67,638,530,668|A&D-e-u09, p.4]]

## (a) ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=4&rect=85,129,528,406|A&D-e-u09, p.4]]

The pre-order generated by DFS is $P = (a, b, d, c, e)$. The DFS tree is given below.
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary {graphs}

\begin{document}

\tikz[nodes={draw,circle}] {
  \node (a) at (0,3) {a};
  \node (b) at (-1,2) {b};
  \node (c) at (1,2) {c};
  \node (d) at (-1, 1) {d};
  \node (e) at (1, 1) {e};

  \graph[]{
    (a) -- (b) -- (d),
    (a) -- (c) -- (e)
  };
}

\end{document}
```

The generated walk is $W=(a, e, c, a, d, b, a)$. This is an eulerian cycle, since it contains every edge $e \in E$ exactly once and the ending vertex is identical to the starting vertex.
$\square$

## (b) ![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=4&rect=85,94,528,123|A&D-e-u09, p.4]]
![[A&D-e-u09.pdf#page=5&rect=84,525,531,771|A&D-e-u09, p.5]]

For starting vertex $a \in V$ we have the pre-order $P=(a,c,b,d,f,g,h,i,e)$ and the following DFS tree.
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary {graphs}

\begin{document}

\tikz[nodes={draw,circle}] {
  \node (a) at (0,7) {a};
  \node (b) at (0,5) {b};
  \node (c) at (0,6) {c};
  \node (d) at (0,4) {d};
  \node (e) at (1,1) {e};
  \node (f) at (0,3) {f};
  \node (g) at (0,2) {g};
  \node (h) at (0,1) {h};
  \node (i) at (0,0) {i};

  \graph[]{
    (a) -- (c) -- (b) -- (d) -- (f) -- (g) -- (h) -- (i),
    (g) -- (e)
  };
}

\end{document}
```

The generated walk is $W =(a,d,f,g,e,c,b,d,c,a)$ which is missing the edges $\{ g,h \}, \{ h,i \}, \{ g,i \} \in E$. Thus it isn't eulerian and the algorithm produces a false output.
$\square$
