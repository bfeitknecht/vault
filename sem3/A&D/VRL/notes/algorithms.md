# What are algorithms?

Algorithms solve (hard) problems by systematically solving easier subproblems consisting of [[elementary-operation]]s.



## Pasture Break

#### Problem
Cow wants to escape through a hole in an infinite fence, what is the best strategy to take the least amount of steps to reach the hole?

#### Idea
- ~~could just choose a direction and keep walking~~ --> only works half the time
- walk a step one way, two stes the other, keep switching directions while walking one more step --> in the worst case $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ steps are taken
- dito, but double the steps every time we switch directions -->
