A vector is just a list of numbers in $\mathbb R^m$, and can be interpreted as an $m$-dimensional point or an arrow from the origin to that point (motion).


# Vector Operations

## Vector Addition

## Scalar Multiplication

Let $\lambda \in \mathbb R$. For some $v = [a_{1}, \dots, a_{m}] \in \mathbb R^m$. Then $\lambda \cdot v =$
