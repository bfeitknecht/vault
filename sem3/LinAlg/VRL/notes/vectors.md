# What is a Vector?

A vector is just a list of numbers in $\mathbb R^m$, and can be interpreted as an $m$-dimensional point or an arrow from the origin to that point (motion).


# Vector Operations

## Vector Addition

## Scalar Multiplication

Let $\lambda \in \mathbb R$. For some $v = [a_{1}, \dots, a_{m}] \in \mathbb R^m$, then $\lambda v = [\lambda a_{1}, \dots, \lambda a_{m}]$. Basically, stre

## Linear Combinations

Combines scalar multiplication and vector addition
