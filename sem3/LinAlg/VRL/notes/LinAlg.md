Linear Algebra concerns itself with [[vector|vectors]], [[matrix|matrices]] and what you can do with them. This enables us to model motion in space, efficiently compute with big data and much more. It is a powerful tool for [[abstraction]] in many different areas of math, computer science and engineering.
