From the previous exercise we know the following.
> $1a)$ hyperplane $H$ is a subspace of $V$
> $1b)$ dimension of hyperplane $H$ is $\dim(V)-1$

To arrive at the dimension of $S^{\mathbf{v}}$, we will show that it is a hyperplane of the vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^{2 \times m}$, per lemma 4.5.

Then, we need to prove that $S^{\mathbf{v}}$ is a hyperplane, for an arbitrary non-zero vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$.

Thus, $\dim(S^{\mathbf{v}}) = 2m-1$.
