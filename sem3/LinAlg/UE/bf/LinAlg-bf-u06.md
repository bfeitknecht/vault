From the previous exercise we know the following.
> $1a)$ hyperplane $H$ is a subspace of $V$
> $1b)$ dimension of hyperplane $H$ is $\dim(V)-1$

To arrive at the dimension of $S^{\mathbf{v}}$, we will show that it is a hyperplane of the vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^{2 \times m}$.

First, let's show that $V$ is indeed a vector space.


Thus, $2m-1$.
