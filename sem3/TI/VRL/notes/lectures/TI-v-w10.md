- savitch's theorem (non-deterministic space complexity is at most square deterministic space complexity)
- reachable procedure


$\mathrm{DLOG} \subseteq \mathrm{NLOG} \subseteq \mathrm{P} \subseteq \mathrm{NP} \subseteq \mathrm{PSPACE} \subseteq \mathrm{EXPTIME}$

the following strict subset inclusions are known to hold

$\mathrm{DLOG} \subsetneq \mathrm{PSPACE}$ and $\mathrm{P} \subsetneq \mathrm{EXPTIME}$

- $\mathrm{P}$ can be understood as finding a proof
- $\mathrm{NP}$ can be understood as verifying a proof
