- [[turing machine (TM)]]
- [[mutli tape turing machine]]
- [[recursive language]]
- [[power set construction]] to get FSM from NFSM
- equivalence of turing machines
- FSM and TM as turing complete computational model
- MTM, TM, NTM, etc. all equivalent in computational "power"

# Notes

two turing machines $A, B$ equivalent $\implies$ accepted languages $L(A) = L(B)$ identical
BUT other direction doesn‘t hold, since we don‘t distinguish between rejecting and not halting for the accepted languages!!!

power set construction of FSM based on NFSM #todo
