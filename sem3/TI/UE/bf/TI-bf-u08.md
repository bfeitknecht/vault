# 22

Prove that the language below is not recursive by providing an explicit mapping reduction and proving its correctness.
$$
L_{\mathrm{reach}} = \{ \mathrm{Kod}(M)\#0^{i} \mid i \in \mathbb{N}, |Q_{M}| \geq i+1, \exists w \in \Sigma_{M}^{*} \}
$$

# 23 

We consider an alphabet $\Sigma$ and the following language. Show that it is not recursive by applying rice's theorem.
$$
L_{\mathrm{all}}  = \{ \mathrm{Kod}(M) \mid L(M) = \Sigma^{*} \}
$$



# 24

Let $M$ be a 1-tape TM that always halts. Prove that there exists an equivalent 2-tape TM $A$ such that the following holds for some constant $c$ and for all $n$.
$$
\begin{align}
\mathrm{Time}_{A}(n) &\leq \frac{\mathrm{Time}_{A}(n)}{2} + \frac{13n}{12} + c
\end{align}
$$
