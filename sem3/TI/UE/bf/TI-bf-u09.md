## a) ![[TI-e-u09.pdf#page=1&rect=95,376,531,393|TI-e-u09, p.1]]

To prove is that for any two languages $L_{1}, L_{2} \in \mathrm{NTIME}(f)$ it holds that $L_{1} \cup L_{2} \in \mathrm{NTIME}(f)$. Notice that the given function $f$ is time-constructible, since it grows monotonically and is always greater or equal to its input.

By definition of $\mathrm{NTIME}$, it holds that there exist two non-deterministic MTM $M_{1}, M_{2}$ that accept the given languages, i.e. $L_{1} = L(M_{1})$ and $L_{2} = L(M_{2})$. Then it's given that $\mathrm{Time}_{M_{1}}(n), \mathrm{Time}_{M_{2}}(n) \in O(f(n))$. This is defined as the duration of the longest computation on all inputs of length $n$.

Then construct a non-deterministic MTM $M$ that first simulates $M_{1}$ and then $M_{2}$ on some input $x$ of length $n$. If there exists an accepting computation in either $M_{1}$ or $M_{2}$ then $M$ accepts $x$. If this isn't the case, $M$ rejects. Thus $M$ accepts exactly the union of the two languages, i.e. $L(M) = M_{1} \cup M_{2}$.  By construction we have $\mathrm{Time}_{M}(n) = \max\{ \mathrm{Time}_{M_{1}}(n), \mathrm{Time}_{M_{2}}(n) \}$. Thus it follows that $\mathrm{Time}_{M}(n) \in O(f(n))$ and hence $L_{1} \cup L2 \in \mathrm{NTIME}(f)$.

Informally it can be argued that a non-deterministic MTM that accepts the union of the two languages takes at most as long as the longer one of the two non-deterministic MTM that accept either one. Since this is still within the bounds of the space complexity class defined by $f$, the union of the languages is in the same time complexity class.
$\square$


## b) ![[TI-e-u09.pdf#page=1&rect=96,350,532,368|TI-e-u09, p.1]]

Let $M_{1}$ be a non-deterministic MTM that accepts $L = L(M_{1})$ with $\mathrm{Time}_{M}(n) \in O(f(n))$ and let $M_{2}$ be a deterministic MTM that accepts $L' = L(M_{2})$ with $\mathrm{Time}_{M_{2}}(n) \in O(f(n))$, by the definitions of the complexity classes $\mathrm{NTIME}(f)$ and $\mathrm{TIME}(f)$. Then we prove that $L - L' \in \mathrm{NTIME}(f)$ by describing the construction of a non-deterministic MTM $M$ that accepts $L - L' = L(M)$ with $\mathrm{Time}_{M}(n) \in O(f(n))$.

For an input $x$ of length $n$, first $M$ simulates $M_{1}$ to determine if $x \in L$. If it isn't, $M$ rejects $x$. Then in a second step, $M$ simulates $M_{2}$ on $x$ and accepts if $x \not\in L'$, else it rejects. Hence $L(M) = \{ x \in L : x \not\in L' \} = L - L'$, with $\mathrm{Time}_{M}(n) = \mathrm{Time}_{M_{1}}(n) + \mathrm{Time}_{M_{2}}(n)$ which is trivially in $O(f(n))$. Thus $L - L' \in \mathrm{NTIME}(f)$
 
Informally this can be understood as stating that the problem of deciding the language $L - L'$ isn't any "easier" by subtracting all words of a language in deterministic time complexity, since $\mathrm{TIME}(t) \subseteq \mathrm{NTIME}(t)$ for any function $t$ by lemma 6.6.
$\square$
