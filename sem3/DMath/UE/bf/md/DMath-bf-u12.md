Prove the following statements of predicate logic (Definition 6.36.). Do not use other results from the lecture notes.

Let $F = \exists x \forall y P(x,y)$ be the LHS of the logical consequence to prove and $G = \exists x P(x, f(x))$ be the RHS. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a suitable interpretation for both $F$ and $G$. It remains to show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is model for $F$ then it's also model for $G$. Assume $\mathcal{A} \models F$.

Let $F = \lnot(\forall x P(x))$ and $G = \exists x \lnot P(x)$. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a suitable structure for both $F, G$. Then we show that if $\mathcal{A} \models F$
