The algebra $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ is a commutative ring, by example 5.34. Then, by theorem 5.21, if $R$ is a commutative ring, the extension $R[x]$ is also a commutative ring. Thus the structure $\mathbb{Z}_{3}[x]$ is a non-trivial commutative ring, since the additive and multiplicative identity are distinct, $\mathbf{0}\neq \mathbf{1}$.

Per lemma 5.35, for a ring $F[x]$, then $F[x]_{m(x)}$ is a ring with respect to addition and multiplication. Thus the algebra $\mathbb{Z}_{3}[x]_{x^{3}+2x^{2}+1}$ is a ring.

Finally, for a ring $F$ its extension field $F[x]_{m(x)}$ is a field if and only if $m(x)$ is irreducible, by theorem 5.37. Thus all that remains to show is that $m(x) = x^{3}+2x^{2}+1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_{3}[x]$.



To do this, it follows from definition 5.28 and the fact that degrees of polynomials are added under multiplication. Hence, since the degree of the modulus polynomial is three $\deg(m(x))=3$, we prove that it has no monic polynomial divisors, i.e. $(x+\alpha) \not\mid x^{3}+2x^{2}+1$ holds for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{3}$.

$R_{m(x)}(x) = x^{2}+2x+2$
