We want to show that $\langle G; \ast \rangle \simeq \langle H; \ast \rangle \times \langle K; \ast \rangle$. Per definition of the commutative group $G$, its carrier set is the elements of the subgroups $H, K$ under the group operation $*$ and that the carrier sets of the two subgroups are disjunct, except for the neutral element $e$.

We need to prove, that $\langle \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{15}, \odot_{15} \rangle$
