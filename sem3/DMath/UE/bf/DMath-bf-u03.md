Let $S$ be the left hand side of the statement, $n \mid m \ \text{and} \ n \mid (m+1)$ and let $T$ be the right hand side, $n=1$. 
Let $U$ be the statement to prove, $S \implies T$. From the script we know that $U$, which we defined as $S \implies T$ is false if and only if $S$ is true and $T$ is false.

Now we will assume $U$ to be false, i.e. $S$ to be true and $T$ to be false and show that it leads to a contradiction.



n divides two adjacent numbers but n is not 1

n divides m and n divides m plus one implies n is equal to one


The statement S =⇒ T is false if S is true and T is false, and in all other three cases, S =⇒ T is true.
