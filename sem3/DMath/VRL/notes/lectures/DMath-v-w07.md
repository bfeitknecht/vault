- [[ring]]
- $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, whole numbers complemented with imaginary unit forms the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$
- [[ideal]]
- remainder of division in the real numbers, $R_{m}(a)$
- [[greatest common divisor (gcd)]]
- [[least common multiple (lcm)]]
- [[chinese remainder theorem (CRT)]]



# Notes

a ring is a set closed under two binary operations with inverse element

congruence per modulo over ring

multi-variate polynomial in $k$ variables decomposes under remainder for division by $m$, i.e. respects modulus
