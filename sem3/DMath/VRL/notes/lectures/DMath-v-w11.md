- syntax vs semantic
- propositional logic vs predicate logic
- interpretation


# Notes 

- negation of valid formula is valid formula
- conjunction, disjunction of valid formulas is valid formula
- every interpretation that is a model for a set of formulas defines a group
- literal is atomic formula or its negation
- formula $F$ is tautology means its negation is unsatisfiable, i.e. $\varnothing \models F \iff \neg F \models \bot$
- resolution calculus proves a clause of formulas is unsatisfiable
- CNF is conjunction of disjunctions of literals
- logical calculus is finite set of derivation rules
- theorems are logical consequence of axioms (set of formulas in fixed logic, i.e. theory)


- tautologies are useful because they are theorems in any theory, i.e., for any set of axiom


**Interpretation**
An interpretation is a 4-[[tuple]] $\mathcal{A} = (U, \phi, \psi, \xi )$ where,
1. a
2. b
3. c
4. d
