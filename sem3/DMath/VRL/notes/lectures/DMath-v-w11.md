- syntax vs semantic
- propositional logic vs predicate logic


# Notes 

- negation of valid formula is valid formula
- conjunction, disjunction of valid formulas is valid formula
- every interpretation that is a model for a set of formulas defines a group
- literal is atomic formula or its negation
- formula $F$ is tautology means its negation is unsatisfiable, i.e. $\varnothing \models F \iff \neg F \models \bot$
- resolution calculus proves a clause of formulas is unsatisfiable
- CNF is conjunction of disjunctions of literals
