group [[algebra]] is a monoid $\langle M; \star \rangle$ such that the operation has an inverse


# Notes

- $\langle \Sigma^{*}; \cdot, \lambda \rangle$, where $\cdot$ denotes the concatenation $\mathrm{concat(\cdot, \cdot)}$ and $\lambda$ denotes the empty word is a (non-commutative) monoid
- $\langle A^{A}; \circ, \mathrm{id} \rangle$, where $A^{A}$ denotes the set of functions $\{ f : A \to A \}$ forms a monoid under [[function composition]]
- $\langle \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{ 0 \}; \cdot, {^{-1}}, 1 \rangle$ is a *multiplicative* group
- $\langle \mathbb{Z}; +, -, 0 \rangle$ is an *additive* group
- $\langle \mathbb{Z}_{m}; \oplus_{m}, \ominus_{m}, 0 \rangle$ is an *additive* group
- $\langle \mathbb{Z}^{*}_{m}, \odot_{m}, {\widehat{\phantom{n}}}  , 1 \rangle$ is a *finite*, *multiplicative* group, where ${\widehat{\phantom{n}}}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse modulo $m$
- the set of invertible $m \times m$ matrices forms a (non-commutative for $m \geq 2$) group under [[matrix multiplication]] with the identity matrix as identity element
- $\langle S_{n}; \circ, {^{-1}}, id \rangle$, the *symmetric group* of $n$ elements is non-commutative for $n \geq 3$


When we consider the monoid $\langle A^{A}; \circ, \mathrm{d} \rangle$, a function $f \in A^{A}$ has a left inverse only if it is injective, and has a right inverse only if it is surjective. Hence $f$ has an inverse $f^{-1}$ if and only it is injective.
