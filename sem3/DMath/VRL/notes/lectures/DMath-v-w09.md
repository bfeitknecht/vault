# Notes

- ring is non-empty set equipped with **two** binary operations, $\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot,1 \rangle$
- element in ring is unit if it has inverse
- element $a\neq0$ is zero divisor if $\exists b\neq0:ab=0$

- polynomial is just an ordered list of numbers really
- polynomial is irreducible if it has no root (zero point in image)
- every polynomial is EITHER irreducible OR can be written as sum of product between divisor and quotient, plus remainder 

- non-trivial factorization in a ring is given by elements that are not units
- product of element with unit does not form additional non-trivial factorizations, i.e. is non-trivial factorization $5\cdot7=35$ but $(-5) \cdot (-7) = 35$ isn't, as it's just a different "basis"

- fields with equal number of elements are isomorphic !!


- define different notations for operation in ring, extension and modulus group respectively
