# Notes

A ring is a non-empty set equipped with **two** binary operations.
$$
\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot,1 \rangle 
$$

polynomial is just an ordered list of numbers really

element in ring is unit if it has inverse
element $a\neq0$ is zero divisor if $\exists b\neq0:ab=0$

- polynomial is irreducible if it has no root (zero point in image)
- every polynomial is EITHER irreducible OR can be written as sum of product between divisor and quotient, plus remainder 

non-trivial factorization in a ring is given by elements that are not units

product of element with unit does not form additional non-trivial factorizations, i.e. is a non-trivial factorization $5\cdot7=35$ but $(-5) \cdot (-7) = 35$ isn't, as it's just a different "basis"

fields with equal number of elements are isomorphic !!
