# Notes

A ring is a non-empty set equipped with **two** binary operations.
$$
\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot,1 \rangle 
$$

polynomial is just an ordered list of numbers really

element in ring is unit if it has inverse
element $a\neq0$ is zero divisor if $\exists b\neq0:ab=0$

- polynomial is irreducible if it has no root (zero point in image)
- every polynomial is EITHER irreducible OR can be written as sum of product between divisor and quotient, plus remainder
