Disambiguation of some symbols.

| Symbol     | Usage       | Between    |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| $\to$      | formulas    | terms      |
| $\implies$ | proofs      | statements |
| $=$        | equality    | anything   |
| $\equiv$   | equivalence | formulas   |

Write proofs in the correct implication direction! Start with something true and derive the statement to prove, not the other way around.

$|A\times B | = |A| \cdot |B|$
$|\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^{|A|}$
$0 \leq |A \cap B| \leq \min(|A|, |B|)$


Prove $A \subseteq B$: Let $x \in A$ be arbitrary. Show $x \in B$.
Prove $A = B$: Double set inclusion.
