The **cofactor matrix** $C$ of a [[matrix]] $A$ consists of every entry [[cofactor]] $C_{ij}$. Itâ€™s written as $C=[C_{i, j}]_{m, n}$. If $A$ is a [[square matrix]] then the [[transpose]] of its cofactor matrix is defined as the [[adjugate matrix]] of $A$. The sign of the cofactors follow a checkerboard pattern.
