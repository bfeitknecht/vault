An **orthonormal basis** $Q \subseteq V$ of a vector space $V$ is the [[set]] of $\dim(V)$ [[vector|vectors]] that exhibit [[linear independence]] and are [[orthonormal]].

An orthonormal [[matrix]] $Q$ is just a [[permutation matrix]], i.e. a reordering of columns and/or rows of the coresponding [[identity matrix]].
