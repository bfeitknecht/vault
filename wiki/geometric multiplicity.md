The **geometric multiplicity** of [[eigenvalues]] associated with a [[matrix]] $A \in \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}$ is the [[dimension (vector space)]] of its [[eigenspace]].
$$
\gamma_{A}(\lambda_{j}) = \dim(\mathrm{N}(A - \lambda_{j} I_{n})) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A - \lambda_{j} I_{n})
$$

It corresponds to the number of [[eigenvectors]] associated with that eigenvalue $\lambda_{j}$.
