Let $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ be some [[real number]]. For some [[vector]] $\mathbf{v} = [v_{i}]_{m} \in \mathbb R^m$, i.e. some [[matrix]] $A=[a_{ij}]_{m, n} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ then their **scalar multiplication** with the *scalar* $\lambda$ is given by $\lambda \mathbf{v} = [\lambda v_{i}]_{m}$ and $\lambda A=[\lambda a_{ij}]_{m, n}$.

In essence, we're *scaling* by some [[real number]]. It's noted that multiplication with the scalar $\lambda=0$ gives the [[zero vector]] and [[zero matrix]], respectively.
