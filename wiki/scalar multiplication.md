Let $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ be some [[real number]]. For some [[vector]] $\mathbf{v} = [v_{i}]_{m} \in \mathbb R^m$, i.e. some [[matrix]] $A=[a_{ij}]m, n \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, their **scalar multiplication** with the *scalar* $\lambda$ is given by $\lambda \mathbf{v} = [\lambda v_{i}]_{m}$ and $\lambda A=[\lambda a_{ij}]_{m, n}$, respectively.

its scalar multiplication with $\lambda$ is given by . Similarly, for some [[matrix]] $A=[a_{ij}]m, n \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. then .

In essence, we're *scaling* by some [[real number]]

Basically, stretching or squishing a [[vector]] or [[matrix]] by some [[real number]].
