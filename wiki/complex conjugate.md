The **complex conjugate** of a [[complex number]] is the number with an equal [[real number|real]] part and an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part equal in [[magnitude]] but opposite in sign. That is, if 
$a$ and $b$ are real numbers then the complex conjugate of $a+bi$ is $a-bi$. The complex conjugate of $z$ is often denoted as $\bar{z}$ or $z^*$.

In polar form, if $r$ and $\theta$ are real numbers then the conjugate of $re^{i\theta}$ is $re^{-i\theta}$. This can be shown using Euler's formula.

The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number, $a^2+b^2$ or $r^2$ in polar form.
