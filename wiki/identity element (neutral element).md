A [[arity|binary]] [[operation]] $*$ on a [[set]] $S$ has an **identity element** (**neutral element**) if there is an element $e \in S$ such that the following holds. Here, the auxiliary operation is the operation of [[arity]] zero that has $e$ as its result.
$$
x * e = e * x, \quad \forall x \in S
$$

Furthermore, we say that $e_{r}$ is a *right-identity element* if the below is true.
$$
x * e_{r}* = x, \quad \forall x \in S
$$

Similarly, we define the *left-identity element* $e_{l}$ as follows.
$$
e_{l} * x = x, \quad \forall x \in S
$$

The identity element is *unique*, i.e. an operation in an algebra can't have multiple identity elements. *Proof.* #todo
