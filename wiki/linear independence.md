A [[set]] of [[vector|vectors]] is **linearly independent** if there exists no [[trivial|nontrivial]] [[linear combination]] of the vectors that equals the [[zero vector]]. 

In other words, if at least one vector is a linear combination of some others, the set of vectors is not linearly independent.
