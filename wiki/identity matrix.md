The **identity matrix** $I$ in $\mathbb R^{m\times m}$ is the [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]], [[square matrix]] defined by having entries equal to zero every except for the diagonal, where they are equal to one.  $(I_{m})_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$. In words, it's the matrix that has $1$ as entry on its diagonal and $0$ everywhere else.
