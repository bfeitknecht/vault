The **identity matrix**, often denoted by $I_{m}$ is the [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]], [[square matrix]] defined by having entries equal to zero everywhere except for the diagonal, where they are one. In some contexts, such as [[group theory]] or [[category theory]] where it's also denoted by $\mathbf{1}_{m}$.
$$
\begin{align}
I_{1} &= \begin{bmatrix}
1
\end{bmatrix} \\ \\

I_{2} &= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &0 \\
0 &1
\end{bmatrix} \\ \\

I_{m} &=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &0 &\dots &0 \\
0 &1 &\dots &0 \\
\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots  \\
0 &0 &\dots &1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

It can concisely be denoted using the [[kronecker delta]]  $I_{m} = [\delta_{ij}]_{m}$.

The identity matrix serves as the [[multiplicative identity]] of the [[matrix ring]] of all $m \times m$ matrices.

When $m \times m$ matrices are used to represent [[linear transformation]] from an $n$-dimensional [[vector space]]
to itself, the identity matrix $I_{m}$ represents the identity function, $\mathsf{id}$ for whatever [[basis]] was used in this representation.

The $i$-th [[row and column vectors|column]] of an identity matrix is the [[unit vector]] $e_{i}$, a vector whose $i$-th entry is $1$ and $0$ elsewhere. The [[determinant]] of the identity matrix $I_{m}$ is $1$, and its [[trace]] is $m$.
