The **identity matrix**, often denoted by $I_{m}$ is the [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]], [[square matrix]] defined by having entries equal to zero everywhere except for the diagonal, where they are one. In some contexts, such as [[group theory]] or [[category theory]] it's also denoted by $\mathbf{1}_{m}$.
$$
I_{m} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &\dots &0 \\

\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots  \\
0 &0 &\dots &1
\end{bmatrix}
$$


It can concisely be denoted using the [[kronecker delta]]  $I_{m} = [\delta]_{i,j}^m$.
