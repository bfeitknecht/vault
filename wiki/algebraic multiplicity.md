The **algebraic multiplicity** of the [[eigenvalues]] associated with a [[matrix]] $A \in \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}$ is a function $\mu_{A} : \mathbb{K} \to \mathbb{Z}$ defined as follows.
$$
\mu_{A}(\lambda_{j}) = \max \{ k \in \mathbb{Z} : (\lambda - \lambda_{j})^{k} \mid \chi_{A}(\lambda)  \}
$$

It denotes the number of times the given scalar $\lambda_{j}$ appears as an eigenvalue, i.e. as a root of the [[characteristic polynomial]].
