A [[arity|binary]] [[operation]] $*$ on $S$ is **distributive** over the binary operation $+$ on $S$, if it is *left-distributive* and *right-distributive*.

Formally, given a set $S$ and two binary operations $*$ and $+$ on it, the operation $*$ is **left-distributive** over $+$, if the following holds.
$$
x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z), \quad \forall x,y,z, \in S
$$

Similarly, it is **right-distributive**, if the below is true.
$$
(y + z) * x = (y * x) + (z * x), \quad \forall x,y,z, \in S
$$

When $*$ is [[commutativity|commutative]], the conditions above are logically equivalent.
