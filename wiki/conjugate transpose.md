The **complex conjugate** of a [[complex number]] is the number with an equal [[real number|real]] part and an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. That is, if 
a
{\displaystyle a} and 
b
{\displaystyle b} are real numbers then the complex conjugate of 
a
+
b
i
{\displaystyle a+bi} is 
a
−
b
i
.
{\displaystyle a-bi.} The complex conjugate of 
z
{\displaystyle z} is often denoted as 
z
¯
{\displaystyle {\overline {z}}} or 
z
∗
{\displaystyle z^{*}}.

In polar form, if 
r
{\displaystyle r} and 
φ
{\displaystyle \varphi } are real numbers then the conjugate of 
r
e
i
φ
{\displaystyle re^{i\varphi }} is 
r
e
−
i
φ
.
{\displaystyle re^{-i\varphi }.} This can be shown using Euler's formula.

The product of a complex number and its conjugate is a real number: 
a
2
+
b
2
{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}} (or 
r
2
{\displaystyle r^{2}} in polar coordinates).
