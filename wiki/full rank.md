![[full-rank-equivalences.jpeg|300]]

Some matrix $A \in \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}$ is said to be full rank if and only if $\mathrm{rank}(A) = n$, i.e. all columns exhibit [[linear independence]]. Equivalently, the following hold.
1. The [[linear system of equations (LSE)]] $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution and thus no free variables
2. $\det A \neq 0$ i.e. $A$ is invertible
3. $\mathrm{span}(A) = \mathbb{K}^{n}$
4. Zero is not an [[eigenvalue]], hence the [[nullspace (kernel)]] is trivial $\mathrm{N}(A) = \{  \mathbf{0}_{n} \}$
5.
