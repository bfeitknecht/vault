Some matrix $A \in \mathbb{K}^{m \times n}$ is said to be full rank if and only if $\mathrm{rank}(A) = n$, i.e. the [[row and column vectors]] exhibit [[linear independence]]. Equivalently, the following hold. Let $T_{A} : \mathbb{K}^{m} \to \mathbb{K}^{n}$ be the linear transformation described by $A$.
1. The [[linear system of equations (LSE)]] $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution and thus no free variables.
2. $A$ is invertible and thus $\det A \neq 0$
3. The span of the [[column vectors]] is the [[image (codomain)]] $\mathrm{C}(A) = \mathbb{K}^{n}$
5. None of the [[eigenvalues]] is zero, hence the [[nullspace (kernel)]] is trivial $\mathrm{N}(A) = \{  \mathbf{0}_{n} \}$
6.
