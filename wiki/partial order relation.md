A **partial order** [[relation]] on a [[set]] $A$ is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and [[transitive relation]]. In a [[graph]] representation, a partial order has no cycles, i.e. it's a [[directed acyclic graph (DAG)]].

# Examples

- the relations $\leq$ and $\geq$ are partial orders on $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$
- the relation $<$ and $>$ are *not* partial orders, since they aren't reflexive
- the divides relation $|$ is a partial order on $\mathbb{N}-\{ 0 \}$ or any subset of it
- the [[subset]] relation $\subseteq$ on the [[power set]] of any set $A$ is a partial order, $(\mathcal{P}(A); \subseteq)$ is a [[partially ordered set (poset)|poset]]
