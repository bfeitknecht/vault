A **partial order** [[relation]] on a [[set]] $A$ is a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] and [[transitive relation]]. In a [[graph]] representation, a partial order has no cycles, i.e. it's a [[directed acyclic graph (DAG)]].

# Examples

- the relations $\leq$ and $\geq$ are partial orders on $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$
- the relation $<$ and $>$ are **not** partial orders
