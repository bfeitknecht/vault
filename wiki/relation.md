A ([[arity|binary]]) **relation** $\rho$ from some [[set]] $A$ (domain) to another set $B$ (codomain) is a subset of $A \times B$, i.e. a set of [[tuple|2-tuples]]. If the domain is equal to the codomain, we say that $\rho$ is a relation *on* $A$. Instead of $(a, b) \in \rho$, we usually write relations in infix notation as $a \mathrel\rho b$.
