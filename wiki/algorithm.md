# What's an algorithm?

Algorithms solve (hard) problems by systematically solving easier subproblems consisting of [[elementary-operation]]s.


# Examples

## Pasture Break
![[pasture break]]

## [Karatsuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm)
![[karat]]
Algorithm to multiply two $n$ digit numbers in $\O(n^{\log_{2}3})$, instead of grade-schoo-algorithm which is in $\O(n^2)$ (conjectured by Kologorov to be asymptotically optimal for multiplication). 

We arrive at the runtime through induction.
