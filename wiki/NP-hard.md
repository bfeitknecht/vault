In computational complexity theory, a computational problem $H$ is called NP-hard if, for every problem $L$ which can be solved in [[non-deterministic]] [[polynomial-time]], there is a polynomial-time [[reduction]] from $L$ to $H$.

Informally, if $H$ is NP-hard, then it is at least as difficult to solve as the problems in [[NP]].
