A [[arity|binary]] [[operation]] $*$ on a [[set]] $S$ is **commutative**, if changing the order of the operands does not change the result, i.e. the following holds.
$$
x * y = y * x, \quad \forall x,y \in S
$$

One says that $x$ _commutes_ with $y$ or that $x$ and $y$ _commute_ under $*$. In other words, an operation is commutative if every two elements of its set commute.
