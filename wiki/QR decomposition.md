The process of **QR decomposition** writes a [[full rank]] matrix with [[linear independence]] in the columns as the product $A = QR$ of the [[matrix multiplication]] between an orthogonal and upper triangular matrix. To obtain the former, apply the [[gram-schmidt (algorithm)]], the latter is given by $R = Q^{\mathsf{T}}A$.
