A statement is mathematical [[proposition]] that can be true or false, i.e. a [[predicate]] $P:S\to\{0,1\}$ exists.

# To prove or disprove

To prove a statement $S$ means, to irrefutably show that it is true in some well-defined context. Similarily, to disprove some statement $S'$ means to show that it is false, i.e. it cannot be true.
