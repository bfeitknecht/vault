The **natural numbers**, denoted as $\mathbb N$ are $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$, possibly excluding zero which is often denoted with $\mathbb N_{+}$.

They can be thought of as a [[subset]] of the [[integer|integers]], $\mathbb Z$. In the case that zero is contained, they can be defined as the non-negative integers, else the definition as positive integers is used.
