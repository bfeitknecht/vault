A **partially ordered set**, often abbreviated as poset is a [[set]] equipped with a [[partial order relation]] $(S; \preceq)$. If any two elements are comparable, then the poset is said to be *totally ordered* $\forall s_{1}, s_{2} \in S : s_{1} \preceq s_{2} \lor s_{2} \preceq s_{1}$.

An intuitive way to depict a poset is as a [[directed acyclic graph (DAG)]] called [[hasse diagram]].
