The **outer product** of two [[vector|vectors]] is the [[matrix]] $A\in \mathbb R^{m\times n}$ whose entries are all products of an element in the first vector, $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb R^m$ with an element in the second vector, $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb R^n$.

It's denoted as $\mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u}$ or, using the [[transpose]] of $\mathbf{u}$ and overloading the [[dot product]] operator, $\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{u}^\top$.
