The **outer product** of two [[vector|vectors]] is the $m \times n$ [[matrix]] $A$ whose entries are all products of an element in the first $m$ dimensional vector, $\mathbf{v}$ with an element in the second $n$ dimensional vector, $\mathbf{u}$.

It's denoted as the [[inner product]] $\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{u}^{\mathsf{T}}$, using the [[transpose]] of $\mathbf{u}$.
