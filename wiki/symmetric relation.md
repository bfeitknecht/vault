A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on a [[set]] $A$ is called **symetric** if for all $a, b \in A$ the relation goes both ways, i.e. $a \mathrel{\rho} b \iff b \mathrel{\rho} a$. Alternatively, if the relation is equal to its [[inverse relation]], $\rho = \widehat{\rho}$.

In [[matrix]] representation of relations, symmetric means that the matrix is a [[symmetric matrix]] (with respect to the diagonal).


# Examples

The modulo relation $\equiv_{m}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is symmetric.
