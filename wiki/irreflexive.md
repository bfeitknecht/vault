A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on some [[set]] $A$ is called **irreflexive**, if no element relates to itself, i.e. the diagonal of the [[matrix]] representation is all zero. Specifically, if $a \not\mathrel{\rho} a, \forall a\in A$ or, alternatively $\mathrel{\rho} \cap\mathrel{\mathsf{id}} = \varnothing$.

Note that irreflexive is *not* the negation of [[reflexive]], i.e., a relation that is not reflexive is not necessarily irreflexive.
