A **permutation** on a [[set]] $S$ of [[cardinality]] $|S| = n$ is a [[bijection]] $\sigma : S \to S$. An **inversion** is a pair of elements $(i, j)$ such that $i < j \implies \sigma(i) > \sigma(j)$. The [[signum (function)|sign]] of a permutation $\sigma$ is determined by the number of inversions, $\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma) = (-1)^{\mathrm{inv}(\sigma)}$, where $\mathrm{inv} : \Pi_{n} \to \mathbb{N}$ denotes the number of inversions. If a permutation only swaps two elements, the others being fixed points, it's called a **transposition**. 

The set of all possible permutations on $n$ objects is denoted by $\Pi_{n}$ and forms a [[group]] under [[function composition]] and the [[identity function]], called the [[symmetric group]] denoted as $S_{n} = \langle \Pi_{n}; \circ, ^{-1}, \mathrm{id} \rangle$.

In general, permutations do not exhibit [[commutativity]]. A specific permutation $\sigma$ can be decomposed into one or more disjoint cycles which are the orbits of the cyclic group generated by it $\langle \sigma \rangle = \{ \mathrm{id}, \sigma, \sigma^{2},  \dots \}$.
A **fixed point** is an element mapped to itself, $\sigma(x) = x$, i.e. 1-cycle.

The procedure to write down a given permutation $\sigma$ on some set $S$ in cycle notation is stated below.
1. Trace the orbit of an arbitrary element $x \in S$ up to its inverse, $(x, \sigma(x), \sigma^{2}(x) \dots \sigma^{-1}(x))$
2. Continue with the next element $y \in S$, omitting fixed points $(x \dots)(y \dots) \dots$
3. Repeat until all elements of $S$ are (implicitly) written in cycles
