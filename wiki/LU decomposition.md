The **LU decomposition** for an $m \times n$ [[matrix]] $A = L U$ is achieved through [[gauss elimination]], where $L$ is lower triangular matrix achieved through gaussian elimination on $A$ and $U = I + [c_{ij}]_{i > j}$ is am upper triangular matrix where $c_{ij}$ is the multiple of row $R_{j}$ that was subtracted from row $R_{i}$ during the computation of $L$.

In the lower triangular matrix all elements above the diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero.
