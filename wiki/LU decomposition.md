The process of **LU decomposition** $A=LU$ for some $m \times n$ [[matrix]] $A$, involves finding a lower and upper triangular matrix $L, U$ respectively, such that their [[matrix multiplication]] is equal to the original matrix.

In the lower triangular matrix all elements above the diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero.
