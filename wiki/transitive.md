A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on a [[set]] $A$ is called **transitive**, if for all elements $a, b, c \in A$ it holds that $a \mathrel{\rho}b \land b \mathrel{\rho} c \implies a \mathrel{\rho} c$.

Every [[partial order relation]] and every [[equivalence relation]] is transitive. Furthermore, a relation is transitive if and only if it contains its [[composition]] with itself.

We define the [[transitive closure]] of $\mathrel{\rho}$ as the union of all powers of composition of $\mathrel{\rho}$ with itself.
