A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on a [[set]] $X$ is called **transitive**, if for all elements $a, b, c \in X$ it holds that $a \mathrel{\rho}b \land b \mathrel{\rho} c \implies a \mathrel{\rho} c$. 


Every [[partial order relation]] and every [[equivalence relation]] is transitive.
