The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of a [[random variable]] $X$ on $E = \mathbb{R}$ is the function defined by $F_{X}(x) = \Pr[X \leq x]$. It is right-continuous and monotone increasing, i.e. [[right continuous with left limit (RCLL)]], thus it is a [[bijection]] and has an [[inverse (function)]] $F_{X}^{-1}$. Additionally, it satisfies the following property.
- $\lim_{ x \to -\infty }f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = 1$
