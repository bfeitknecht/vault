The **extended real numbers** is an extension of the [[real numbers]] with $\pm \infty$. The [[set]] $\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, +\infty \}$ defines both negative and positive infinity as distinct extensions as the least and greatest elements in the total order. On the other hand, $\widehat{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{ \pm \infty \}$ has only one infinity, i.e. doesn't distinguish between positive and negative.
