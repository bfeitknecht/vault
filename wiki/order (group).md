The **order** of an [[element]] $x \in G$ in a [[group]] $\langle G; \star, {\widehat{\phantom{n}}}, e \rangle$ is the least natural number $n$ such that the $n$-th repeated operation is the [[identity element (neutral element)]].
$$
\mathrm{ord}(x) = \min\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid x^{n} = e \}
$$

The order of the group, denoted $|G|$ is defined as the number of elements in the underlying set. For any [[subgroup]] $H \subseteq G$, **lagrange's theorem** states that the order of $H$ divides that of $G$.
