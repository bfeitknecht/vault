A **search algorithm** is an [[algorithm]] designed to solve a [[search problem]], i.e. to retrieve information stored within particular [[data structure]], or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

# Examples

## Linear Search
```
begin
    for element in collection
        if element is search
            return element
        end
    end
end
```
