The **adjugate** of a [[square matrix]] $A$ is the [[transpose]] of its [[cofactor matrix]], $\mathrm{adj}(A)=C^{\mathsf{T}}$. Itâ€™s also known as *adjugate matrix* or, occasionally *adjunct matrix*.

The [[matrix-matrix multiplication]] of some [[matrix]] $A$ with its adjugate gives a [[diagonal matrix]] with entries equal to the [[determinant]] of $A$, i.e. $A \cdot \mathrm{adj}(A) = \det(A) \cdot I_{n}$.
