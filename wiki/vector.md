A **vector** $v$ is just a list of $m$ [[real number]], $v \in \mathbb R^m$, and can be interpreted as an $m$-dimensional point or an arrow from the [[origin]] to that point (translation).


# Notation

We can denote a [[sequence]] of vectors of length $n$ $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n} = (v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n})$ as $(v_{j})^{n}_{j=1}$

We can denote a [[set]] of vectors of [[order]] $n$ $\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{n}\} = \{v_{j} | j \in [n]\}$, where $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

A single vector $v$ in $m$-dimensional space is denoted as $v=\begin{bmatrix} v_{1}\\ v_{2}\\ \vdots\\ v_{m} \end{bmatrix} =[v_{i}]^{m}_{i=1}$.
