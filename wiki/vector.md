A **vector** $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb R^m$ describes a point in an $m$-dimensional [[euclidian space]] with some magnitude from the [[origin]] and direction (translation). Vectors can be added and scaled to form a [[vector space]]. We can interpret it as an ordered list of $m$ [[real number|real numbers]]

# Vector Notation

We can denote a [[sequence]] of vectors of length $n$, i.e. $\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}, \dots, \mathbf{v}_{n} = (\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}, \dots, \mathbf{v}_{n})$ as $(\mathbf{v}_{j})^{n}_{j=1}$

Similarily, we can denote a [[set]] of vectors of [[order]] $n$, i.e. $\{\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}, \dots, \mathbf{v}_{n}\} = \{\mathbf{v}_{j} | j \in [n]\}$, where $[n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

A single vector $v$ in $m$-dimensional space is denoted as $\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix} v_{1}\\ v_{2}\\ \vdots\\ v_{m} \end{bmatrix} =[\mathbf{v}_{i}]^{m}_{i=1}$.
