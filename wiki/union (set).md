The **union** of two sets $A, B$ is defined as all the [[element|elements]] that are in $A$ *or* $B$.
$$
A \cup B \overset{\text{def.}}{=} \{ x \mid x \in A \vee x \in B\}
$$
We can extend this definition from two to an arbitrary collection of sets. Let $\mathcal A$ be a non-empty set of sets, each with finite or infinite cardinality. Then we define the union of all sets in $\mathcal A$ as the set of all $x$ that are an element of at least one of the sets in $\mathcal A$.
$$
\bigcup \mathcal A \overset{\text{def.}}{=} \{x \mid \exists A \in \mathcal A, x \in A\}
$$
