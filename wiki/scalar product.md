The **scalar product** (or dot product) of two [[vector|vectors]] $v, w \in \R^m$ is defined as
$$
v \cdot w \def \sum_{i=1}^{m}{v_{i}w_{i}}
$$
and can be denoted with $\langle v, w \rangle$ or $v \cdot w$. If $v$ and $w$ are [[row and column vectors|column vectors]], the dot product can also be denoted as
