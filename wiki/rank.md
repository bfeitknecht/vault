The **rank** of some matrix $A\in \mathbb R^{m\times n}$ is the number of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[row and column vectors|row or column vectors]] and is denoted with $\mathrm{rank}(A)$. It measures the dimension of the image of the [[linear transformation]] described by $A$.

The column rank and row rank are always equal. For the special case of the rank being zero, $A$ must be the [[zero matrix]], i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(A)=0 \implies A=\mathbf{0}$.

$\mathrm{rank}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A^{\top})$
