The **rank** of some $m \times n$ [[matrix]] $A$ is the number of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[row and column vectors|row or column vectors]] and is denoted with $\mathrm{rank}(A)$. It measures the [[dimension]] of the [[image]] of the [[linear transformation]] described by $A$.

The column rank and row rank are always equal. For the special case of the rank being zero, $A$ must be the [[zero matrix]], i.e. $\mathrm{rank}(A)=0 \implies A=0_{m, n}$.

$\mathrm{rank}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A^{\mathsf{T}})$
