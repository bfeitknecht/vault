Let $A=[a_{ij}]$ be an $m\times n$ [[matrix]], then the **transpose** of $A$ is the $n\times m$ matrix $A^\top=[a_{ji}]$. The transpose can be thought of as the mirror image along the main diagonal. The transpose of some [[vector]] translates it between [[row and column vectors]]. For all matrices it holds that $(A^\top)^\top=A$.

# Matrix Definitions w/ Transpose

A [[square matrix]] whose transpose is equal to itself is called a [[symetric matrix]]; that is, $A$ is symmetric if
$$
A=A^\top
$$
- $A$ is a [[symetric matrix]] $\iff A = A^\top$
