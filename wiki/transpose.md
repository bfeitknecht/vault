Let $A=[a_{ij}]$ be an $m\times n$ [[matrix]], then the **transpose** of $A$ is the $n\times m$ matrix $A^\top=[a_{ji}]$. The transpose can be thought of as the mirror image along the main diagonal. The transpose of some [[vector]] translates it between [[row and column vectors]].

# Matrix Definitions w/ Trans
For all matrices it holds that $(A^\top)^\top=A$. 
For a [[symetric matrix]] $A \iff A = A^\top$ holds.
