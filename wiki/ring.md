A **ring** is an algebra $\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot, 1 \rangle$, such that the following holds.
- $(\mathrm{i})$    The addition [[operation]], its [[inverse (operation)]], and the respective [[identity element (neutral element)]] form a (commutative) [[group]] $\langle R; +, -, 0 \rangle$.
- $(\mathrm{ii})$   The multiplication operation, its inverse and neutral element form a [[monoid]] $\langle R; \cdot, 1 \rangle$.
- $(\mathrm{ii})$   The multiplication operation distributes over the addition operation.

If multiplication is commutative the ring is called *commutative ring*. The axioms are not minimal, the group's commutativity isn't required as it's implied by the others. Furthermore we have the following.

The **characteristic** of a ring is the order of the additive identity element, i.e. $\mathrm{ord}(1)$.

A **unit** $u$ is an element of a ring $R$ that has a [[multiplicative inverse]] i.e. $uv = vu = 1$ for some $v \in R$. In that case we write $v = u^{-1}$. The set of units of $R$ is denoted by $R^{*}$ and forms a multiplicative group (of units in $R$).


# Examples

- $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ are all commutative rings
- $\mathbb{Z}_{m}$ is a commutative ring
