The **equivalence class** for some [[equivalence relation]] $\mathrel{\theta}$ on a [[set]] $A$ is the set of elements in $A$ that are *equivalent* to $a$, denoted as $[a]_{\theta} \overset{ \text{def.} }{ = } \{ b \in A \mid b \mathrel{\theta} a \}$.

Two trivial equivalence relations on a set $A$ are the complete relation $A \times A$, for which there is only one equivalence class $A$, and the [[identity relation]] for which the equivalence classes are all simply [[singletons]] $\{ a \}$ for all $a \in A$.
