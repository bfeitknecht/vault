#todo 

A **function** $f : X \to Y$ assigns to each element of the [[set]] $X$ exactly one element of $Y$. The set $X$ is called the [[domain]] of the function and the set $Y$ is called the [[image (codomain)]] of the function.

Functions are a special type of [[relation]], namely they are well defined. That means, every element in the domain maps to exactly one element in the codomain.
