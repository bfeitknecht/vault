The **identity relation** $\mathrel{\mathsf{id}}$ is the easiest case of an [[equivalence relation]]. It relates every element of some [[set]] to itself, $x \mathrel{\mathsf{id}} x, \ \forall x \in X$. In [[matrix]] representation, it equals the [[identity matrix]] with dimension of the set's cardinality $|X|$


It's [[graph]] representation is given below.
