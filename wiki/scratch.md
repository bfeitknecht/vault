```desmos-graph
y1 = 1 / x
y2 = x
```
maybe there is another dimension to numbers that allows for division by zero?

restrict the kernel through evaluation
do something with the cokernel




Let $\pi_{x} : \mathrm{SL}(n, \mathbb{Z}[x]) \to \mathrm{SL}(n, \mathbb{Z})$ which *reduces* an element $\pi_{x}(A) \mapsto A[x \mapsto 0]$, substituting the indeterminate with zero. Then, let $\Gamma(X) = \ker (\pi_{x}) = [I_{n}]_{\equiv_{X\mathbb{Z}[x]}}$, i.e. the equivalence class of the identity matrix. Now $\widetilde{\Gamma}(N) = \Gamma(X) \big|_{x=N}$ is the set of its evaluations at $N$. Finally, is $\widetilde{\Gamma}(N) = \Gamma(N) = [I_{n}]_{\equiv_{N\mathbb{Z}}}$? It holds true for $N \leq 8$.
