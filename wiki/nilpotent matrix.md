A **nilpotent [[matrix]]** $N \in \Mat_{n}(\mathbb{K})$ is a [[square matrix]] such that there exists a positiv integer $k \in \mathbb{N}_{+}$, called the **index** or degree of $N$ where the $k$ fold self [[matrix-matrix multiplication]] yields the [[zero matrix]].
$$
N^{k} = 0
$$
In particular, any $n$-dimensional [[triangular matrix]] with zero on the main diagonal is nilpotent
