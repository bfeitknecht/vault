The **satisfiability** problem (abbr. SAT) states that proving that some [[formula (propositional logic)|logical formula]] $F$ is satisfiable for some choice of its free variables is [[NP-hard]].

**Unsatisfiability** means, that there exists no [[interpretation]] that makes a formula $F$ satisfiable. In that case we write $F\equiv\bot$.
