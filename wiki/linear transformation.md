A **linear transformation**, also known as a **linear map**, is applying some [[matrix]] $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ to an element in a [[vector space]], i.e. a [[vector]] $\mathrm{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Specific matrix types result in unique transformations. Linear transformations can be [[composition|composed]].

Such a map can be defined as a [[function]] $T_{A}:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ and exhibits two axioms.
