A [[matrix]] is in **row echelon form (REF)** if it can be obtained as a result from [[gauss elimination]]. Every matrix can be put into REF by applying a sequence of elementary row operations.

Let $R=[r_{ij}]_{m, n}$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Then $R$ is in *row echelon form* if there exist $r \leq m$ column indices $j_{l\in[r]}$
