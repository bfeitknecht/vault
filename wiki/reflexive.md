A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on a [[set]] $A$ is called **reflexive**, if every element relates to itself. In particular, the [[identity relation]] $\mathsf{id}$ is subset of every reflexive relation.

In [[matrix]] representation, reflexive means that the diagonal entries are equal to the [[kronecker delta]], i.e. all $1$. In a [[graph]] representation, reflexive means that every [[vertex]] has an edge to itself.
