A **transition system** is a [[tuple]] $(\Gamma, T, \to)$ where $\Gamma$ is a [[set]] of configurations, $T\subseteq \Gamma$ is a set of terminal configurations and ${\to} \subseteq \Gamma \times \Gamma$ is the transition [[relation]]. There are two types of configurations.
1. $\langle \mathsfit{s}, \sigma \rangle$ represents that the statement $\mathsfit{s}$ is to be executed in state $\sigma$
2. $\sigma$ which represents a final state (terminal configuration)

The transition relation is specified by inference rules.
