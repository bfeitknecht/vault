A **minor** $M_{ij}$ of a a [[matrix]] $A=[a_{ij}]_{m, n}$ is the [[determinant]] of some [[square matrix|square]] [[submatrix]] induced by removing one or more [[row and column vectors]]. If we remove exactly the $i$-th row vector $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ and the $j$-th column vector $\mathbf{v}_{j}$, the resulting minor is called the *first minor*.

First minors, specifically their signed [[cofactor]] variants are the basis for constructing the [[cofactor matrix]].
