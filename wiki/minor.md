A **minor** $m_{i, j}$ of a a [[matrix]] $A=[a_{i, j}]_{m, n}$ is the [[determinant]] of some [[square matrix|square]] [[submatrix]] induced by removing one or more [[row and column vectors]]. If we remove exactly the $i$-th row vector $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ and the $j$-th column vector $\mathbf{v}_{j}$, the resulting minor is called *first minor*.

A first minors $m_{i, j}$, multiplied with $(-1)^{i+j}$ is precisely the [[cofactor]] $c_{i, j}$ which define the [[cofactor matrix]].
