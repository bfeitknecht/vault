The **selection sort** algorithm fulfills the same invariant as [[bubble sort (algorithm)]], after $j$ iterations the $j$ largest elements are in the correct position, $I(j) = A[1 .. j] \uparrow$.

```
function selectionsort(A)
	for i in n .. 1
		let k = argmax(A[i..j]) // index of maximum of j first elements
		
end
```
