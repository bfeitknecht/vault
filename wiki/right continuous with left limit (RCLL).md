A [[function]] $f : X \to Y$ is **right continuous with left limit (RCLL)** everywhere if it's continuous to the right and has a left limit everywhere. Specifically, it satisfies the following properties.
1. $f$ is nondecreasing (monotonic), $\forall x, x' \in A. x \leq x' \implies f(x) \leq f(x')$
2. $f$ is right continuous, $\forall x. f(x) = \lim_{ h \to 0^{+} } f(x + h)$
