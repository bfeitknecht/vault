A **vector subspace** or **linear subspace** $U$ of a [[vector space]] $V$ is a non-empty [[subset]] of $V$ that exhibits [[closure]] under [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]], i.e. the sum of two elements of $U$ and the product of an element  of $U$ by a scalar belongs to $U$. This implies that every [[linear combination]] of elements of $U$ belongs to $U$.

A subspace is a *vector space* for the induced addition and scalar multiplication, i.e. the closure property implies that the axioms of a vector space are satisfied. The closure property also implies that every [[intersection]] of linear subspaces is a linear subspace.

Every vector spaces is equipped with at least two (trivial) vector subspaces, the *zero vector space* consisting of the zero vector alone and the entire vector space itself.
