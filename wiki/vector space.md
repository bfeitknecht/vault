A **vector space** or a **linear space** is a [[set]] whose elements, often called [[vector|vectors]], can be *added* together and *multiplied* by some *scalars*. The operations of [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]] must satisfy the vector axioms listed below. The associated scalars can be elements of any [[field]]. Formally, we can construct vector spaces over any field $F$.

# Properties

## Subspaces
![[vector subspace]]


## Basis
![[basis (vector space)]]


## Dimension
![[dimension (vector space)]]


# Examples

- $(\mathbb{R}^{m}, +, \cdot)$, with $+$ as in definition 1.1 and $\cdot$ as in definition 1.3 forms a vector space, i.e. the *real vector space*
- $(\mathbb{C}^{m}, +, \cdot)$, dito for scalars as [[complex number]] forms the *complex vector space*
- $(\mathbb{R}[x], +, \cdot)$, where $\mathbb{R}[x]$ denotes the set of polynomials with one variable is another vector space
- $(\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, +, \cdot)$, on the set of $\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ matrices with [[matrix multiplication]] and scalar multiplication defined in the usual sense is a vector space
