The **intersection** of two sets $A, B$ is defined as all [[element|elements]] that are in $A$ *and* $B$.
$$
A \cap B \overset{\text{def.}}{=} \{ x \mid x \in A \wedge x \in B\}
$$

We can extend this definition from two to an arbitrary collection of sets. Let $\mathcal A$ be a non-empty set of sets, each with finite or infinite cardinality. Then we define the intersection of all sets in $\mathcal A$ as the set of all $x$ that are an element in all of the sets in $\mathcal A$.
$$
\bigcap \mathcal A \overset{\text{def.}}{=} \{ x \mid \forall A \in \mathcal A, x \in A\}
$$
