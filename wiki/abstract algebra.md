An **abstract algebra** is [[tuple|2-tuple]] $\langle S; \Omega \rangle$ of a non-empty [[set]] $S$ called the *carrier* or the *domain* with a collection $\Omega = (\omega_{1}, \dots, \omega_{n})$ of [[operation|operations]] on $S$. Additionally, it exhibits a finite number of axioms.


# Axioms

## Equational Axioms

An axiom of an algebraic structure often has the form of an [[identity]], that is, an equation such that the two sides are [[expressions]] that involve operations of the algebraic structure and [[variable|variables]]. If the variables in the identity are replaced by arbitrary elements of the algebraic structure, the equality must remain true.

## Existential Axioms

Some common axioms contain an existential clause. In general, such a clause can be avoided by introducing further operations, and replacing the existential clause by an identity involving the new operation. We don't do this.
