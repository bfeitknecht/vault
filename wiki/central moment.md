The $n$-th **central moment**, i.e. [[moment]] about the [[expected value|mean]] $\mu$ of a real valued [[random variable]] $X$ is defined as follows.
$$
\mu_{n} = \Ex[(X - \mu])^{n}]
$$

For a continuous univariate probability distribution with [[probability density|density]] $f(x)$ it equals the [[integral]] below.
$$
\mu_{n} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}(x - \mu)^{n} f(x) \d x
$$
