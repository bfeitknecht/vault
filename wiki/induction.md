$$
\forall P \bigg(P(0) \land \forall k \big(P(k) \to P(k+1) \big) \to \forall n(P(n) \bigg)
$$
**Mathematical induction** is a method for [[proof|proving]] that a [[statement]] $P(n)$ is true for every [[natural number]] $n$, that is, that the infinitely many cases $P(0),P(1),P(2),P(3),\dots$  all hold. This is done by first proving a simple case, then also showing that if we assume the claim is true for a given case, then the next case is also true.

It consists of two parts, the **base case**
