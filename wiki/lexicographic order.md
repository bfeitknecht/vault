The **lexicographic order** $\leq_{\mathrm{lex}}$ is a [[partial order relation]] on a [[set]]. For the [[cross product]] between two [[partially ordered set (poset)]] $()A; \preceq) \times (B; \sqsubseteq)$ it's defined as below.
$$
(a_{1}, b_{1}) \leq_{\mathrm{lex}} (a_{2}, b_{2}) \iff a_{1} \prec a_{2} \lor (a_{1} = a_{2} \land b_{1} \sqsubseteq b_{2})
$$
