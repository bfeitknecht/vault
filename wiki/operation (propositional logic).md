The [[operation (propositional logic)|logical operators]] in [[propositional logic]] are [[function|functions]], where $\neg$ is a function $\{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}$ and $\land$ and $\lor$ are functions $\{0,1\} \times \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}$. These functions can be described by function tables, as follows:
