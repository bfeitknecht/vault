# What is an alphabet?

An alphabet is a set of characters, like $\Sigma=\{a. b, c\}$. Those elements can be combined to form [[word]]s. $\Sigma^*$ denotes the [[transitive closure]] over the alphabet, i.e. all possible ways to make words. Let $|\Sigma| =k$ denote the order of the alphabet, $|w|=n$ the length of some word $w$, then there are $k^n$ words of length $n$ over $\Sigma$.
