A ([[deterministic]]) **finite state machine** (FSM) is a [[tuple|quintuple]] $M =(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F)$, where 

1. $Q$ is a finite, non-empty [[set]] of **states**
2. $\Sigma$ is an [[alphabet]], called **input alphabet**
3. $q_{0}\in Q$ is the **initial state**
4. $F\subseteq Q$ is the set of **accepted states**
5. $\delta:Q \times\Sigma \to Q$ is the **state-transition [[function]]**

A **configuration** of $M$ is an element
