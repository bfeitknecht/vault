Consider the following two [[word|words]] of 32 lowercase letters and digits:
`abababababababababababababababab`, and `4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7`.

The first string has a short English-language description, namely "write ab 16 times", which consists of 17 characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, i.e., "write 4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7" which has 38 characters. Hence the operation of writing the first string can be said to have "less **complexity**" than writing the second.
