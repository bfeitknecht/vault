A **partition** of a [[set]] $A$ is a set of [[mutually disjoint]] [[subset|subsets]] of $A$ that cover $A$, i.e., a set $\{ S_{i} \mid i \in \mathcal{I} \}$ of sets $S_{i}$ (for some [[index set]] $\mathcal{I}$) satisfying $S_{i} \cap S_{j} = \varnothing$ for $i \neq j$ and $\bigcup_{i \in \mathcal{I}}S_{i}=A$.

The set of [[equivalence class|equivalence classes]] of an [[equivalence relation]] $\mathrel{\theta}$, denoted by $A/\theta \overset{ \text{def.} }{ = }\{ [a]_{\theta} \mid a \in A \}$, is called the *quotient set of $A$ by $\theta$* or simply $A \mathrel{\mathrm{mod}} \theta$. It forms a *partition* of $A$.
