A [[arity|binary]] [[relation]] $\mathrel{\rho}$ on some [[set]] $A$ is called **antisymmetric** if for all $a,  \in A$ it holds, that their bidirectional relation implies they are the same [[element]].

In a [[graph]] representation, antisymmetric means that there is no [[cycle]] of length 2, i.e., no distinct [[vertex|vertices]] $a$ and $b$ with $(a, b) \in A$ and $(b, a) \in A$. Note that antisymmetric is not the negation of [[symmetric relation]].
