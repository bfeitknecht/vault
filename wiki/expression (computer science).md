An **expression** is a syntactic entity that may *evaluate* to some *value*, determined by the content of the code block.

It's a combination of one or more *constants*, *variables*, *functions*, and *operators* that the programming language interprets (according to its particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a stateful environment) another value.
