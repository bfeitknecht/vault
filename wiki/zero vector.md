The zero vector is the [[neutral element]] in some [[vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^m$ with respect to [[vector addition]], i.e. the [[vector]] that applies no translation. It is denoted as $\mathbf{0}$ or $\vec{0}$.

$$
\mathbf{0} \overset{\text{def.}}{=}
\begin{cases}
\varnothing, &m=0 \\
[0]^{m}_{i=1}, &m > 0\\
\end{cases}
$$
